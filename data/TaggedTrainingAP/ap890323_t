 A sheriff who came out against semiautomatic weapons found his fears borne out only hours later when a gunman cut a bloody path through his district, killing two people and wounding three, including two deputies. During Thursday's rampage by a man wielding a semiautomatic MAC-11 machine pistol, <LOCATION> Arapahoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> again lashed out at the sale of such weapons. `` Our officers are out-gunned by these weapons of war. These guns are designed to kill and maim people,'' he said. He held up a blood-stained revolver one of his deputies had used against Thursday's suspect, and said the deputy was totally out-gunned. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said the MAC-11 can hold 32 rounds and fire 10 times faster than the standard .38 - caliber pistol issued to all deputy Deputies said 20-year-old <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> went on a 12-hour rampage in which he abducted a woman, killed her and her mother-in-law, raped another woman, shot two police officers, shot a hostage in the back and then killed himself Thursday, ending 12 hours of terror. In his position paper issued Wednesday, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said, `` I am a western Coloradan who enjoys big game hunting and I do n't want to see anything that would hurt sport hunting. But we have to do something about these weapons of war.'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said laws should be tightened to control who can buy such weapons, and if they ca n't be controlled, he urged the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> to pass a law to ban their sale. In his paper, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> cited the January shooting in <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, in which five children were killed and 29 children and a school teacher were wounded by a man carrying a copy of the Chinese-made AK-47 semiautomatic rifle. `` This tragic event has stimulated city, county, state and federal legislative efforts to control or ban these weapons of war,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> has approved a ban on 40 types of assault-type weapons, and similar bills are pending in other states. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Administration temporarily has banned the import of semiautomatic assault rifles. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s paper said that although the Constitution gives citizens the right to import, manufacture, sell and possess semiautomatic weapons, there is also `` a burden to place some reasonable controls on these weapons of war without abridging the sportsman's right to legitimate sporting rifles.'' `` I do not propose their absolute ban, but simply to bring them under the same or similar controls'' as machine guns, silencers, sawed-off rifles, sawed-off shotguns, anti-tank guns, bazookas, mortars, and caneguns, he said. Included in his list of weapons to be restricted are the MAC-10 and MAC-11, the gun used in Thursday's attacks. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said recent raids in <LOCATION> Arapahoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> have netted a fully automatic AK-47, a fully automatic MAC-10 with a silencer, an AR-15 and a semi-automatic shotgun.

 A man named <PERSON> Noid </PERSON> who believed he was the target of Domino's Pizza's `` Avoid the Noid'' advertising, was ruled mentally incompetent Wednesday to stand trial for holding two Domino's employees hostage. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Noid </PERSON>, 22, of <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, could be tried later under an order entered by Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Tillman </PERSON>. For the next 90 days, he is to be evaluated by the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>. The department `` will decide whether he's likely to become competent,'' <LOCATION> DeKalb </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Public Defender <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> said. `` We do n't know at this point what Mr. <PERSON> Noid </PERSON>'s prospects are.'' Police said Noid apparently believed that the advertising campaign, which features a mischievous animated character called `` The Noid,'' was directed at him. He held two hostages at gunpoint for nearly six hours Jan. 30 at a Domino's Pizza outlet in <LOCATION> Chamblee </LOCATION>, east of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, and at one point fired four shots into the ceiling. The hostages finally escaped when he turned his back. During the standouff, Noid demanded $ 100,000, a getaway car and a science fiction novel. He also ordered and ate a pizza. <ORGANIZATION> Chamblee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said <PERSON> Noid </PERSON> told police that he thinks <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Monaghan </PERSON>, owner of the Detroit-based pizza chain and the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> baseball team, `` comes into his apartment and looks around.'' A grand jury indicted Noid on two counts of aggravated assault, two counts of false imprisonment, one count of possessing a firearm in the commission of a crime and one count of attempted theft by deception.

 Corn is king in this small town, but officials have turned a deaf ear on a proposal to feature the vegetable in a new city logo. Officials met Tuesday at a table lined with corn-emblazoned coffee mugs that city Administrator <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Belcher </PERSON> said could be used to help promote <ORGANIZATION> Auburn </ORGANIZATION>. But leaders opted for a contest to create an easier-to-swallow emblem, <PERSON> Belcher </PERSON> said. `` We're trying to get a little more notoriety,'' he said, adding that many people never heard of the farming community of 1,900 residents. Officials in the town 100 miles north of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> will work with schools this fall to come up with a new logo for road signs, promotions and a city flag, <PERSON> Belcher </PERSON> said.

 The mayor of a <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> suburb who ordered three <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Somville </PERSON> frescoes to be painted over because she found them too glaring has asked the Belgian artist to restore them _ for free.

 Eight out of 10 Soviet citizens want their government to be modeled more on Western lines, according to an opinion poll conducted for a leftist French magazine.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> have been on speaking terms for a decade, but it's the relationship of next-door neighbors who keep a wary eye on each other. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> is whole again on the maps. Under the peace treaty signed March 26, 1979, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> returned most of the Sinai in 1982, 15 years after capturing in the 1967 war. It completed the turnover last week by delivering <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION>, a tiny beach enclave on the Gulf of <LOCATION> Aqaba </LOCATION>. Oil wells in <LOCATION> Sinai </LOCATION> and the Gulf of <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION>, developed under Israeli occupation, pump money into <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which under President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> sponsored the first peace between Arab and Jew, provides more than $ 2 billion a year in aid. Even the Arab diplomatic boycott caused by the treaty has ended except for <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. There will be no celebration of the 10th anniversary, however. For the average Egyptian there is little to show for the government's cool friendship with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> except juicier grapes, redder strawberries and fatter cucumbers in the market. Peace `` is so important to the Israelis and Arabs,'' President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> said after the red, black and white Egyptian flag rose over <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION> for the first time in 22 years. `` It is worth whatever concession.'' He called for mutual flexibility to solve the remaining problem, which has led to four <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> wars: the future of the Palestinians. <PERSON> Butros </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghali </PERSON>, minister of state for foreign affairs, said <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION> could be the key: `` Solving the <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION> problem peacefully ... opens the door to joint action ... to solve the Palestinian problem.'' By terms like flexibility and joint action, Egyptian officials mean <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should change its policy, negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and give back <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> territories occupied since 1967. Egyptians tend to mistrust <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> because of the four wars and many years of regarding it as the eternal enemy. <PERSON> Ghali </PERSON> once characterized the relationship as Cold Peace. Many Israeli tourists visit <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> but few Egyptians go the other way. The government discourages trips to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and some prosperous Egyptians say it is too expensive. Also, Egyptians generally sympathize with the Palestinians, especially since the uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation began in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> more than 15 months ago. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> often asks <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> to use friendlier language and fully implement treaty provisions designed to improve relations through trade, tourism and cultural exchanges. Experts on both sides say agricultural technology is about the only field in which cooperation flourishes. <PERSON> Hany </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Nour </PERSON>, whose company sells irrigation systems that involve Israeli innovations, said the advantage of working with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is `` that our climatic conditions are similar.'' Most of his clients are former expatriate workers home from Arab oil states with money to invest. `` They are broad-minded and ready to accept new techniques,'' <PERSON> Abdel-Nour </PERSON> said. `` Some people had reservations at the beginning, but after a while their misgivings vanished.'' Another businessman who uses Israeli technology is a former ranking army officer who fought in the 1967 war, was captured and spent eight months as an prisoner of war. The officer, who requested anonymity, grows grapes with Israeli know-how and equipment. `` This has no relation to war,'' he said. `` My brother was killed in the war, so my hard feelings should be double, but I still take technology from them.'' His family is less pragmatic. The former officer said his wife refuses to socialize with his <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> colleagues. Four years after President <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, and two after he signed the peace treaty, Moslem extremists assassinated him in 1981. <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>'s campaign to win over Egyptians included repeated promises of prosperity for a people shackled with spending billions on war. Early in the peace decade, billboards depicted a long-stemmed red rose with a slogan assuring citizens of a happy future. Now the bloom is off the rose. `` I was against the whole peace move,'' said <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON>, a young agriculture graduate. `` I was n't fooled that the treaty would bring prosperity. You can see there is no prosperity; quite the contrary.'' Rising inflation aggravated by mismanagement, corruption and lower prices for oil exports has disappointed many Egyptians and dashed much of <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>'s dream, although none of it can be blamed on the treaty. <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION> will be a test for both sides. Egyptian and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> employees will work together in large numbers for the first time, at a resort hotel <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> bought from its Israeli owner. `` I do n't know how it'll be, working with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>,'' cook <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Zerber </PERSON> said on the day the Egyptians took over. `` I do n't know whether I'll accept taking orders from them.'' Egyptian law requires that 90 percent of a company's employees be Egyptian, but when and or how that will be implemented at <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION> is unclear. About 20 waiters and cooks sent from <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> arrived minutes after the 326-room hotel became Egyptian and filed into the poolside dining room to take instructions from their <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> counterparts.

 If the Academy Award race for supporting actor goes according to form, the winner would be <PERSON> Alec </PERSON> <PERSON> Guinness </PERSON> for `` Little Dorrit.'' Or so the experts say. After all, the reasoning goes, for the past three years the award has gone to veterans who have amassed an impressive body of work: <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Ameche </PERSON>, `` Cocoon,'' 1985; <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Caine </PERSON>, `` <PERSON> Hannah </PERSON> and Her Sisters,'' 1986; <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Connery </PERSON>, `` The Untouchables,'' 1987. The trouble is that Academy Award voters do n't always follow tradition, and some of them may have had trouble sitting through the six hours of `` Little Dorrit.'' The British-made film is based on <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickens </PERSON>' last, often overlooked novel. Guinness, <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> winner as best actor for `` The Bridge on the River Kwai'' in 1957, was cast as <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorrit </PERSON>, longtime resident of debtors' prison. `` The character itself I found fascinating,'' said the 74-year-old actor in a magazine interview, `` because in many ways it's unsympathetic, feckless and foolish. You know, you'd like to kick him. ... And yet, at the same time, there is a sympathy for him because of the social situation at that time, being chucked into prison for 20-odd years for debt.'' But Oscar voters other veterans for whom to vote. First, there's <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Landau </PERSON>, nominated for `` Tucker: The Man and His Dream. For 30 years he has been contributing solid performances in films such as `` North by <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, `` Cleopatra'' and `` <PERSON> Nevada </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>,'' though he is best known as the master of disguises in the original TV series `` Mission: Impossible.'' <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Coppola </PERSON> gave <PERSON> Landau </PERSON> the role of his life as <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> <PERSON> Karatz </PERSON>, financial adviser to car builder <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>. Of <PERSON> Coppola </PERSON>, <PERSON> Landau </PERSON>, 54, remarks: `` Like all the good ones, he lets you go. He hires you, that's a vote of confidence. <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> really creates a background for you. The more you bring the happier he is.'' <PERSON> Landau </PERSON> is a director of the Actors Studio in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, and he prepared for the role with customary thoroughness. Once an illustrator for the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, he drew portraits of <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> and analyzed him as `` a lonely <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> businessman who really has no family, no friends and no life outside work.'' Then there's <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Stockwell </PERSON>, nominated as the outrageous Mafia don in `` Married to the Mob.'' He's been in films for 46 of his 52 years. The son of singer <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Stockwell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> was a child actor in such films as `` Anchors Aweigh,'' `` Gentleman's Agreement'' and `` The Boy With the Green Hair.'' His career since then has been a roller coaster: obscurity after his child-star days; success as a young man in `` Compulsion,'' `` Sons and Lovers'' and other films; descent into hippiedom during the 1960s. He tried to return to acting after cleaning up his act, but found jobs scarce. Thinking his career over, he and wife, <PERSON> Joy </PERSON>, moved to <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>, N.M. Suddenly, producers were sending for him. <PERSON> Stockwell </PERSON> credits director <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Demme </PERSON> for taking a chance on him in `` Married to the Mob.'' He remarked: `` No one had ever thought of me for this type of role. It's a romantic comedy, and I play a charismatic guy who chases after women and people are afraid of, and it's charming and funny. Prior to that, everyone always thought of me as this serious actor who plays psychotics and neurotics and sensitive people.'' <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kline </PERSON> won his nomination as the madcap but vicious underworld type in `` A Fish Called <PERSON> Wanda </PERSON>.'' Known for his flamboyant roles in the theater, <PERSON> Kline </PERSON>, 41, has created a series of indelible performances on the screen: as <PERSON> Meryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Streep </PERSON>'s erratic lover in `` Sophie's Choice''; the college reunion host in `` The Big Chill''; the swashbuckling buccaneer in `` The Pirates of Penzance.'' The actor believes that his screen potential has n't been reached: `` I've done tons of roles on the stage that I have n't even approached on the screen. I see my film career as wide open. I'd like to do serious dramas, love stories, action-adventures, comedies No one has pigeonholed me yet, and I hope to keep it that way.'' The youngest nominee is 18-year-old <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, named for his `` Running on Empty'' role as the son of political activists on the run from the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> has established himself as one of the screen's best young actors in such films as `` Stand by Me,'' `` The Mosquito Coast'' and `` Little Nikita.'' As part of a free-thinking family that was repeatedly on the move, <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> had a similar childhood to the one he portrays in `` Running on Empty.'' He believes that his peripatetic upbringing was good training for acting. `` I think it helps you become versatile in adapting to new situations, new atmospheres, new people, just as you do when you go from film to film,'' he said. `` It also gives you an insight on different forms of life and different perspectives.''

<TEXT>
 While Solidarity seeks agreement with authorities at round-table talks, the small but noisy Confederation for an Independent <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> has stepped up street protests in a drive for followers to fight communism. Shouts of `` <ORGANIZATION> KPN </ORGANIZATION>,'' the group's initials in Polish, can be heard at most demonstrations these days. Its banners painted with a black anchor, the symbol of the Polish resistance during World War II, often appear in the front ranks of marches, even those called by other groups. `` Strikes and demonstrations awaken people's emotions and they become enthusiastic,'' said <PERSON> Zygmunt </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenyk </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> KPN </ORGANIZATION> leader in <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>. `` It's easier to awaken the enthusiasm of people who strike and demonstrate than among those who sit.'' <PERSON> Lenyk </PERSON>'s tiny <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> apartment serves as the headquarters for a determined core of young activists dedicated to publicizing the name of the organization, even though it is illegal. <ORGANIZATION> KPN </ORGANIZATION> is the largest and most active of a range of smaller opposition groups that reject cooperation with the government and criticize Solidarity on grounds that it is too moderate. The groups, which also include Fighting Solidarity and the banned <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, have become more active in recent months and appear to be trying to coordinate activities through joint meetings of the self-styled `` anti-system opposition.'' During a recent national <ORGANIZATION> KPN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> congress </ORGANIZATION>, a small brigade of young people covered city walls with black anchors until they ran out of paint, while more than 200 of their elders debated the organization's future strategy. `` If we want to be a civilized country, we must liquidate socialism,'' <PERSON> Lenyk </PERSON> said. `` We have to become a parliamentary country, and we want to liquidate communism.'' Socialism and communism often are used interchangeably. <ORGANIZATION> KPN </ORGANIZATION>'s straightforward strategy has begun to win new sympathizers, many of whom once belonged to Solidarity. But <ORGANIZATION> KPN </ORGANIZATION> is far from becoming a movement on the scale of Solidarity, which as a labor union claimed 10 million members in 1981. <ORGANIZATION> KPN </ORGANIZATION> claims an active membership of 1,600 and 1,000 more in youth organizations. <ORGANIZATION> KPN </ORGANIZATION> was founded by the historian <PERSON> Leszek </PERSON> <PERSON> Moczulski </PERSON> on Sept. 1, 1979, the 40th anniversary of <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s invasion of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Supporters say they are attracted by the clarity of <ORGANIZATION> KPN </ORGANIZATION>'s call for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s independence from Communist authorities and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Though the group claims to favor a peaceful path to independence, young members of <ORGANIZATION> KPN </ORGANIZATION> often wear military caps and pants and shirts made of camouflage fabric and have thrown stones at police in protests. They say such action is taken only in self-defense. The organization's militarism and staunch anti-communism has resulted in a rift between <ORGANIZATION> KPN </ORGANIZATION> and Solidarity leaders who are now seeking change by talking with Polish government officials. `` KPN, Fighting Solidarity and other independence groups are treated by us as rival organizations,'' said <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Bujak </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> region of Solidarity. But <ORGANIZATION> KPN </ORGANIZATION> appeals to those who favor fighting Communists rather than supporting a strategy of negotiating changes with authorities. `` I was always engaged in the fight for a free <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>.

 Miss America <PERSON> Gretchen </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> is midway through her reign, but only one event so far has been less than enjoyable for the 22-year-old self-described overachiever from <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. She said Miss <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> pageant officials had set her up as the victim on a `` bloopers and blunders'' television show, an episode that forced her to ad-lib a description of a complicated satellite dish. `` It was the perfect joke for me _ an attempt to make me look stupid,'' she said. `` That's my biggest pet peeve _ making me look stupid.'' Her most memorable occasion so far was meeting President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in the Oval Office. `` He reminded me exactly of my grandfather _ I wanted to hug him,'' she said. As she discussed her reign at its halfway point, the <LOCATION> Anoka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, resident shivered and explained she is recovering from a cold. She was deliberately keeping a quiet schedule Wednesday until a <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> luncheon, where she had to play the violin. Such performances are a part of many functions, giving Miss <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> the opportunity to show off the talent that won her the crown. `` I would n't mind if the pageant got away from the crown,'' she said. `` Yes, it makes you immediately recognizable, but that's not the point. I'd rather have people know me from the inside rather than the outside.'' During the past six months, she has visited schools, conventions, nursing homes, ribbon cuttings, state pageants and endless events on behalf of the pageant sponsors. On a typical evening, she irons her outfit for the next day and writes back to admiring young girls and women who have asked for her photograph. After her reign, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> intends to complete her senior year at <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. She wants to go to law school, and to become `` a very successful corporate executive.'' She added, however, that she does n't consider herself a celebrity. `` I like the term ` role model,''' she said. `` The more approachable I am, the better.''

<HEAD>Banned from Easter Dancing, Norwegians Go Skiing Instead</HEAD>

 A 250-year-old ban on dancing during Easter may finally become a thing of the past. Authorities acknowledge the law sends few Norwegians to church for solemn prayer _ so many are on the slopes. Every Easter holiday, Norwegians abandon their cities and close their shops, jamming up mountain roads and ski trails. Few actually go to church. The dancing ban, made law in 1965, stems from strict 1735 decrees by the Lutheran Evangelical state church that limit public entertainment and sports events on religious holidays, said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Selaeg </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>. But he added: `` The rules get a little confusing and may be relaxed when the government finishes reviewing them next spring.'' Almost everything but church services and skiing is banned on Good Friday and Easter Sunday. Dancing is allowed Saturday until 9 p.m., though municipalities are empowered to override the rules or make them stricter. Similar blue laws and entertainment bans exist on Good Friday and Easter in <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, where the Lutheran church also is an arm of the state. <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s state-run liquor stores are closed until Tuesday, but restaurants can still serve alcohol over parts of the long weekend. At certain times, it's possible to buy a drink at a discotheque, though customers must keep their feet under the tables and off the dance floor. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> says 87.8 percent of Norwegians belong to the state church. In a recent newspaper survey, however, 14.3 percent of those asked said they would consider attending an Easter church service. About 75 percent of the 604 Norwegians surveyed said they no longer consider Easter a religious holiday, and would rather go skiing, said the <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION> newspaper Aftenposten. Some Norwegians say Easter has become more like a Viking spring festival than a Christian ritual. The Easter holiday has been five days long since the 1700s, but many Norwegians now begin the traditional exodus to the mountains the weekend before, drawing on their vacation time. The <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> says it's a myth that cities are totally abandoned. `` Only 25 percent of the population is on vacation,'' said a bureau official. However, the figure does not include people merely gone for the weekend, he added. With more than 1 million of their 4.2 million residents skiing in the mountains, relaxing in cabins by the fjords or flying off to sunny lands, a strange calm engulfs <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s largest cities during the last workdays before the holiday. City traffic jams disappear. Chronic parking shortages become parking space gluts. Skeleton office crews explain that nothing can be done `` because it's Easter.'' Among the few people left working by Wednesday afternoon were <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> personnel, foreign businessmen and thieves. Police say Easter brings a wave of burglaries, as thousands of people leave their homes vacant. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>' 8,000 volunteers, with blood hounds, helicopters and other equipment, staff 280 mountain posts to help skiers who get lost, exhausted or swept up in avalanches. For those left in the cities, the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> published a list of cafes and places of holiday entertainment. `` A city emptied by Easter can intensify the loneliness and isolation felt by those left in the lowlands,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> statement.

<TEXT>
 House Republicans gave new status to their most ardent Democrat-basher by electing <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> as their No. 2 leader, but they also put him on the firing line with the Democrats loaded up. `` I think it is manna from heaven,'' said <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Majority Whip <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif., who said Democrats would remind voters of the many controversial stands _ such as support for <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> cuts _ that the right-wing <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> lawmaker has taken over the years `` We're no longer talking about someone who is just another member of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> emerged from a closed meeting of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Republicans on Wednesday with an 87-85 victory over <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Madigan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> in the race to become <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> minority whip, the post made vacant when <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> became secretary of defense. His was a victory for those Republicans who, after 34 years of minority status in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, want more confrontation with the Democrats. The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> now holds just 174 of the 435 House seats. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> filed the complaint last year that launched an ethics committee investigation into <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>. And that was only the most notable salvo in a career of using television and the House rules to agitate against the majority party. After the vote, <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> insisted he also could work with the <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> as one would expect in his new leadership role, if they give him a chance. He walked across the aisle in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> chamber that divides the two parties and shook Democratic hands. `` I will be fair with anyone who will be fair with me,'' he told reporters. `` But I'll be ruthless on corruption,'' he said, insisting that he wo n't give up his fight against <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. Democrats said they hoped <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> was sincere about focusing on the vote-counting and other legislative tasks of the whip and would leave behind his longstanding tactics of disruption. But they were skeptical and wasted no time serving notice that <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> will feel the political heat. `` One of the prices on leadership is a certain moderation. Sometimes learning that is a costly lesson,'' said Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, D-Ark., took to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor to confront <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> had `` made his name'' with a `` personal attack on the good name of <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> said, because of allegations surrounding the speaker's book publishing royalties. Now questions are being raised this week about <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>'s financial arrangements surrounding a 1984 publishing deal of his own `` I think he should answer for all of the members of this House and for all of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people who have observed this action,'' <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> himself made the same point, but with subtly, in the unusual way in which he congratulated <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>. The speaker sent <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> a copy of his book, `` Reflections of a Public Man,'' and inscribed it: `` For <PERSON> Newt </PERSON>, who likes books too. Congratulations! And if you think a two-vote victory is thin, try it sometime with one, as I had to settle for in'76. To be chosen by your peers is a great honor,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said, referring to his first leadership race. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> signed and dated the inscription, and decorated it with a sketch of himself, bushy eyebrows and all, wielding a gavel overhead. While <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> telephoned <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> in a spirit of conciliation after the vote, he did n't call <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> did n't call him. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> also made clear that his spirit of conciliation was limited and not in the mold of <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, the Republican leader. `` All too often in the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and in the news media, bipartisanship means ... Republicans have to be passive and surrender while Democrats and liberals get what they want. That's nonsense,'' he said With that kind of aggressive stance, <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> could well be a unifying factor for the Democrats. Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Durbin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ill </LOCATION>., said if Republicans were looking for legislative accomplishments, they would have picked <PERSON> Madigan </PERSON>, the deputy whip and widely respected master of the legislative process `` They really missed the bet,'' he said. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> was `` fully predictable'' in his tactics, he said. `` Maybe he's trying to wear the robe of a statesman, but I do n't think that's going to work,'' he said Many Democrats said they did n't expect <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> to be much of a problem either way. `` Is a newt like a chameleon? Can they change and adapt to the environment?'' asked Rep. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N </LOCATION>. Either way, he said, `` We lived with the old <PERSON> Newt </PERSON>. We'll live with the new Newt.'' Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mo </LOCATION>., said he hoped for a new Newt, and in either case the answer would be known quickly `` I think you'll see very clearly which way it's going to go,'' he said. `` I do n't think it's going to be a secret.''

<HEAD>Pot Use During Pregnancy Linked With Stunted Babies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Pregnant women should be warned that smoking marijuana may stunt the growth of their unborn babies, and even a single joint results in prolonged fetal exposure to the drug, researchers reported today. `` This study documents that marijuana during pregnancy is associated with poor fetal growth,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuckerman </PERSON>, who directed the study. The research, based on 1,226 patients at a pregnancy clinic at <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, found that women who smoked pot produced babies who averaged three ounces lighter and two-tenths of an inch shorter than non-users' newborns. <PERSON> Zuckerman </PERSON> said the study underscores the belief that the effects of bad habits during pregnancy add up. While one may have a small impact on the baby, several together can significantly harm the child's growth. For instance, his study suggests that a woman who gains only 10 pounds during pregnancy, smokes a pack of cigarettes a day and uses marijuana and cocaine will produce a baby who is 15 ounces smaller than normal. `` It definitely supports the case that marijuana has an effect on the fetus,'' said <PERSON> Coryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a research psychologist at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, Md. The study also confirmed earlier reports showing that cocaine users also produce unusually small babies. <PERSON> Zuckerman </PERSON>'s study differs from earlier research, which has not shown a clear association between pot and fetal growth. Those studies were based solely on mother's admissions of drug use. His work, conducted with researchers from <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> and published in the New England Journal of Medicine, used urine tests to document whether pregnant women were taking drugs. The babies of drug-using women `` experience a double jeopardy,'' said <PERSON> Zuckerman </PERSON>. `` They experience biological vulnerability during pregnancy from these drugs,'' and after birth `` they are more likely to experience abuse and neglect because of their parents' use of drugs. They catch it both ways.'' The researchers speculated that the active chemical in marijuana may somehow slow fetal growth. Since the drug can remain in the bloodstream for a month, the study said, `` a single episode of marijuana use will lead to prolonged exposure of the fetus to the drug.'' Marijuana also raises carbon monoxide levels and cuts the amount of oxygen that reaches the fetus. Although cigarette smoking does the same thing, the damage from marijuana may be greater because pot users take bigger puffs and hold in the smoke longer. Twenty-seven percent of the women said in interviews or showed on urine tests that they had used marijuana, while 18 percent had used cocaine. When only urine test results were considered, 16 percent showed signs of marijuana and 9 percent of cocaine. The researchers said those who had drugs in their urine may have been the heaviest users. The researchers compared the babies of mothers with positive urine tests to those of women who had negative tests and also denied drug use. Those who used cocaine produced babies who were slightly smaller than the marijuana mothers', and their babies also had unusually small heads. The women studied were largely poor blacks and Hispanics. However, <PERSON> Zuckerman </PERSON> said their drug use may not have been much different from that of young pregnant women elsewhere. A nationwide study in 1985 found that 31 percent of women in their late teens and early 20s said they had used marijuana during the previous year.

<HEAD>Survey Finds 2.4 Billion Tons of Toxic Air Pollutants a Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal officials and environmental groups are calling for stronger laws to control toxic air pollutants in light of a government report showing that at least 2.4 billion pounds of deadly chemicals are released into the air each year. `` The magnitude of this problem far exceeds our worst fears,'' declared Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, D-Calif., after he made a report public Wednesday that provided the first nationwide glimpse into the volume of toxic pollutants released by chemical plants and other industrial sources The report covered 328 chemicals or chemical groups including 60 agents the government has identified as causing cancer. Among the chemicals are phosgene, used as a nerve gas in World War I, and methyl isocyanate, which killed more than 2,000 people in <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, in 1984. Spokesmen for the chemical industry, which accounted for about a third of the total volume of toxic pollutants cited in the report, said it is misleading to link the raw figures to health risk because they do not take into account actual exposure or concentration. They said the emissions are legal and take place within the restrictions of various state and federal permits. `` Anyone who says that there is a national health crisis based on these numbers is wrong. To use those numbers is misleading,'' insisted <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON>, chief spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on health and environment, acknowledged that the raw figures do not provide a clear picture of the health impact because `` we do n't really know how much of which pollutants individuals are actually breathing.'' Many of the chemicals on the list, however, have been linked to cancer, birth defects, reproductive dysfunctions, neurological disorders and genetic mutations, the congressman said. The report was compiled by the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> based on information from industry. While the figures, which reflected emissions from manufacturing facilities in 1987, were called staggering by some congressmen, environmentalists and government officials suggested they represent only a fraction _ perhaps no more than one-third _ of the toxic substances that actually leak into the air. The emission totals are based on reports only from large chemical manufacturers and others with emissions of at least 75,000 pounds a year. It does not include smaller polluters such as service stations, dry cleaners and petroleum tank farms. But <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON> and other congressmen said they hoped the preliminary government figures _ even though they may not present the entire picture _ will provide fuel for enactment of strong air quality legislation that includes provisions for regulating toxic air pollutants. How to deal with toxic emissions will be a focus of debate when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> rewrites the Clean Air Act later this year. Environmentalists also called for stronger legislation to deal with toxic emissions and <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Clay </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s top air quality official, told reporters `` some other approach is needed'' to deal with toxic air pollution. <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has been hamstrung because the law requires the agency to act on each chemical separately, a time consuming and expensive process when each action may face legal challenge. `` The idea of going down 320 -LRB- separate -RRB- rules.. is just too cumbersome,'' he said <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> said the report showed higher emissions than he had expected. `` It's a big number. I think it's a health problem that needs to be addressed,'' he said. Only seven of the substances included in the report are now regulated by the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, although a separate agency, the <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, has set standards within the workplace for more than 400 toxics including many on the list. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> called on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to enact legislation that would direct the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to establish health-based standards for all of the listed toxic pollutants, conduct emission audits and require polluters to put into place the best available emission control technology within five years. Of the 2.4 billion pounds of toxic emissions, the chemical industry accounted for 886.5 million pounds, followed by the primary metals, paper, transportation, rubber-plastics and fabricated metals industries each of which accounted for more than 100,000 pounds. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> led the nation with 229.9 million pounds of toxic emissions, followed by <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> all with more than 100 million pounds during 1987.

The 54-year-old actor and singer conceded: `` The test was n't winning the election The true test was getting the various groups to trust me ... but there is more confidence now because no one is questioning my motives anymore.'' <PERSON> Bono </PERSON>, criticized by those who called his mayoral bid an attempt to resuscitate a lagging show business career, cashed in on his celebrity status to promote tourism and secure corporate sponsors for events in the financially strapped oasis. It was the same kind of energy he used to help vault the pop duo <ORGANIZATION> Sonny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Cher </PERSON> to stardom in the 1960s. Eager to erase a $ 2.5 million budget deficit and transform <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> from a golf-happy retirement community into a chic international travel destination, <PERSON> Bono </PERSON>, who has kept a home in <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> for 17 years, works at least 60 hours a week at a job that pays $ 15,000 a year.

<HEAD>Saudi Arabia Growing Export Market for US Products</HEAD>

 If you're a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> barley farmer, a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> sheep producer or a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> tobacco grower, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has some reasons for keeping an eye on <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. Scores of other agricultural and food processing operations also are involved in the growing Saudi Arabian market, says <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural trade officer in <LOCATION> Jeddah </LOCATION>. Over the last five years, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> food imports averaged nearly $ 5 billion annually, up from $ 1.5 billion in 1977. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> says the growth has been fueled by `` the presence of thousands of European and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> expatriates and elaborate consumer food subsidies'' financed by <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s oil wealth. `` An influx of immigrant workers in the mid-1970s dramatically changed Saudi consumer spending patterns,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> writes in the April issue of AgExporter magazine. In 1987, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, which has a population of about 11 million, imported about 70 percent of its food. Tops in value were: barley, live sheep, tobacco, milk, poultry, meat, rice, spices, canned vegetables, fruit juices, fresh vegetables, sugar and corn. More than 10 percent of the agricultural imports are from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, making <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> the top cash customer in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm products. Consumer subsidies are used to distribute national income, derived almost entirely from petroleum, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. In 1987, oil accounted for 92 percent of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s total exports of $ 25 billion. Total imports were put at $ 19 billion, including $ 4.5 billion worth of agricultural products. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> share was about $ 486 million. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said the foreign influence has been felt deeply and has helped change <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> food-buying customs and diets. `` The <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> population rarely eats out,'' he said. `` The usual practice is to have parties at home. Even so, with a population of 4 million foreigners, the number and variety of restaurants have increased over the past few years.'' Besides many European, Lebanese, Chinese and other ethnic cuisines, fast-food places serving hamburgers, fruit juice, chicken, pizza and sandwiches are becoming more widespread. Competition for the thriving Saudi food business is also growing, with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interests vying with European, Asian and South American suppliers. `` The European Economic Community, in particular, places a high priority on expanding sales of farm products to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. `` It has used aggressive market development activities and a regular flow of trade delegations to widen its lead over the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in this market.'' <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, the world's leading barley importer, has been the target of fierce competition among the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In 1987, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> captured a third of the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> barley market with the help of subsidized sales under the department's Export Enhancement Program.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says private exporters have sold <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> an additional 400,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat at subsidized prices. <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>, general sales manager for the department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday the wheat was part of 2 million tons authorized Feb. 27 for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> under the Export Enhancement Program, or EEP Under EEP arrangements, private exporters can sell <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commodities at reduced prices in order to meet foreign competition in selected overseas markets and then collect free government surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies. The latest sale boosted the amount of wheat sold to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for 1988-89 delivery under <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> to about 8.2 million tons. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> said the latest sales were handled by <ORGANIZATION> Cargill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, 195,000 tons; <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dreyfus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, 50,000; <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, 30,000; <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, 85,000; and <ORGANIZATION> Richco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, 40,000. The wheat was sold for shipment in May and will carry an average subsidy rate of $ 19.94 per ton, or about 54 cents a bushel, he said. Slightly more than 1.2 million tons are still available under the current authorization. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels of wheat. The 400,000 tons would be about 14.7 million bushels and, at recent prices of about $ 4.16 per bushel, would have a farm value of around $ 61 million.

<HEAD>Banks Complain About Proposed Fines</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A trade association representing banks is accusing the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration of overkill in proposing civil fines up to $ 1 million a day for institutions that recklessly violate regulatory rules. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Yingling </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said the fines would be `` wholly disproportionate'' and would inhibit the ability of banks and savings institutions to attract quality managers and directors. `` We must guard against an overreaction that may harm innocent parties and fundamental rights,'' <PERSON> Yingling </PERSON> said in testimony prepared for delivery today to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on criminal justice. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is proposing a top fine of $ 25,000 a day for most violations but up to $ 1 million if the violation was made with reckless disregard for the safety of the institution. <PERSON> Yingling </PERSON> said the maximum penalty should be set at $ 2,500. He was appearing before the panel one day after the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' investigative agency, told the subcommittee that it had examined 26 insolvent savings and loans in eight states and found evidence of fraud or abusive insider dealing in each. Meanwhile, at a hearing Wednesday of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Banking subcommittee, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitley </PERSON>, acting associate attorney general, urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to maintain stiff penalties as a deterrent to financial fraud. `` Because most bankers are honorable people, one might think that modest sanctions are all that is required to enforce compliance with our laws: A slap on the wrist is all that a gentleman requires,'' <PERSON> Whitley </PERSON> said. `` The flaw in this rationale is that it is not the honorable bankers who have caused the massive problems we face today.'' <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> officials said the pattern of fraud and abuse among failed thrifts `` clearly is pervasive.'' `` The bulk of the losses are directly attributable to the failure by management of a minority of the industry to follow basic, prudent business practices,'' Assistant GAO Comptroller General <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said. He did not name the 26 <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls it examined. The Justice subcommittee's chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, complained that of the 11,000 S & amp; L cases the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> has referred to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in the last two years for criminal prosecution, fewer than 200 have resulted in convictions. <PERSON> Whitley </PERSON> told the Banking subcommittee that financial institution cases have overloaded the criminal justice system. A survey of <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> field offices showed more than 8,000 pending cases, half of them involving losses of $ 100,000 or more. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is proposing spending $ 50 million a year on discovering and prosecuting fraud at banks and S & amp; Ls. The money would pay for 760 investigators, auditors, attorneys and support staff, <PERSON> Whitley </PERSON> said. Rep. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the examination task force of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION>, warned of `` increasing shortages of experienced examiners. He noted that the creation of a multi-agency <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L task force with more than 1,200 examiners has left the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which regulates commercial banks, several hundred examiners under strength. Comptroller of the Currency <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON>, whose agency regulates nationally-chartered banks, told <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON> that he is having trouble hiring and retaining experienced examiners. Nearly 30 percent of the examination force consists of examiners with, on average, less than 3 years experience, he said, in a plea for authority to offer higher salaries. In another development, <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said his agency is working closely with the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to develop a plan to handle the billions of dollars in real estate the government will inherit from failed S & amp; Ls. But <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, who would be a member of the oversight board of the government entity set up to dispose of the real estate, declined to provide details of the plan to a House Banking subcommittee. Some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are worried that government `` dumping'' of <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L property at `` fire sale'' prices will ruin regional real estate markets, particularly in the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>. Treasury and White House officials are considering a proposal developed by <PERSON> R.T. </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamar </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> investment banker and a former deputy <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary, that would spend state and federal money to hold onto foreclosed real estate for as long as 10 or 15 years.

<HEAD>Housing Secretary Says Tax Incentives Needed to Make Zones Work</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Housing secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> says congressional inaction to create tax incentives is holding up designation of federal enterprise zones. `` President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is in favor of it. It's in the budget. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> is in favor of it. It's now up to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to move,'' he said Wednesday after his appearance before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Banking, <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> and Urban Affairs subcommitte on economic stabilization. `` In this case we're not looking for an appropriation, we're looking for a tax change ... I do n't want to make any announcements of zones ... until there's actually a tax change,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said. `` Let's not pass a bill that simply authorizes a zone but does n't do anything to put a dramatic change in that entrepreneurial climate.'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said reduction or abolishment of capital gains taxes, same-year tax deduction on up to $ 100,000 worth of investment and credits on employee income taxes for individuals and businesses located in the zones were needed. Neither the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> nor <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> tax committees has held or scheduled hearings to consider the proposed changes. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> received 270 applications for the designation before the January 17 deadline. Thirty-seven states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> have enacted local enterprise zone programs. The Housing and Community Development Act of 1987, as amended by the McKinney Homeless Assistance Act of 1988, authorizes the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> secretary to designate up to 100 federal enterprise zones, one-third of which must be located in rural areas. The zones are expected to encourage economic development and employment in previously depressed areas through tax incentives and reductions, improvements in public services, reductions in government bureaucracy and involvement of public and private agencies to provide jobs and job training. But a December 1988 study by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, found the program in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> `` did not stimulate local economic growth as measured by employment or strongly influence most employers' decisions about business location.'' <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> program was similar to many of the federal programs that had been proposed since 1980 when then-Republican congressman <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, first initiated legislation. `` I just do n't want to go through another eight years of getting these <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> studies of some zone some place that shows that nobody started a business because there were no incentives,'' said <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>. Whether successful or not, the program `` wo n't cost anything,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said. But <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> estimated more than $ 1 billion in lost tax revenues during the first three years of a program that involved 75 zones and $ 4.75 billion during the first six years of operation. The Bush 1990 budget estimates $ 1.05 billion in lost revenues over a four-year period.

 When a hospital computer catches a virus, the results can be hazardous to patients' health, a doctor says. In a letter in today's <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, a radiologist described what happened when computers used for analyzing patients' nuclear scans were infected with two computer viruses. Computer viruses are devious pieces of computer code that move from machine to machine, often reproduce themselves and sometimes make computers sick. Although this time the infection was cured without lasting harm, Dr. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Juni </PERSON> said potential damage was serious. `` The information on these machines was the actual scans we were using to make diagnoses,'' he said in an interview. `` If the data had been lost, it would have affected the diagnoses of patients.'' One of the viruses was relatively benign, making copies of itself while leaving other information in the computer alone. However, the other virus inserted itself into programs and directories of patient information and made the machines malfunction. <PERSON> Juni </PERSON>, of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Beaumont </PERSON> <PERSON> Hospitals </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Royal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, said about three-quarters of the programs stored in two Macintosh II personal computers were infected. He said he did not know the origin of the less harmful virus, but the more serious one apparently was on the hard disk of one of the computers when the hospital had bought it. A hard disk is the internal device used by computers to store programs and data. The virus spread from one computer to another when a doctor used a word processing program on both machines while writing a medical paper. <PERSON> Juni </PERSON> said the virus caused occasional random malfunctions. Sometimes the computers would freeze up or garble patients' names. The hospital had backup copies of patient records, and eventually purged the viruses from the computers. It has since instituted precautions in an effort to keep out viruses. <PERSON> Juni </PERSON> said the virus was on a hard disk manufactured by <ORGANIZATION> CMS </ORGANIZATION> Enhancements of <LOCATION> Tustin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> CMS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> said a virus was inadvertently put on 600 hard disks last October The virus had contaminated a program used to prepare the hard disks for use. It apparently got into the company's plant on a hard disk that had been returned for servicing. <PERSON> James </PERSON> said that of the 600 virus-tainted disks, 200 were shipped t dealers, and four were sold to customers. However, he said, the virus was `` as harmless as it's possible to be.'' It inserted a small piece of extra computer code on hard disks but did not reproduce or tamper with other material on the disk. He said he did not think <PERSON> Juni </PERSON>'s problems were caused by that virus.

 To Renaissance artist <PERSON> Leonardo </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Vinci </PERSON> _ and to many Christians since then _ <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>'s Last Supper was a formal, seated gathering at a rectangular table. But scholars at a Bible research center say diners in Christ's era more likely reclined on floor cushions for festive meals, as the <ORGANIZATION> Romans </ORGANIZATION> did in that day They also speculate that <PERSON> Judas </PERSON>, contrary to popular belief, may have had a place of honor at the last gathering of Christ and his apostles. `` Religious art normally pictures the period of the artist, not the period of the Bible,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> of the Biblical Resources Study Center. `` With apologies to <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Vinci </PERSON>, things probably looked different.'' During the Last Supper, commemorated Thursday by most of the world's Christians, <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> broke bread and blessed wine with his closest disciples hours before he was turned over by <PERSON> Judas </PERSON> to Roman soldiers and crucified. Relying on Bible verses, ancient Jewish writings and Roman historical works, <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> and his associates have concluded that the Last Supper probably was served at a low, U-shaped table that the <ORGANIZATION> Romans </ORGANIZATION> called a `` triclinium.'' `` Straw mattresses generally were placed around the outside, and guests ate _ and sometimes slept _ at the same place,'' <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> said. The 45-year-old U.S.-educated Bible scholar who has done research in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for 15 years noted the early Greek versions of the New Testament describe Last Supper participants as reclining. He said the Greek words `` anekaito'' and `` anepesen,'' used in <LOCATION> Matthew </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> and <PERSON> Luke </PERSON>, were often translated as `` sat'' but actually mean `` reclined.'' <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> agrees with other scholars that <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>'s Last Supper may have been a Passover dinner, held by <PERSON> Jews </PERSON> then as now to commemorate the exodus from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. Rabbis of the day urged followers to recline at this meal, in the style of the Romans who ruled the Holy Land in that era, <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> said. Today, Christian pilgrims visit the Cenacle, a building on <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zion </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> where tradition has it the Last Supper was held. <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>'s group has built a Pilgrims' Center on the southern edge of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> where visitors can share a Passover feast while reclining around a stone triclinium. The menu, which is as close as the center can get to a Passover meal in Christ's day, typically includes roast lamb, unleavened bread, wine, baked eggs, nuts, and fruits such as grapes and figs. In artistic renderings of the Last Supper, `` Judas generally is seated at one end of the dining table, the guy without the halo,'' said <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>. But the Biblical Study Center can cite verses from the gospels of <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON>, <PERSON> Luke </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> that indicate <PERSON> Judas </PERSON> was very close to <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>, probably to his immediate left. The most convincing is in the gospel of <PERSON> Mark </PERSON>, which alludes to the practice of sharing food from a common bowl. When the apostle <PERSON> John </PERSON>, at <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>'s right, asked who would betray him, <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> answered: `` It is one of the 12, one who is dipping bread into the dish with me.'' Christ likely would have shared the bowl with only one or two people, <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> said. `` In the end, what we're really trying to do is give people a better understanding of the Bible, of the world of Christ,'' he said. `` These are just clues that may help.''

 <PERSON> Yves </PERSON> <PERSON> Saint </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON> closed the winter ready-to-wear collections with a pithy statement of elegance. His show Wednesday was short and to the point, with beautiful no-nonsense daytime wear and a burst of colorful folklore for evening. This classic couturier no longer has to invent anything, as he has done it all. But his unmistakably Saint <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON> silhouette and color palette made good sense for women who want to look chic and sexy. Tailoring was easy, emphasizing softness, though the inimitable Saint <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON> sleeves under padded shoulders still gave shape to the outfits. At the end of the show Saint <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON> looked pale and hunched-over, his smile somewhat pained as he walked out and took a bow, kissing a model who wore a smooth and plain black jersey gown. Spokesmen for the designer say he is suffering only from fatigue. The short, knee-revealing or longer skirts were both split, modified versions of Saint <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON>'s theme last season. He wisely carries over ideas from his more expensive couture looks, translating them into clothes many more women can afford in ready-to-wear. The fluid charcoal or oxford gray capes over knickers or wrap skirts, worn with nailhead-studded belts, kicked off the show and set the relaxed tone. Lots of pants and wrapped skirt suits were in caviar tweeds, gray or flecked mustard yellow, with short, fitted jackets. No matter in what color of tweed, flannel or jersey, Saint <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON>'s pants were invariably fullish with pleats at the hips, and tailored to ankle length. Not all of the wrapped or split skirts looked comfortable, but they did n't look brazen, either. Saint <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON>'s ace in the hole was a sleek exercise in false modesty: a semi-fitted, black, midlength jersey dress piped in satin, with a line of big buttons marching down the front and up the sleeves. Black, black and more black came out in many tuxedo looks, first created by Saint <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON> in 1966. The elegant simplicity of all this was highlighted by an occasional jewel, like a rhinestone star at hip level where the skirt split. But when Saint <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON> got into color he did it in a big way, using shades of violet, prune and teal in one tuxedo outfit with soft jersey pants. While some fairly loud folklore prints have been seen in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> this week, Saint <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON> did n't pull his punches, and offered some of the most showy models in folklore-knit sweater suits with dazzling color combinations of yellow, gold and pink or green and turquoise. Although color combinations in cocktail dresses and pajama suits were shimmering with colors like flame red, shocking pink and fuchsia, the whole effect was as light as the softest caress. The handsome Turkish zouave idea for party time featured short velvet-calfskin jackets trimmed with arabesques of gold braid with satin blouses and easy gathered satin pants, sashed with a nailhead-studded belt _ all topped by a fez-type hat with nailheads. The beauty of all this was that any item could be worn separately with other clothes, especially if they are signed <ORGANIZATION> Yves </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Saint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laurent </ORGANIZATION>.

 A policeman and an unidentified gunman who had taken five persons hostage were killed Wednesday in a gun battle that reportedly began with the gunman trying to obtain cocaine. A second <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION> policeman was shot and seriously wounded and was undergoing surgery in nearby <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, police said. The incident began when the man entered a home in the city's north end Wednesday afternoon and held five persons hostage, according to police spokesman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilleary </PERSON> Police did not say what prompted the incident, but <ORGANIZATION> WUSA-TV </ORGANIZATION> reported the man entered the home, demanded crack cocaine, and threatened to kill the people there unless they supplied it. One neighbor, who declined to be identified, said the address was known in the neighborhood as a crack house. Police began negotiating with the gunman and the hostages were released one at a time, <PERSON> Hilleary </PERSON> said. The gunman eventually emerged from the backdoor, holding a shotgun to the head of a hostage and demanding that police drop their weapons.

<TEXT>
 The head of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> said the network would boost the quality of its programming next season because of viewer and advertiser concerns over the content of shows such as `` Nightingales.'' `` When we set the fall schedule, we can ... upgrade the quality of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> by carefully choosing what shows return and what -LRB- prospective new -RRB- shows we select,'' <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON> <PERSON> Tartikoff </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` We've beefed up broadcast standards. We are sensitive to changing audience tastes.'' The executive spoke at a preview for advertisers and advertising agencies of 32 prospective new programs for next season. The new offerings will include the return of `` M-A-S-H'' star <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Alda </PERSON> in a one-hour dramatic series, and a comedy created and produced by <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>. <PERSON> Tartikoff </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> was concerned about the `` content issue'' of its shows and the `` restlessness on the part of advertisers, affiliates and the audience.'' He did not name any specific program, but `` Nightingales'' has been criticized by nursing groups that claim it demeans the profession by showing scantily clad nurses. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said they would stop advertising on the show because of such complaints. <PERSON> Tartikoff </PERSON> acknowledged some advertisers had withdrawn from the show, but he said such pullouts were common and the show was doing well. `` Anytime you push the boundaries of what is acceptable, you're going to find that you sometimes push too far,'' <PERSON> Tartikoff </PERSON> told reporters Next season's prospective new offerings were highlighted by the return after a six-year absence of <PERSON> Alda </PERSON>, who played <PERSON> Hawkeye </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> and won five Emmys in 11 years on the smash comedy `` M-A-S-H.'' `` I have n't been tempted to get back into television until now,'' said <PERSON> Alda </PERSON> The actor will be involved in the creation and writing of the show, but he declined to say what it would be about except to say: `` We'll be very proud of it. We're very up about it.'' <PERSON> Tartikoff </PERSON> said the show probably would not debut until the middle of the 1989-90 season. The prospective programming continues to place a heavy emphasis on comedy, which has been largely responsible for making NBC No. 1 in the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> ratings. <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> will create and produce a series called `` The Nuthouse'' about a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> hotel, starring <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Korman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cloris </PERSON> <PERSON> Leachman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> Dangerfield </PERSON> will have cameo roles in `` Young <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON>,'' about a boy whose idol is the comic. Also among the shows previewed: _ <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Warden </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hope </PERSON> <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> will star in `` Knight and <PERSON> Daye </PERSON>,'' a comedy about two feuding former radio partners forced to reunite after a long separation. _ <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Jillian </PERSON> will star as a widow and mother of a teen-age girl who moves from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to start a new life. _ <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchum </PERSON> will play a homeless former merchant seaman who becomes a surrogate grandfather for four newly orphaned children in `` One Man's Family.''

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says religious faith and family togetherness are the best antidotes to the drug threat in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. During visits in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> with Amish and Mennonite leaders and young people, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wove much of his philosophy about proper lifestyles into discussions surrounding drug abuse. The president listened sympathetically Wednesday as Mennonite leader <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Burkholder </PERSON> wondered aloud whether his 4-year-old son would `` be able to say no, to maintain his values.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who traveled to southeastern <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> as part of his anti-drug campaign, called the religious and tradition-minded Amish and Mennonites of the area `` a shining example of what family and faith can do.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> reiterated his contention that prayer should be restored in public schools. He also said that while `` we want to preserve freedom of expression,'' he believes much of today's popular music has `` really bad lyrics.'' Sitting around a table in a classroom of an old, simple one-story Amish school, the president listened as his hosts talked of the increasing pressures brought to bear on young people. The Amish and Mennonite leaders told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that their relative success in child-rearing came from their deep-rooted family and religious values. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> marveled at how they had kept drugs away from their doorsteps. He told the Amish and <ORGANIZATION> Mennonite </ORGANIZATION> leaders to keep `` the moral underpinnings of your community, and hopefully others will see your example.'' After watching a karate demonstration by young boys and girls enrolled in a program in <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, aimed at keeping kids off drugs, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> chatted informally at length about the pressures on today's youth. `` They had drugs around when I was a little guy, but I hate to tell you how old I am,'' said the 64-year-old president. `` It was n't as much There was n't the pressure on kids in schools. It's just kind of come in more lately, you know.'' A few moments later he was asked: `` What do you do to keep drugs out of your life?'' `` Well, kind of getting along in my level of life here, the pressures are n't quite that big,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied. `` You do n't have a lot of guys coming up to you in daily life saying, ` Hey.' `` So I do n't have the temptations and the pressures that you've got, like young guys in school and all of that,'' he added `` But I think if I did, I'd try to do what you're doing _ I'd try to have that lifestyle going in such a way and helping the law enforcement so people would n't be tempted to offer up those narcotics.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> acknowledged to his young audience that, as president, he probably wo n't have an opportunity to test that approach personally. `` It would be pretty hard for some drug guy to come into the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and start offering it up, you know,'' he said.

<HEAD>Shortchanged Taxpayers May Apply for Refund</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Taxpayers whose 1985 federal refunds were shortchanged or lost because they forget to subtract taxes already withheld have only 25 days to file a claim with the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>. After April 15, the refunds will be lost forever. The <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday outlined a procedure for filing such refund claims, one day after acknowledging that an old policy had prohibited <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> employees from notifying taxpayers who neglected to take a credit for withheld taxes. The agency indicated that most people who got squeezed by the old policy probably were taxpayers who in 1985 received lump-sum pension payments from which some taxes were withheld. Most such payments were reported to the taxpayer and the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> on Form 1099R. `` Taxpayers should review their 1985 returns, especially if tax withholding was reported on a Form 1099,'' the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. `` If taxpayers find that they have not claimed all their withholding for 1985 they should file a special claim.'' The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> also announced that after additional review, it will issue instructions on how to apply for refunds that were not made for the same reason on returns filed in 1987. The new policy _ which Acting Commissioner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> says simply restates the basic <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> position that `` taxpayers pay only the tax due _ no more, no less'' _ affects returns filed in 1988 and later years. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> announced Tuesday night that <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> employees were no longer barred from informing taxpayers who forgot to consider withheld taxes when they calculated what they owed. The agency's hand was forced by several employees in the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memphis </ORGANIZATION> regional service center, who complained privately to Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Tenn., that the old policy amounted to stealing from taxpayers One of those employees, <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a returns examiner, went public with her complaints after talking to <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>. `` On a lot of returns, the taxpayer often failed to notice ... that money was withheld, especially from pensions,'' Ms. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> explained. `` A lot of times these taxpayers had paid someone else to do their returns. But when we questioned it, we were told that taxpayers would have to find their own mistakes.'' Ms. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said she personally handled dozens of such returns, on which taxpayers overpaid their taxes. In most cases, she said, the taxpayers were pensioners and the overpayment was between $ 100 and $ 1,000. A taxpayer's failure to subtract withheld taxes would likely be detected as part of the operation in which W-2 and 1099 forms from employers, banks and other payers are matched against income reported on a tax return. A computer will find, for example, that interest income was not reported where it should be on a return. Ms. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> or some other examiner would then try to determine whether the taxpayer reported it on the wrong line or the wrong form. If the examiner could not resolve the discrepancy, the taxpayer would be sent a letter demanding an explanation. To claim a refund of 1985 taxes because of the withholding problem, a taxpayer may file Form 1040X, Form 843, or a simple statement explaining the circumstances. In any case, the notation `` 1985 income tax withholding claim'' should be entered at the top of the page. If the taxpayer opts to file a statement explaining the claim, it must include the taxpayer's name, address and Social Security number; the withholding figure that was entered on the original return, the correct withholding and the refund due. The statement must be signed, dated and postmarked by April 15. Claims should be sent to the Problem Resolution Officer at the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> service center to which the 1988 tax return is being mailed.

 <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> is telling business it must help schools teach youth or end up paying the cost of remedial education for workers. `` You and I are spending more money teaching remedial mathematics to our employees than all the grade schools, high schools and colleges in the country are spending on mathematics instruction,'' <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> said in a speech Wednesday to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION>. `` I am getting more scared every day.'' <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Frye </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mathematics </ORGANIZATION> and director of curriculum development for the <LOCATION> Scottsdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, public schools, said she did not know how much was spent on teaching mathematics or where <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> got his estimate, but she had no reason to doubt it. `` That is an alarming statistic,'' she said. The council earlier this week released recommended standards to make sure students learn how to reason mathematically, knowing when to perform various mathematical operations, as well as just how to add, subtract, multiply, divide and do other calculations. <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> gave no source for his mathematics estimate, but said <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> spends $ 117 million a year on training, `` 10 percent of it on the three R's,'' elementary reading, writing and arithmetic. Business executives and parents must demand tougher educational standards, more effective expenditure of the $ 328 billion annually that the nation devotes to education and measures to strengthen the professionalism and status of teachers, <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> told his luncheon audience. `` In <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, teachers are on a pedestal, like they were when I was a kid growing up in <LOCATION> Allentown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, years ago,'' and Japanese teachers are among the highest-paid professionals in the country, <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> has had to reduce the difficulty of its training materials from ninth and 12th grade levels to sixth grade or below because a `` frightening'' number of workers could not read it, `` And sometimes even sixth grade is n't enough.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> wants a solid financial commitment from foreign countries before moving ahead with the $ 4.6 billion superconducting super collider, but the foreign countries want <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to take the first step. Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bevill </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations subcommittee on energy and water development, said Wednesday: `` They are going to have to put their name on the line. We like to talk in specific terms and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> likes to hear specific figures. I do n't like to be vague about it. But Energy Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said foreign countries are waiting for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> show its commitment to building the high-energy physics project in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> before they chip in. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> complained it's a `` chicken and egg situation this year'' and testified Wednesday that everyone `` is looking for the next person to make the next commitment.'' <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> is the only country that has signed a cost-sharing agreement and will provide $ 50 million. <PERSON> Bevill </PERSON>, D-Ala., countered there wo n't be much incentive for other countries to participate once the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> takes on the funding When <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> agreed to spend $ 100 million on the super collider last year, `` that's getting pretty serious, that's pretty committed,'' <PERSON> Bevill </PERSON> told <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>. Asking Congress to approve the project without knowing exactly how much is coming from non-federal sources is `` asking for trouble,'' <PERSON> Bevill </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is proposing $ 1.8 billion toward the cost come from non-federal sources, including $ 1 billion from the state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. But even <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> is not willing to begin spending its share if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is not committed to construction, and wants a refund clause in case the federal government backs out. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has proposed a $ 250 million appropriation for next fiscal year, including $ 160 million for construction. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> restricted last year's appropriation to research and development. The DOE has chosen a site around <LOCATION> Waxahachie </LOCATION> for the super collider, a 53-mile underground tunnel in which beams of protons would smash into each other with 20 times the energy of today's most powerful accelerators.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials are sorting through the views expressed in four hours of discussion with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> in which the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> was urged to ease tensions in Israeli-held territory. Assessing Wednesday's meeting in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> between <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Abed-Rabbo </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials were unable to draw any immediate conclusions. `` There was no definitive answer,'' said one official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said the two sides would have to analyze the four-hour discussion and meet again at a date to be determined. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> hopes the meeting will be a springboard to eventual peace talks and immediate `` confidence-building'' measures on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> where a Palestinian uprising helped propel the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> into dealing with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. `` The idea is to try to move toward dialogue and away from fighting with some practical steps,'' the official said. But, beyond that, `` the idea is to keep in mind there are ultimate goals.'' `` Basically, now is the time for considering each other's views for future discussion,'' the official added. In the meeting, <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON>, under instruction from <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, asked the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> not to stand in the way of <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> who might be willing to talk to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side stressed `` the need to get inhabitants on the ground involved'' in steps toward peace, the official said. <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON> made those points without going into much detail on the measures. But <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s aim is known to include an easing of the 15-month Palestinian rebellion in exchange for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s release of Arabs detained in the violence that has taken a death toll of more than 400 civilians. `` It's a two-way street in this respect,'' the official said. While <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> wants to begin the peace process in small steps, he has told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> his goal is a dialogue between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and Palestinians _ or the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, if that is the only `` meaningful'' form of negotiations. He also told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should trade land for peace `` as a solution to the problems in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> declines to negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and holds it responsible for continuing terrorist attacks against his country. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> will be here early next month for talks with <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Abed-Rabbo </PERSON>, the head of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> delegation, is second-in-command of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the Liberation of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>. The faction was accused by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> last month of sending guerrillas on an infiltration mission despite Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s renunciation of terrorism last December. The guerrillas were intercepted in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, across <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s border.

<HEAD>Antitrust Investigators Eyeing Delta-American Reservations Merger</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Antitrust investigators are looking into a planned merger of two airline-operated computer reservations systems that critics say will further decrease competition in commercial aviation. Officials of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> airlines said Wednesday they still hope to start the new system May 1, capturing a 44 percent share of the airline reservations market and reducing the number of companies in the field from five to four. The systems accept reservations for any airline, but critics say they tend to favor the airlines that own them. All existing systems are owned by major airlines. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which on Jan. 1 took over jurisdiction of airline industry mergers from the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, has sent out requests for information from both airlines and has issued several `` civil investigative demands'' to other companies that might be affected, according to <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials. Justice spokeswoman <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> confirmed that a civil investigation of the merger is under way, but said department rules prohibit disclosure of actions taken during the inquiry. Such investigations would ordinarily seek information from competitors and others that might have an interest in a merger, as well as the companies directly involved, she said. The combined American-Delta system would control 44 percent of the nation's airline reservations. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Sabre </ORGANIZATION> system is already the largest in the industry, handling about 35 percent of reservation business. <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>'s Datas II has about a 9 percent market share. The systems are leased by travel agents. The merger does not need federal approval, but the department has 30 days from the filing of an announcement to bring an antitrust case if it wants to stop the deal. Requests for additional information extend the deadline to 20 days after company response to the requests. Both American and <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> officials said they were putting together responses to several broad questions the department is asking. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lundy </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the companies still hope to meet the May 1 date for setting up the new reservations company. No name has yet been selected for the partnership, he said. Among those critical of the merger are some other airlines, state attorneys general and consumer advocates. Some say it threatens to reduce competition further among the dwindling number of major carriers. Several groups had written the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> urging an antitrust inquiry. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Witkowski </PERSON> of the Aviation Consumer Action Project, said in a letter that the industry is dominated by airlines that own interests in reservations systems. <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> spokesman, said, `` We are still very optimistic'' that the merger can take place on May 1. Under the proposed merger, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> is to pay American $ 650 million for a 50 percent share in the new company. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines without ownership in another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> reservations system will be allowed to buy shares at $ 20 million for a 1 percent interest. Other domestic and foreign carriers, as well as other travel-related companies, may buy in with approval of existing owners, but <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> and American will each retain at least a 25 percent share.

<HEAD>Repair Kits for Cargo Planes Are Defended Despite High Price</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> is defending its deal with a major defense contractor for $ 68 million in kits to repair crash damage to C-5 cargo aircraft despite overpriced parts and the ineffectiveness of the kit on a damaged plane. `` We in the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Logistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> remain firmly convinced that the decision to buy C-5 crash damage repair kits and the methodology of the acquisition for these kits is correct and appropriate,'' Major Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on oversight and investigations Wednesday. Testimony by <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officials and members of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> revealed that <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> proposed prices of $ 229.94 for a nickel-size washer and $ 211.13 for an inch-long aluminum shim that was an excess part from production of the C-5B. The part originally was valued at $ 22.09. `` It looks to me that no matter how we look at the matter, we're being taken and the taxpayers are being skinned here,'' said Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, chairman of the subcommittee <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> defended the price of the washer, saying: `` It's not a common washer. It's critical for the structure of the aircraft.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> based its need for the kits on two crashes and a lightning strike, according to the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>.

 There's nothing funny about a 5 percent jump in the cost of a good yuk, according to the man who compiles the annual Cost of Laughing Index. The tab for rubber chickens, <PERSON> Groucho </PERSON> <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> glasses, arrow-through-the-head novelties and copies of Mad magazine remained stable during the past year, but prices of some humorous singing telegrams have gone up 18 percent and admission to some comedy clubs has climbed, <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Kushner </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` This year's index has some good news and some bad news,'' said the attorney-turned-humor-consultant. `` The good news is rubber chicken prices have stabilized after jumping 23 percent between 1986 and 1988. The bad news is they're still too expensive to come home to roost. Rubber chickens cost $ 48 a dozen wholesale from a supplier in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state, and <PERSON> Groucho </PERSON> glasses run $ 12 a dozen, he said. <PERSON> Kushner </PERSON> said he's found an average 6.9 percent jump in comedy club admissions. While the Comic Strip in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is holding the line at $ 12, The Punch Line in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> went up $ 2 to $ 10, the Laugh Factory in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> added $ 2 to its $ 6 charge and the Holy City Zoo in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> went up $ 1 to $ 8, he said. Among other increases, the minimum fee for writing a television situation comedy went up 5 percent to $ 8,733 under the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> contract, <PERSON> Kushner </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>More Than 100 Nations Adopt Waste Shipment Pact</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY CZUCZKA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BASEL, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than 100 countries have endorsed a proposed <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> treaty that supporters say will slow the alarming and unregulated rise in toxic waste shipments across international borders. The treaty, immediately signed by 34 countries after its approval Wednesday, requires signatories to provide detailed information on intended toxic shipments and to ensure that importing nations can handle them in an `` environmentally sound'' way. Signers of the convention also pledge to forbid the shipment of hazardous wastes to countries that have banned their import. Waste generation and dumping in foreign countries are to be kept to a minimum, and developing countries are promised technical aid. Backers say the treaty is the first step toward restricting shipments of dangerous waste to nations unequipped to deal with it. But environmentalists contend it would merely legalize the transport of such materials. The treaty was adopted by delegates of 105 countries after a three-day U.N.-sponsored conference and 18 months of hard bargaining. It intends to confront growing international waste traffic and fears about poor countries accepting shipments in exchange for lucrative payments. Twenty countries must formally ratify it before it can go into force. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials have said this could take up to two years. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> were among major industrialized countries not signing immediately. Delegates were taking the text back for consideration by their governments. Among the countries that signed on Wednesday were <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and host <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> was the only Soviet bloc country to sign. None of the 40 African delegations signed the convention. <PERSON> Mostafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolba </PERSON>, chief of the sponsoring U.N. Environment Program, said African lands are committed to the treaty and he expects their signatures after a policy-setting summit meeting in June of the Organization of African Unity. Most waste traffic is between industrialized countries. But <PERSON> Tolba </PERSON> warned that movements between developing countries were on the verge of becoming a problem which `` God knows how we are going to control. `` Our agreement has not halted commerce in poison,'' <PERSON> Tolba </PERSON> said in prepared remarks. `` But it has signaled the international resolve to eliminate the menace hazardous wastes pose to the welfare of our shared environment and to the health of all the world's peoples.'' He urged all countries to ratify the convention quickly. The <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> environmental group said the text merely legalizes the international waste trade and was weakened to please industrialized countries. It again called for a complete ban on cross-border dangerous shipments. A total of 42 countries, more than half of them in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, have banned waste imports, <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> said. The convention does not explicitly cover shipments through a member's territorial waters, a point demanded earlier by many coastal states. Another contentious issue, liability for damage from wastes, was put off for further talks. delegate <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Winn </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> would oppose such talks. Under the treaty, individual nations can sign separate waste trade treaties with non-signers but they must offer at least as much environmental protection as the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> provisions. Final approval became possible after negotiators compromised Tuesday over Third World demands for tougher language, including greater responsibilities for waste-exporting countries and tighter compliance provisions. Among 16 Third World countries signing immediately were <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. The problem was highlighted last year when tons of toxic waste shipments from industrialized countries were found dumped in African nations and when waste-laden ships traveled from port to port seeking permission to unload.

 A former nuclear plant technician says he believes the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> paid him $ 4,000 to testify against the agency's No. 2 investigator only so it could quash evidence against other high-ranking officials. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> said Wednesday that he was giving the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> information about <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fortuna </PERSON>, the deputy director of the agency's <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigations </ORGANIZATION>, late last summer when <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> officials offered to pay him. He said the unsolicited and highly unusual offer came after he warned <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> officials that he would `` scream fire and foul play'' if the commission did not follow up on his alleged evidence of wrongdoing against <LOCATION> Fortuna </LOCATION> and other <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> officials. The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>'s contract with <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON>, under a section titled `` special terms and conditions,'' specifies that <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> `` may not discuss this contract or the information to be furnished the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> hereunder with any person.'' `` The effect of it was to gag me, to prevent me from going in front of the media,'' <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Smyrna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> claims the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> has done nothing with his information and only moved recently to fire Fortuna after <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> took his information to federal prosecutors in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> He said the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> is ignoring evidence he provided against other high-ranking commission officials, singling out <LOCATION> Fortuna </LOCATION> as a scapegoat. <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON> declined comment on <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON>'s accusations and other aspects of the <LOCATION> Fortuna </LOCATION> investigation, saying the case was ongoing The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> wants to fire Fortuna, citing his refusal to testify before a court reporter on allegations of misconduct originally leveled by <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON>. Rep. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Gejdenson </PERSON>, D-Conn., had provided The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> a copy of an <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> purchase order that authorized <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> to be paid $ 40 per hour for `` the 100 hours of effort estimated under this contract,'' plus $ 117 a day in expenses In a letter Wednesday to <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lando </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gejdenson </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., charged that the payment `` appears to be part of an ongoing effort by the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> to undermine the effectiveness and independence'' of the agency's Office of Investigations The Office of Investigations probes wrongdoing by plant operators. The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> is often accused by lawmakers and other critics of being too soft on the industry it is assigned to regulate. <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON>, 40, worked at the Nine Mile Point Unit I plant in <LOCATION> Scriba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, when he told <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> investigators in 1986 about alleged safety problems at the plant. <PERSON> Fortuna </PERSON> decided against pursuing the allegations, and federal prosecutors in <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, declined prosecution, according to <PERSON> Gejdenson </PERSON>. In August, <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> charged that <PERSON> Fortuna </PERSON> discussed `` sensitive and confidential <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> information and strategies concerning several OI investigations with unauthorized third parties'' and `` matters involving -LRB- <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> -RRB- with third parties,'' according to a partial transcript of his testimony from Sept. 12, 1988. One of the third parties was <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Comley </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> anti-nuclear activist.

 Hundreds of people demonstrated on behalf of popular reformer <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> and condemned what they call the perks and privileges of a corrupt <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> bureaucracy. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, who was ousted as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party boss last year because of his outspoken views, is running for a seat representing <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in the newly created Soviet legislature, the 2,250-seat <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>. A rally Wednesday on his behalf, the second in less than a week, was also a protest against the party elite. `` <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> is strongest in the struggle with bureaucracy and dishonesty in society,'' said <PERSON> Olga </PERSON> <PERSON> Ulitova </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> member for 27 years. `` He is the only one in 70 years of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> power who did not take the privileges offered by his high position.'' `` He struggles for the party, for a clean party!'' <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> worker <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Reptov </PERSON> shouted to the crowd. Several hundred <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> supporters gathered near a statue to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s medieval founder, <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolgoruky </PERSON>, across from city council headquarters. The crowd soon grew to about 5,000, many of them onlookers. Authorities did not grant permission for the demonstration, which came in the final days of campaigning before Sunday's elections. Busloads of police were present but did not try to stop it. Also Wednesday, members of the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> considered a new election for its delegates to the new legislature after a rebellion against old guard candidates gave new life to the candidacy of human rights activist <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>. The day before, more than 1,200 academy members approved just eight of a list of 23 candidates presented by its leadership. The academy has been alloted 20 seats and a new election must now be held to fill the 12 vacancies. A new slate of nominees is to be presented in two weeks, but it is not yet clear how they will be chosen. The previous selection process was widely criticized as undemocratic. `` This was a result of a great grassroots movement of the scientific intelligentsia. If they choose me to be a candidate and a deputy, I will not refuse,'' said <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, a physicist who won the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s first experiment with contested elections has spurred rare open debate and criticism of the government. Even <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said the Soviets were feeling their way toward democracy, and he said the present election law likely will be changed after the new legislature is seated. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said the new Soviet electoral law `` was passed a little too quickly without sufficient study of foreign legislatures.'' He made his comments to the <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diplomatic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, which he is visiting in part to make arrangements for a July trip by Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> also acknowledged that <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> has become an opposition symbol. He said that `` on listening to <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> you get the impression that his platform is not different from the party's. At the same time some of his ideas make you think he is deviating from the party line. `` Moreoever, those who want such a divorce -LRB- from the party -RRB- have rallied around him. He is on the way to becoming the symbol of the opposition. If it is not already the case, it's starting to happen.'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said he did not find a Sunday demonstration by several thousand <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> supporters in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> unusual in the context of a political campaign. `` The best means for public opinion or at least a part of it to express itself is to peacefully demonstrate,'' he said. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, who did not appear at Wednesday's rally, was <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party chief until his ouster in November 1987 for criticizing the slow pace of reforms and warning that a cult of personality could develop around <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. He has remained popular among Muscovites as he runs for the legislature against <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Brakov </PERSON>, director of the giant ZIL factory that produces limousines and household appliances. Both as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party leader and in his campaign, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> has lashed out at the privileges party and government officials receive. They include chauffeurs and access to special stores stocked with scare goods. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, which will meet only one day a year, is to elect the country's acting full-time legislature from among its membership and choose the Soviet president. A total of 750 seats in the congress are alloted to organizations like the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The rest are to be filled in Sunday's nationwide elections.

<TEXT>
 The government has appealed to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other western countries to reopen their embassies, saying the country has not become a `` bloodbath'' after the Soviet withdrawal as had been feared. A Foreign Ministry statement containing the appeal was read to foreign reporters on Wednesday. Ministry spokesman <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said it would be delivered to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and 11 other western nations closed their embassies in January and February as the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> completed its withdrawal after nine years of helping the Marxist <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> regime fight U.S.-supported Moslem guerrillas. The insurgents began fighting after a Communist coup in April 1978. Speaking to a group of about 20 foreign journalists, <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> repeated official allegations that closing the embassies was a propaganda maneuver designed to undermine the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government and boost guerrilla morale. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON>, whose remarks were translated by aides from <LOCATION> Dari </LOCATION> into English, said the embassies were closed `` on a pretext of insecurity and they were saying after the Soviet withdrawal, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> will change to a bloodbath. The last 40 days have demonstrated that this was not correct.'' The ministry statement specifically asked the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, as a guarantor of the U.N.-sponsored agreement under which the Soviets withdrew, to reopen its embassy. Remaining <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy staff members were evacuated Jan. 31 and the 11 other embassies also closed, including those of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Only 19 diplomatic missions have remained open in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> since the last Soviet soldiers left on Feb. 15. After the Soviets were gone, the insurgents launched a major offensive against government troops in <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, 75 miles east of the capital. <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> has come under rocket attack, but not to the extent of last year. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said 159 guerrillas, eight Afghan soldiers and 10 civilians had been killed in the battle for <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> in the previous 24 hours, but said he did not have total casualties in the fighting, which began March 6. Reports on official <ORGANIZATION> Kabul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> put the death toll since the battle began at more than 1,900, but guerrilla accounts of their own casualties usually are only about 10 percent of those claimed by <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. Residents of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> say government troops in the city have been firing Soviet-made Scud-B missiles toward <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> daily. The missiles have a range of at least 175 miles. Government officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the insurgents had fired at least 50,000 rockets at <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>. Huge Soviet Ilyushin-76 transports have landed with increasing frequency at <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s airport during the battle for <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, which is considered strategic because it is on the highway that connects <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and the Pakistani border. Staff members of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agencies said they counted 112 landings by the Ilyusihins last week and 109 by smaller Antonov-12s. When asked what the planes brought, <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said they were `` Aeroflot cargo planes carrying supplies from the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>.'' He said they were bringing part of the $ 600 million in food and medicine pledged by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to a $ 2 billion <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> relief program. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Reidmatten </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> aid representative in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, responded: `` We have not been informed about this'' and noted that all supplies intended for the program must be distribted through <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> offices. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Manson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> said he did not know what the Soviet aircraft were hauling.

<TEXT>
 Leaders of a Colombian drug cartel bribed Nicaraguan officials for use of a military base as a way station for 3,000 pounds of cocaine before smuggling it into this country, according to a federal indictment. Leaders of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel masterminded the slayings of the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> justice minister and a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug informant, according to the federal <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> indictment unsealed Wednesday. The indictment accuses 30 people, including an associate of the <LOCATION> Bahamian </LOCATION> prime minister, of participating in a ring that imported 22 tons of cocaine _ $ 1 billion worth _ into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` This is an encompassing indictment that talks about the whole system of importing cocaine from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> through the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> beginning in about 1974 and continuing into 1989,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Hook </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. Those indicted are tied to <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> drug kingpin who was convicted in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> last year of smuggling cocaine into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` This prosecution will further dismantle the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel and its distribution network in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Genzman </PERSON> said of the latest indictments. The cartel, named for the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> city where it is based, is considered the world's largest cocaine trafficking ring. It's said to be responsible for up to 80 percent of the cocaine imported into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The indictment accuses reputed cartel leader <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON> of organizing the 1984 assassination of Colombian Justice Minister <PERSON> Rodrigo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonilla </PERSON>. <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fabio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON> also directed the 1986 slaying of former <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> informant <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Seal </PERSON>, the indictment charges. After the minister's slaying, cartel leaders fled the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> country and eventually traveled to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, the indictment said. They stored 3,000 pounds of cocaine at <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brasiles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in the leftist-ruled country before flying it into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the indictment said. In May 1984, <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> and other cartel leaders arranged to pay Nicaraguan officials large sums of money to allow them to remain in the Central American nation and to use it as a base for smuggling cocaine to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the indictment said. In addition, in July 1984, a <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navajo </ORGANIZATION> owned by <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> was given to the Nicaraguan government as a gift, the indictment said. Also indicted was <PERSON> Everette </PERSON> <PERSON> Bannister </PERSON>, a close associate of Bahamian Prime Minister <PERSON> Lynden </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bannister </PERSON> was accused of taking money from the cartel to allow the island nation off <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s shores to be used as a way station for drug imports. <PERSON> Bannister </PERSON>'s telephone in <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> was busy during repeated calls from The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalis </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON>'s office, said the <LOCATION> Bahamian </LOCATION> government would have no comment on <PERSON> Bannister </PERSON>'s indictment <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, citing unidentified federal law enforcement officials, reported that an early draft of the indictment said <PERSON> Bannister </PERSON> shared the alleged payoffs with <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON> and other <LOCATION> Bahamian </LOCATION> officials. <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON>'s name was dropped from the indictment after it was reviewed by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> and State departments in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> said. The network did not say whether the early draft named <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON> as a defendant. <PERSON> Genzman </PERSON> refused to answer questions about continuing allegations that <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON> was involved. He did say that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has an extradition treaty with the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> and would seek <PERSON> Bannister </PERSON>'s extradition Other major figures indicted were reputed cartel kingpins <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>'s brother <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Mejia </PERSON>. Most of the cartel members were earlier indicted in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> but have not been arrested. Also indicted was <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, a pilot who is serving a 15-year prison sentence for his conviction with <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>. <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mejia </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> and the <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> brothers are accused of running a continuing criminal enterprise _ punishable by a maximum life sentence _ and conspiracy to import drugs. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>, an unindicted co-conspirator in the indictment, is serving a life sentence. Only five of those indicted were arrested: <PERSON> Yemel </PERSON> <PERSON> Nacel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, who is <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s former wife; <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Hyannis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, attorney; <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornhill </PERSON> and <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Podesto </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, authorities said. Last April, the <ORGANIZATION> Columbian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> negated a 1979 extradition treaty with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on a constitutional technicality. <PERSON> Genzman </PERSON> noted that it took the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government six years to get <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> to this country. `` I am confident that in some point in time we will be able to obtain custody of the others,'' he said.

<HEAD>Britain Wants Bill Right Of Rights For Hong Kong</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> is proposing a bill of rights for <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> to ensure civil liberties are protected there after <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> takes over the British colony in 1997. Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> proposed the idea on Wednesday during a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Questioned about prospects for human rights in light of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s suppression of recent nationalist demonstrations in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> noted that drafts of a new constitution for <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> have not yet addressed the issue out in detail He said despite <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s commitment to observe international conventions on human rights, `` it may be desirable to consolidate the -LRB- human rights -RRB- provisions of international covenants into a <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> Bill of Rights.'' <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> Governor Sir <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> told the committee that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> would ensure that <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> has a system of representative government but said its development would be gradual. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> plans to hold <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s first democratic elections in 1991. Asked if a bill of rights was planned, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said: `` It's certainly one of the things we'll want to look at'' in the final version of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s new constitution He said the proposed constitution calls for enforcing international covenants on human rights through the laws of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, ensuring that same rights and freedoms that now exist will be protected when the colony becomes a `` special administrative region'' of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1997. The committee was meeting for an update on the status of the 1984 Sino-British agreement that will transfer <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> to Chinese jurisdiction. A key part of its implementation is the drafting of the constitution, known as the Basic Law. A committee composed of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and Chinese members has completed a second draft of the law. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has promised that <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s capitalist system and lifestyle will remain unchanged for 50 years after the transfer of sovereignty. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> told the committee, which will visit <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> next month, that plans still are under way to have elections in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. `` There's no change of objective,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said, reiterating plans to have 10 members elected by universal suffrage to the <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in 1991 for three-year terms and an additional 15 to an enlarged council of 80 in 1995. Until now, the only elected members of the Council have been elected from limited groups. `` The whole process is one of steady and gradual evolution of representative government,'' he said.

 A 14-year-old girl is back home today after winning an age discrimination battle but says she ca n't forgive the elderly neighbors who forced her eviction from a mobile home community `` I'm glad to be home,'' <PERSON> Staci </PERSON> <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> said Wednesday after a judge allowed her to return to her parents' home in this rural central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> town. `` But my family was separated. I do n't care if the neighbors got down on their knees and apologized. I do n't think I could look them in the eye and forgive them. It hurt that much.'' Neighbors waged a court battle for more than a year to enforce a deed restriction on the <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON>'s property and other homes in the two-block subdivision. The deed banned children under age 15. They won an injunction in January, and <PERSON> Staci </PERSON> was kicked out of her family's home Jan. 31 after <ORGANIZATION> Pasco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Cobb </PERSON> threatened to jail her parents for contempt. The teen-ager went to live with a married brother several miles away, coming home to visit on weekends. But <PERSON> Cobb </PERSON> ruled Wednesday that the ban was rendered illegal by a federal housing law that took effect March 12. `` This court can not continue an injunction in violation of the law. The federal act now makes these deed restrictions unlawful and I'm going to dissolve the injunction,'' <PERSON> Cobb </PERSON> said at the end of a brief hearing. The federal housing law is controversial in many retirement communities, where some residents say they're entitled to live quietly and without children. All of the Elmers' neighbors who occupy the 16 other mobile homes in the small subdivision are retirees in their 60s, 70s and 80s. The long court battle left bitterness on both sides. `` I just feel we've been taken,'' said <PERSON> Arlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>, who lives across the street from <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON>. `` We bought here 20 years ago with the idea of peace and quiet. We raised our family. Our grandchildren are raised. `` It is n't that we are against children,'' she said. `` Out of 17 families, it comes down to the fact that 16 do n't have any rights _ I do n't think that's fair.'' `` I really do n't care if they like me or not,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON>, 45. `` There are some gray-haired monsters here.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON>, who sells real estate, admits she knew about the age restriction before buying the property, but liked the area because it was affordable and convenient to work and school. Other residents violated deed restrictions governing placement of clotheslines and propane tanks, she said, so she did n't think <PERSON> Staci </PERSON> would be a problem when the family moved in in November 1987. Neighbors said they were n't sure whether they would continue their fight. Most live on a pension and do n't have the funds for a long legal battle, and carrying on the dispute may be too stressful for those who are in frail health, Mrs. <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> said. Staci will turn 15 on April 7 and would be allowed to stay then anyway. Still, she said she was surprised by the judge's ruling and did n't think her battle had ended. `` For the most part I was shocked. I do n't think it's over _ maybe for the judicial system, but not for the neighborhood,'' she said.

<TEXT>
 As her former companion, <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, awaits sentencing in the death of their illegally adopted daughter, <PERSON> Hedda </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> is preparing to leave a psychiatric hospital and rebuild her life. Since November 1987, doctors have worked to repair physical and mental wounds she said she incurred during the 11 years she shared a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> apartment with <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, a disbarred lawyer. She underwent surgery for physical injuries and was kept for a time in a locked unit with the criminally insane. Now, `` she's about ready to go out on her own,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Klagsbrun </PERSON>, executive medical director of <ORGANIZATION> Four </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Winds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Westchester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where she has been living since March 1988. `` We're doing discharge planning for her now,'' he said. `` There are details to work out.'' The actual release could occur within a month, but <PERSON> Klagsbrun </PERSON> said she must still decide how to resume her life, including where she will live and what kind of job she wants. He said Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> was not available for an interview. `` Right now, release depends on the practical matters,'' said <PERSON> Klagsbrun </PERSON>. `` She has to look for some work to support herself, just like the rest of us.'' Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> had worked as a children's book editor, a job from which she was fired after repeatedly missing work. She has a $ 3.6 million civil lawsuit pending against <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>. At first, Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> was charged along with <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> in the beating death of 6-year-old <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> in November 1987. At the time, Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>'s lips were split and swollen, her broken nose had an ulcer on the bridge and a clump of hair appeared to have been snatched from her head. She was bruised and wounds on her legs were badly ulcerated and infected. She walked with a stoop and her hair was matted and gray. Charges against her were dropped when prosecutors determined she was too physically and mentally incapacitated to be responsible for the girl's death. Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, 46, testified under immunity as the star prosecution witness in <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s trial, during which defense attorneys contended she was responsible for <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s fatal beating. A jury convicted <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> in January of manslaughter, rejecting a murder charge because, as one juror said, Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> could have saved <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s life. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s sentencing is Friday. He could receive a maximum prison term of eight to 25 years. During the past year, Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> has undergone individual and group therapy, psychodrama therapy and what <PERSON> Klagsbrun </PERSON> called `` expressive therapy.'' `` She's done a lot of photography and artwork,'' he said. She will need to participate in outpatient support groups once she is released, <PERSON> Klagsbrun </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> was returning from a support group meeting March 13 when she received two traffic tickets _ for driving with an expired license and for failing to keep right. <PERSON> Klagsbrun </PERSON> said the license had expired because her mail had not been properly forwarded. The license was renewed the day after she was ticketed. She pleaded guilty and will be fined a maximum $ 100 next week. The <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> case focused national attention on domestic violence and the question of who should report cases of suspected child abuse. <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Segal </PERSON>, director of clinical services at Four Winds, testified at trial that Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>'s situation was like being a prisoner of war. She also likened it to the battered spouse syndrome, in which victims suffer `` an erosion of spirit, of will, of judgment.''

Although the market's key index suffered some setbacks as speculative investors sold issues for profit-taking in the afternoon session, the Nikkei maintained earlier gains as other participants traded a variety of issues, dealers said. `` The foreign exchange market that has been stabilized for the last couple of days and oil prices that do n't seem to be rising further were two encouraging factors for the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION>'s rise today,'' said a broker with a major securities firm in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. Trading was moderate with volume estimated at 800 million shares. Among the winners were steel and department store issues. In currency dealings, the dollar ended trading at 130.88 yen, down 0.52 yen from the previous day's 131.40-yen finish. The currency started trading lower at 130.73 yen and moved in a range of 130.60-130 .91 yen The dollar's lower start in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> followed a similar trend in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> overnight after comments by <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> and a government figure on factory orders for durable goods Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> factory orders for major durable goods fell 3.6 percent in February, the second consecutive monthly decline and the largest drop in seven months. Recent economic reports have indicated some softening of the economy in February. Retail sales, industrial production and orders for durable goods lasting for more than three years have all fallen. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, in response to a question at a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> hearing, said the conditions that led to interest rates in the high teens in the 1980s are not present today. `` It's our view that the actions we have taken to date probably have made interest rates, certainly in the long end of the market, significantly lower than they would have otherwise been,'' he said. An analyst with a commercial bank in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> said, `` The dollar-yen rate hardly moved after it marked 130.88 at the end of the morning session.'' He said trading became thin as a majority of participants stepped to the sidelines before the Easter holidays in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and European markets, in addition to a general lack of market incentives. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> market is closed for a three-day weekend starting Friday, while the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> market reopens on Tuesday.

 Two defectors from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> said today that there is little public resistance in their former country to the transfer of power from President <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON> to his son. The North Koreans, both students, were studying in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> when they defected on Feb. 13. `` All people in the north are brainwashed to believe that <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jong </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON>'s son -RRB- is a genius and they, therefore, think he must succeed to his father,'' one of the students, <PERSON> Cho </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung-kun </PERSON>, told a news conference. `` But I think <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jong </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> is a bum and most Czechoslovakians I have met said the succession problem shows that <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is not a communist nation, but a feudal state,'' he said. Other North Koreans have defected while traveling abroad but the defection of Cho, 22, and <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Un-chui </PERSON>, 23, was the first time North Korean students who had studied abroad have defected. Both had attended a medical college in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. North Korean official radio broadcasts confirmed the students' defection and said they were `` dopes who did not like to study. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON>, 76, has ruled <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> for four decades, building a personality cult that has virtually deified him in his country and maintaining strict isolationist policies. He has designated his eldest son as his successor, creating the world's first communist dynasty. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON> He became premier in 1948, commanded <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> forces in the 1950-53 Korean War and was named president in 1972. Cho, a son of a North Korean army colonel, said that after living in <LOCATION> Czecholovakia </LOCATION> for nearly two years he realized that leaders of the <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> government were lying to their people about the outside world, especially <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. `` In <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, we knew by publications that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is one of the fastest developing economies and is rich enough to hold the Olympics. This is quite contrary to what has been known in the north,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 The government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> is proposing a bill of rights for <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> to ensure civil liberties are protected there after <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> takes over the British colony in 1997. Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> proposed the idea on Wednesday during a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Questioned about prospects for human rights in light of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s suppression of recent nationalist demonstrations in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> noted that drafts of a new constitution for <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> have not yet addressed the issue out in detail He said despite <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s commitment to observe international conventions on human rights, `` it may be desirable to consolidate the -LRB- human rights -RRB- provisions of international covenants into a <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> Bill of Rights.'' <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> Governor Sir <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> told the committee that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> would ensure that <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> has a system of representative government but said its development would be gradual. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> plans to hold <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s first democratic elections in 1991. Asked if a bill of rights was planned, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said: `` It's certainly one of the things we'll want to look at'' in the final version of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s new constitution He said the proposed constitution calls for enforcing international covenants on human rights through the laws of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, ensuring that same rights and freedoms that now exist will be protected when the colony becomes a `` special administrative region'' of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1997. The committee was meeting for an update on the status of the 1984 Sino-British agreement that will transfer <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> to Chinese jurisdiction. A key part of its implementation is the drafting of the constitution, known as the Basic Law. A committee composed of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and Chinese members has completed a second draft of the law. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has promised that <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s capitalist system and lifestyle will remain unchanged for 50 years after the transfer of sovereignty. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> told the committee, which will visit <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> next month, that plans still are under way to have elections in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. `` There's no change of objective,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said, reiterating plans to have 10 members elected by universal suffrage to the <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in 1991 for three-year terms and an additional 15 to an enlarged council of 80 in 1995. Until now, the only elected members of the Council have been elected from limited groups. `` The whole process is one of steady and gradual evolution of representative government,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 Ten years after Three Mile Island, officials who faced the nation's largest nuclear emergency vividly recall a time of fear one says he'll never forget `` as long as I live.'' There was the fear on the faces of expectant mothers, evacuation plans in which two counties used the same bridge but in the opposite directions, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Signal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> building phone lines and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> trying to commandeer lead bricks from the military. `` You really do n't want to revisit this event. You hope you or anyone else never has to deal with it again,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>. `` This whole event was like a roller coaster. You did n't know when it was going to stop or when it was going to end.'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> was in his 72nd day as governor of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> on March 28, 1979, when the worst commercial nuclear accident in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history riveted world attention on a power plant 10 miles south of <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION>. At a reunion dinner Wednesday night, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> was host for those who faced what he said was `` something that had never happened before on the face of the earth, when the worst fear of modern man almost came to pass.'' The participants swapped stories about the lack of reliable information, the response of government and the complexity of making steam by splitting atoms in a nuclear reactor. `` If it goes wrong, there's no human capability of dealing with it. The bottom line is we were very lucky at Three Mile Island,'' said <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Eidenberg </PERSON>, an assistant to former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. Other White House staffers recalled the difficulty in getting accurate details about an accident in which a series of mechanical breakdowns and human error robbed the reactor of cooling water and released radioactivity into the air. `` What we really had to fear was what we did n't know,'' said <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathews </PERSON>, a staffer on <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. `` We were in the dark. We really did n't know what we were talking about.'' `` No one really knew what was going on,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, who was White House counsel at the time. At the peak of the crisis, when some federal officials were urging a general evacuation of residents, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> pleaded with <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> to `` send me one good man, somebody who can translate this foreign, technical information.'' That man was <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Denton </PERSON>, chief of operating reactors at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. He traveled by helicopter to the site and brought `` instant credibility,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. `` One of the things we learned was you ca n't manage a crisis from 100 miles away,'' <PERSON> Denton </PERSON> said. He called <ORGANIZATION> TMI </ORGANIZATION> and the accident at <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> `` a reminder of the downside of nuclear power if it's not successful.'' Two days after the accident, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> wrestled with the decision of having to order a general evacuation. After gleaning information from his staff between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m., he advised pregnant women and young children living within five miles of the plant to leave. `` I will never forget that hour as long as I live,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. Much of the dinner talk recalled fears about a hydrogen bubble that formed in the reactor. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilburn </PERSON>, former director of the state's office of management and budget, remembered a report about the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> saying the bubble was becoming potentially explosive. `` You could hear the sounds of the cars starting up and leaving the city,'' <PERSON> Wilburn </PERSON> said. Two dozen reporters stormed into the governor's office at that time and wanted to know if they should leave too. `` They were n't worried about reporting the story anymore They were worried about their own safety,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Critchlow </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s former press secretary. Former Lt. Gov. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Scranton </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, now a private businessman in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, recalled the optimistic statements from <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the plant's owner, which downplayed the seriousness of the near-catastrophe. `` I got this sinking feeling like a stone out of an airplane that this was bigger than any of us thought,'' <LOCATION> Scranton </LOCATION> said. No one from the utility was invited to the reunion.

<HEAD>Girl Cannot Be Forced To Take Genetic Tests To Prove Parentage, Court
Rules</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAKELAND, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A 10-year-old girl can not be forced to have genetic tests to determine her parentage just because a <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> couple says she is their natural daughter lost in a baby swap, an appeals court has ruled. The ruling Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Second </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeal </ORGANIZATION> here was a major setback in the legal battle <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> and <PERSON> Regina </PERSON> <PERSON> Twigg </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Langhorne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, are waging to prove the girl is their daughter. The Twiggs contend the girl was swapped in the hospital days after her birth for a sickly child who later died. But the court ruled that genetic testing of the <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION> girl, <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> <PERSON> Mays </PERSON>, would deny her `` privacy and freedom from unjustified humiliation and psychological damage.'' `` They ruled with me every which way,'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON>, attorney for <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> and the father who raised her, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mays </PERSON>. `` I'm thrilled about it.'' <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> was also happy with the decision, <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON> said. But the Twiggs' attorney, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Blakely </PERSON>, said: `` The court seems to have totally ignored the anguish that Mr. and Mrs. <PERSON> Twigg </PERSON> have, knowing they have a child somewhere in the world that they have never seen.'' <PERSON> Blakely </PERSON> said he plans to ask the full panel of judges to reconsider the opinion. If they refuse, he plans to take the case to the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. If Wednesday's ruling holds, the <PERSON> Twiggs </PERSON> will have to file a new motion explaining why they want to know if <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> is their daughter. And their reason can not be `` merely to satisfy their curiosity,'' according to the appeals court ruling. Attorneys for boths sides agreed that the Twiggs' next step would be to seek custody of <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON>, or the right to visit the girl. If the court rules that the Twiggs do n't have those rights, the question of genetic tests would become irrelevant. `` Admittedly, natural parents have certain presumptive rights of custody as to their offspring,'' the court said. `` Those rights, however, are not absolute. Children are not property, but individuals whose needs and physical and mental well-being find protection in the law.'' <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON> filed testimony from mental health experts who said <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> would be severely disturbed if she were forced to visit the Twiggs or undergo genetic tests. The ruling is the latest twist in a case which began more than a decade ago in <ORGANIZATION> Hardee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. The girl the Twiggs brought home from the hospital, <PERSON> Arlena </PERSON>, died of a congenital heart condition last summer, and the couple now believes <PERSON> Arlena </PERSON> was actually the child of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Mays </PERSON>, who died seven years ago. Blood tests performed before <PERSON> Arlena </PERSON> died proved she could not have been the Twiggs' biological daughter. Last fall, <PERSON> Blakely </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Twiggs </PERSON> would seek custody of <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON>, in part because they believed <PERSON> Mays </PERSON> had participated in the baby swap. But recently they softened their position, saying they would like to get to know <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> but would n't seek to take her away from the only father she has ever known.

<TEXT>
 The students of the <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> for Amish and Mennonite children spent their recess soaking up the spring sun and talking about the important man who had just stopped by. `` He looked different than in the pictures,'' said <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Reiff </PERSON>, a third-grader at the two-room schoolhouse, shortly after President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his entourage went bounding back down the winding, country roads of southeastern <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> to their next destination. `` He looked a little older,'' <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> added, as some of his many cousins with the same last name nodded. Wearing a blue windbreaker, dark blue pants and a short-brimmed hat with a scoop in the middle, <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> and his classmates said they would have to watch neighbors' televisions Wednesday evening to see if they made the national news. Their Amish beliefs forbid them from owning television sets or radios. `` When he came into the room, I could n't believe my eyes,'' said <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Reiff </PERSON>, a fourth-grader. Both boys spoke with <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Dutch accents. Some of the boys said they would like to be president one day, but conceded that their futures would probably be linked to family farms since their beliefs also prevent them from holding public office. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke briefly with the school's 55 children in first through eighth grades and then met with about a dozen <LOCATION> Amish </LOCATION> and Mennonite leaders for about 30 minutes. The president chatted with the students about his dog's puppies, his trip to <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, and how his large staff of <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents keeps him safe. The children said he mentioned nothing of the only thing he had talked about before and after his meeting with them: the nation's drug problem Earlier in the day, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke to about 3,500 students and guests in the stuffed-to-capacity <ORGANIZATION> Conestoga </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> gymnasium. After leaving the Amish school, he traveled to <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, to meet with community organizations fighting drug abuse. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, an Old Order Mennonite minister, stood in stark contrast to the giggling, red-cheeked schoolchildren when he discussed the meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Amish historians believe the meeting could be the first with a sitting president and members of their community, which is more traditional than the Mennonite sect, from which it separated in the 17th century. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, 57, a farmer by profession, said the leaders told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> their strong family ties and emphasis on religion helped keep children and teen-agers away from drugs. But, he added, the Amish and Mennonite communities are not perfect. `` We realize we are just human like everybody else and we do n't want to forget that,'' he said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said the president shook hands with each of them and even remembered his first name when saying goodbye. `` He was a down-to-earth president,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Burkholder </PERSON>, 44, a father of three of the children who attend <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> <PERSON> Johns </PERSON>, said he was nervous talking with the nation's chief executive, but overcame the jitters when he `` kept on talking. <PERSON> Burkholder </PERSON> said he told the president of how his two sons, ages 18 and 22, had been offered drugs. `` The children are taught values from the parents and those are passed on,'' he said. `` I was thankful that my sons were able to withstand the temptation.'' The president, accompanied at the meeting by Attorney General and former <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s drug control policy director, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, told the leaders their community, `` is a shining example of what family and faith can do.''

 Lawyers for three white students did n't prove they were discriminated against when <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> suspended them after a confrontation with a black professor, said a judge who dismissed the case <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Shane </PERSON> <PERSON> Devine </PERSON> concluded the students were `` not entitled to relief under any set of facts they could prove.'' <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON>, an attorney for <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday the ruling vindicated his claim the lawsuit was `` a public relations stunt.'' A companion lawsuit is pending in a state court, however, and one of the students' lawyers said Wednesday that the real action will be there. `` The focus of our efforts ... has always been the First Amendment -LRB- free-speech -RRB- claim in the state court,'' said <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruegger </PERSON>. `` We're looking forward to a trial in front of a jury on those claims.''

Defenders call it a courageous bastion of conservatism and traditional values persecuted by a liberal campus. At issue in the lawsuits was a February 1988 classroom confrontation between the three and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, a black music professor described by a Review article as part of `` <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION>'s Dynamic Duo of Mediocrity. Though the students accused Cole of grabbing Quilhot by the arm and breaking the flash on his camera during the angry encounter, a campus disciplinary board found them guilty of harassing him, and they were suspended. Shortly before the March 1988 suspensions, <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON> spoke at a rally held during the furor triggered by the incident. `` I feel dreadful about the attack on Professor Cole,'' <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON> said. `` I do not want one minority or woman student to decline to come to <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> because of the perception that this incident is representative of the true <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION>. It is not.'' In a ruling issued Tuesday, <PERSON> Devine </PERSON> rejected the students' claim that those comments and others demonstrated <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON>'s bias against them. Though it could be inferred that <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON> believed the students acted on racial motives in confronting Cole, `` it is not reasonable to infer that President <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON>'s motives in making his comments were racial ... that the plaintiffs' race was the reason for his actions,'' <PERSON> Devine </PERSON> said. Another of the students' lawyers, <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, said the students may appeal or ask the judge to reconsider. <PERSON> Devine </PERSON> noted that state <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohl </PERSON> ruled in January that he found `` no persuasive evidence'' to support the students' political discrimination claim. In that ruling, <PERSON> Mohl </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sutter </PERSON> reinstated because one member of the panel that disciplined them had been biased against the Review. <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> could have renewed disciplinary action against them, but did not, and they returned to campus soon afterward. Quilhot already had completed his six-month suspension. <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Huppe </PERSON> said all three were off campus Wednesday for semester break.

 About 130 Vietnamese boat people apparently drowned after a Japanese tanker collided with their overloaded 30-foot boat in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, Japanese officials reported today. Authorities said first reports of the March 8 accident did not emerge until Monday, when 35 survivors of the accident on the high seas between <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> arrived in the port of <LOCATION> Yokohama </LOCATION>. The refugees said their wooden ship was carrying 165 people when it struck the propeller of the 239,000-ton Japanese tanker Nissei-Maru, said <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION> refugee center official <PERSON> Masanami </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakatsukasa </PERSON>. The boat had left Long An in southern <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> on March 4, he said. <PERSON> Nakatsukasa </PERSON> quoted the survivors as saying their boat overturned and sank after it hit the propeller of the tanker while trying to approach the Japanese ship for help. Many passengers were seasick and suffering from a lack of fresh water after four days at sea, <PERSON> Nakatsukasa </PERSON> quoted them as saying. The refugee boat somehow overturned when the tanker's captain, <PERSON> Yasuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kawamura </PERSON>, stopped his ship and prepared ladders to let the refugees come on board, said <PERSON> Hiroshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hattori </PERSON>, spokesman of <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tanker </ORGANIZATION>, the <PERSON> Nissei-Maru </PERSON>'s agent. <PERSON> Hattori </PERSON> denied reports that the boat overturned after hitting the tanker's propeller. The Nissei-Maru crew conducted an all-day search and rescued 35 refugees, then sailed for <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, where the refugees were refused entry, news reports said. The refugees then were brought to <LOCATION> Yokohama </LOCATION> on another Japanese vessel after the <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s government granted them entry, said <PERSON> Chikako </PERSON> <PERSON> Saito </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> High Commissioner for Refugees in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. The 35 survivors will stay in the <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION> refugee center until the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> High Commissioner representative interviews them, arranges for health check-ups, and decides on possible resettlement elsewhere, <PERSON> Nakatuskasa </PERSON> said. The Maritime Safety Agency said officials would be sent to the <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION> refugee center to investigate the accident. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Taizo </PERSON> <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON> said his ministry viewed the case as `` a really serious issue,'' but could not comment until the <ORGANIZATION> MSA </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s coast guard, completed its investigation.

<HEAD>Legislative Committee in W.Va. Recommends Impeaching State Treasurer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK PAXTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has overwhelmingly recommended that the state treasurer be impeached for his role in the loss of $ 279 million from the consolidated investment fund. The legislative committee voted 19-6 Wednesday night to recommend Treasurer <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON>'s impeachment. <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> said one more formal vote is needed before the impeachment resolution can be sent to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delegates </ORGANIZATION> floor. He gave no timetable for that vote or a related decision on whether to reprimand state Auditor <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gainer </PERSON>. If 51 of the 100 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members vote to impeach <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON>, the popular two-term Democrat will be tried in the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where two-thirds approval of the 34 members is needed to remove him from office. The resolution accuses <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON> of neglect of duty, incompetence, maladministration and high crimes and misdemeanors for either failing to report the losses, the bulk of which occurred from April to June 1987, or for failing to supervise his staff. <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON> blames his employees, primarily former Associate Treasurer <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Margolin </PERSON> and former Investment Director <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lester </PERSON>, for the losses. He says he did n't learn of them until December 1988. <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON> was not in his office when the committee voted and a person who answered his home telephone Wednesday evening said he was not home. Shortly before the committee voted, however, <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON>, 61, appeared on a television newscast in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>. `` I've been in public service for 41 years,'' he said. `` Neglect of duty? I would n't know how to neglect duty. I work constantly.'' After endorsing the impeachment, committee members voted to have their staff lawyers draft a resolution reprimanding or publicly censuring Gainer. Some committee members were upset when <PERSON> Gainer </PERSON> testified last week that he delegated many of his duties to his top aide, <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, and did not take an active interest in Board of Investment activities. That board, made up of the treasurer, auditor and governor, sets general policies for the investment fund, and the treasurer's office takes charge of day-to-day investments. `` He did n't seem to know anything,'' said Delegate <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Roop </PERSON>. `` The Legislature in its wisdom did not put him on the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investments </ORGANIZATION> to be a potted plant,' said Delegate <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Staton </PERSON>. The committee spent more than three hours over two days on a line-by-line review of the impeachment resolution but engaged in no debate before the vote. It defeated most attempts to weaken or make major modifications to the impeachment resolution Wednesday but agreed to delete allegations that <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON> or his staff solicited treasurer's office employees for campaign contributions, which would violate state law. `` If you impeached every elected officer whose subordinates solicited campaign contributions, you'd have to impeach every elected official who ever served in the state of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>,'' said Delegate <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. The committee also eliminated an allegation that <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Margolin </PERSON> to solicit funds from brokers with which the state did business. `` I think it amounts to an attempted extortion,'' said Delegate <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Grubb </PERSON>, who fought to retain the solicitation allegations. Other committee members said no evidence existed that <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON> knew about or condoned the solicitation of his employees or that his request of <PERSON> Margolin </PERSON> to seek funds from the brokers broke any laws. `` Let's not throw up a bunch of mud on the wall and see what sticks,'' <PERSON> Staton </PERSON> said.

 A young woman whose presence provides a vivid reminder of the long, sometimes violent struggle for Puerto Rican independence sat quietly at the defense table during the <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> <PERSON> Fargo </PERSON> robbery trial. Her grandfather, <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Collazo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, was convicted of trying to assassinate President <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> nearly 40 years ago in a crime carried out in the name of Puerto Rican independence. `` It's more like a personal interest, since I grew up in the independence movement,'' <PERSON> Loarina </PERSON> <PERSON> DeJesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Collazo </PERSON>, 23, said Wednesday during a break in closing arguments. `` It's history and, politically speaking, it's pretty exciting.'' The government claims that the $ 7.1 million <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> robbery was carried out by <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Macheteros </LOCATION>, a violent Puerto Rican independence group, to finance its revolutionary activities. In closing arguments Wednesday, <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinglass </PERSON>, defense attorney for the man accused of masterminding the robbery, said his client knew beforehand about the 1983 robbery, received the money after the crime and helped the robber escape. But <PERSON> Weinglass </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury that the government failed to offer any physical evidence or testimony to prove that his client, <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Segarra </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, was responsible for the robbery itself. `` He knew what was going to occur. He wanted the robbery to succeed, but he was not there and the government has not proven he took steps to help it succeed,'' <PERSON> Weinglass </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Segarra </PERSON> and four other men have been on trial since Oct. 11 on charges stemming from the robbery. <PERSON> Segarra </PERSON> faces 150 years in prison if convicted on all 16 counts against him. For her part, <PERSON> DeJesus </PERSON> volunteered to come to <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> in May to work as an interpreter and legal aide to the attorney representing another defendant, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayes </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON>, who is accused of using $ 20,000 from the 1983 robbery to finance a toy giveaway in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> as a publicity stunt for the group. Her grandfather was 36 on Nov. 1, 1950, when he and another nationalist, <PERSON> Griselio </PERSON> <PERSON> Torresola </PERSON>, tried to shot their way into <ORGANIZATION> Blair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, where <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> was staying while the White House was being renovated. <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> was uninjured, but <PERSON> Collazo </PERSON>'s companion and a White House guard were killed. <PERSON> Collazo </PERSON> was sentenced to die in the electric chair, but <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> commuted his sentence to life in prison in 1952. President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> granted <PERSON> Collazo </PERSON> clemency in 1979 with three other Puerto Rican nationalists convicted in a 1954 shooting attack on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> House of Representatives. Five congressmen were wounded in the attack. <PERSON> Collazo </PERSON>, now 75, was freed from federal prison at <LOCATION> Leavenworth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, and is living with his daughter in <LOCATION> Vega </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. `` Surely I am proud of her,'' <PERSON> Collazo </PERSON> said of his granddaughter in a telephone interview. He said he saw no similarity between what he did and what she is doing except `` for the fact that we are fighting for the same cause.'' `` I was -LRB- involved -RRB- in a violent action. This case is more a political action than violent action,'' he said. <PERSON> DeJesus </PERSON>, who attended <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Univerity </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for one year as a psychology major, said she may remain in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> after the current trial ends to assist in the defense of nine other <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> <PERSON> Fargo </PERSON> defendants still awaiting trial. `` I consider it totally political,'' she said of the trial. `` They did it with political and ideological purposes _ if it's true that they did it.''

<TEXT>
 A tribal court has issued a temporary order prohibiting <ORGANIZATION> Navajo </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> from exercising his authority and barring him from his offices. Navajo District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazzie </PERSON>'s order late Wednesday told <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> and 27 others not to enter or stay in tribal offices `` except for the purpose of removing personal belongings, unless further authorized by this court.'' <PERSON> Yazzie </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> and the others to appear before Friday to show why the order should not be extended indefinitely. Among the 27 named in the order were Vice Chairman <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, press secretary <PERSON> Tazbah </PERSON> <PERSON> McCullah </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Tome </PERSON>, director of Navajo public safety. `` I feel a sense of relief,'' said interim tribal chairman <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Haskie </PERSON>, who was appointed by the <ORGANIZATION> Tribal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> majority two weeks ago. `` This has been a lengthy and exhausting process.'' Majority council members, meanwhile, filed a lawsuit Wednesday asking for a permanent injunction against the chairman. Tribal offices were closed late Wednesday, and <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> could not be reached for immediate comment on whether he would obey the order, which came in response to a motion filed by the council majority. The council placed <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> on paid administrative leave last month following <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> testimony linking him to alleged graft. <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> contends the council action was illegal and has refused to leave. He has continued to use his office and has changed the locks on the <ORGANIZATION> Tribal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> chambers. <PERSON> Yazzie </PERSON>'s order banned <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> from using tribal funds or equipment, including airplanes, and from issuing tribal directives or making contracts. <PERSON> Haskie </PERSON> said he was confident tribal police would enforce the order. Council delegates noted that police are funded by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, which has requested that they not take sides in the dispute. However, Tome, head of the police, has been one of <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>'s staunchest allies, and police disregarded <PERSON> Yazzie </PERSON>'s order last year prohibiting closure of the <ORGANIZATION> Navajo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scholarship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> headed by <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> rival <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> <PERSON> Zah </PERSON> Police closed off the building and changed the locks.

<TEXT>
 A sheriff says he must have been living on borrowed time for more than 12 years while his predecessor and three others plotted to kill him. <PERSON> Cyrus </PERSON> `` <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Tardo </PERSON>, a former Lafourche Parish sheriff, and three others pleaded guilty Wednesday to planting the homemade bomb that nearly killed Sheriff <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON> last December. `` It looked like I lived a little bit longer than I thought I was going to live,'' said the 60-year-old <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON>, who is still on crutches. `` It was really surprising to hear what went on in the courtroom today, the testimony that these people gave themselves.'' Federal prosecutors said the scheme was fueled by political rivalry, revenge and dreams of unfettered drug trafficking in the coastal parish, or county, about 40 miles southwest of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. Federal prosecutor <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> <PERSON> Africk </PERSON> said the scheme began in 1976 when <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON> defeated Tardo for sheriff and culminated with the remote-control detonation of a pipe bomb in the <ORGANIZATION> Thibodaux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> parking lot on Dec. 15, 1988. <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON>'s left foot was maimed. A part-time deputy was injured in the blast. The four who pleaded guilty were <PERSON> Tardo </PERSON>, 58; <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> McClendon </PERSON>, 42; <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergeron </PERSON>, 42; and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tullier </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 23. They were accused of conspiracy, possession of an unregistered destructive device and damaging a law enforcement vehicle. <PERSON> Tardo </PERSON> also pleaded guilty to soliciting to commit a violent crime. Sentencing was set for May 31. Tardo faces a maximum of 45 years in prison and $ 1 million in fines. <PERSON> Tullier </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bergeron </PERSON> and <PERSON> McClendon </PERSON> each face a maximum of 35 years in prison and $ 750,000 in fines. Tardo, <PERSON> McClendon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tullier </PERSON> also face state charges of attempted murder. Authorities said attempted murder charges against <PERSON> Bergeron </PERSON> had been dropped in exchange for his cooperation. In 1979, <PERSON> Tardo </PERSON> made an unsuccessful attempt to unseat <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON>, and discussed again having the sheriff killed, <PERSON> Africk </PERSON> said. `` Tardo's motivation to kill <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON> grew through this time period. <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON> was <PERSON> Tardo </PERSON>'s political enemy and <PERSON> Tardo </PERSON> blamed <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON> for personal and employment-related failures he suffered,'' <PERSON> Africk </PERSON> said. In 1984, <PERSON> Tardo </PERSON> became president of the parish but he was not re-elected in 1987. It was then, <PERSON> Africk </PERSON> said, that <PERSON> Tardo </PERSON> and <PERSON> McClendon </PERSON>, a former police officer in <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, decided to kill <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON> with a bomb. <PERSON> McClendon </PERSON> enlisted the help of <PERSON> Bergeron </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Houma </LOCATION> policeman, and later <PERSON> Tullier </PERSON> to create the remote-control bomb and plan its use. Federal authorities estimate that <PERSON> Tardo </PERSON> paid <PERSON> McClendon </PERSON> a total of $ 34,000 over the years to kill <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON>. Several days after the bombing, <PERSON> Tardo </PERSON> gave <PERSON> McClendon </PERSON> $ 8,000, most of which went to <PERSON> Tullier </PERSON> to buy cocaine for sale, <PERSON> Africk </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The dollar fell slightly in quiet European trading today as traders balanced their books ahead of a long Easter weekend and remained bearish following weak <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic figures. Gold prices were mixed. Foreign exchange dealers said the market continued to take heed of a lower-than-expected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> durable goods figure released Wednesday. The 3.6 percent fall in new factory orders in February, instead of an expected 0.6 percent rise, signaled that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inflation may not be accelerating as rapidly as believed. The figures were taken as a further sign of weaker growth in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost 1.7265 dollars to buy one pound, more expensive than 1.7225 dollars late Wednesday. Other mid-morning dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Wednesday: _ 1.8635 West German marks, down from 1.8693 _ 1.6155 Swiss francs, down from 1.6225 _ 6.3165 French francs, down from 6.3345 _ 2.1017 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1115 _ 1,371.00 Italian lire, down from 1,373.10 _ 1.1885 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1897 In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar fell 0.52 yen Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted lower at 130.75 yen. Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 395.10 a troy ounce, up from a late bid price of $ 394.75 a troy ounce Wednesday. At mid-morning <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $ 396.

 President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> told visiting <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> journalists that by always rejecting <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> overtures for peace, their government is acting as the <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> did for 40 years. `` You are still living in illusion.

The session occurred days before the 10th anniversary on Sunday of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s peace treaty with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, still the only peace accord between an Arab country and the Jewish state. Citing <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s December proclamations as evidence, <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> said the Arabs have changed their intransigent positions and are making proposals for peace. He said they encounter repeated negativism from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, which has refused to deal with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> noted that there has been discord in the region for four decades and warned that 40 more years without peace would be disastrous, especially in light of the `` new weapons of mass destruction.'' The only answer, he said, is for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to talk peace with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, repeating a common Egyptian theme. `` There's no way, do n't bother. You will have to talk to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>,'' the president said. `` We ca n't fool ourselves. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is everywhere. Those at your end wo n't stop unless they have some hope in life. Believe me they wo n't talk to you alone, and I know what I am saying.'' He referred to Palestinians in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> who for the last 15 months have had almost daily riots against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s occupying forces <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war.

Joking with peace advocate <PERSON> Abie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON>, who said he would beam Arabic lessons on a radio station he runs, <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> said in English: `` I am giving you a good lesson in the Arabic language to persuade your people to learn Arabic and cooperate with the Arab people.''

 A man convicted of torturing and murdering his sister-in-law and trying to kill his wife should spend the rest of his life behind bars, said the judge who sentenced him. `` You must never be free. You must never be in a position where this can happen again,'' Circuit Judge <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> told <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> as he sentenced him Wednesday to life plus 164 years, nine months in prison. <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>, 25, of <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, was charged with 18 counts in the 1986 killing of his wife's sister, <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenz </PERSON>, 17, and the attempted murder of his 22-year-old wife in September in this northern <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> town. He pleaded guilty to nine charges, including the kidnapping and first-degree murder of Miss <PERSON> Lenz </PERSON> and the attempted murder of his wife, but pleaded innocent to charges of sexual assault and mutilation. A jury convicted him of the sexual assault and mutilation charges and decided <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> was sane at the time of the attacks. <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>'s attorney has said he will appeal. Among the evidence was a tape recording describing the slaying that <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> said he made to scare his wife but never played for her. `` This court must insure that no other unsuspecting female is ever exposed to your depravity. There is no way that I could face the family of such a girl,'' the judge said. <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>'s wife said she was satisfied with the sentence. <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> was accused of using a lighted cigar, safety pin and wheelbarrow handle to assault her before beating her with a shovel.

<HEAD>Museum Officials Meet With Cree Seeking Sacred Relic</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A group of Cree Indians who are asking the American Museum of Natural History to return a sacred symbol will be true to their heritage and wait patiently for the museum's decision, their spokesman said. After meeting with <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Thunder </PERSON> and three other Cree Indians from western <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> Wednesday, museum officials said it could take them a week to decide whether to give up the cloth bundle holding bear claws, sweet grass and a clump of tobacco. Officials are concerned about <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Thunder </PERSON>'s standing among the <LOCATION> Cree </LOCATION> people, his self-proclaimed `` mandate'' to claim the object and his relationship to Chief Big Bear, who created the relic more than 150 years ago, museum spokesman <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurz </PERSON> said. Thunder completed a 2,700-mile run from <LOCATION> Edmonton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION>, on Tuesday to voice his claim for the artifact. The 38-year-old <PERSON> Cree </PERSON> has said he was inspired by numerous dreams and visions in which Big Bear directed him to fetch the sacred bundle, which has been in the museum collection for more than 50 years. Thunder wants to return it to his people for use in traditional religious ceremonies. `` It's our tradition as <LOCATION> Cree </LOCATION> people to respect and have patience. The bundle is away for 55 years so I think we can wait for another few days,'' said <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardinal </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kurz </PERSON> said a curator in the anthropology department would consider Thunder's presentation and make a recommendation to museum officials. He said Thunder had downplayed his role as a political representative of the <LOCATION> Cree </LOCATION> and stressed that he had a `` spiritual mandate'' to return the relic. `` To us a political mandate would be, to make it as simple as possible, numbers of persons who agree that he should be the person to take it out of the -LRB- museum -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Kurz </PERSON> said. Other Cree, whom <PERSON> Kurz </PERSON> would not identify, have told museum officials Thunder does not represent the majority of their people and have asked that the museum keep the sacred bundle in its collection or give it to them, the spokesman said. Thunder admits he is not a blood relative of the chief. He was adopted several years ago by a woman who was Big Bear's great-granddaughter The sacred bundle, made by Big Bear when he was 13 years old, was given to a museum anthropologist in 1934 for safekeeping by a son of Big Bear. Since then, it has been in the museum's research department but has never been on public display.

<TEXT>
 Critics of `` shock jock'' <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> were pleased that KSJO-FM decided to fire the controversial disc jockey they had accused of using racial and sexist slurs in his popular morning talk show. Stone was fired Tuesday after separate incidents during his March 10 show in which he insulted an unidentified girl and advised two 9-year-old Brownies to steal Girl Scout cookie money, station officials said. `` <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> has been occupying a lot of my life lately, and I'm very glad to have it gone,'' said <PERSON> Marjorie </PERSON> <PERSON> Boehm </PERSON>, leader of a group that had filed a complaint against <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION> with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Poritz </PERSON>, who stood up to Stone when he suggested she and another 9-year-old <PERSON> Brownie </PERSON> pocket money from cookie sales, said `` Great,'' when she learned of the firing. `` He was a jerk. He was ugly,'' <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said. Stone, 30, was criticized for his slurs against women, minorities and the disabled during his show at the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> station, which became top-rated among men ages 18 to 34. `` I still believe <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> is a very talented guy,'' said General Manager <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Baronfeld </PERSON>. `` But what happened March 10 was something that placed the station, the company, and the people at the station at risk that was n't there before.'' Another segment that aired the same day exposed the station to a possible lawsuit when Stone insulted another girl on the air, said <PERSON> Baronfeld </PERSON>. Station attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurley </PERSON> on Tuesday would not reveal the girl's name and said he had no tape or transcript. Stone recorded a retraction Friday that will be broadcast four times during the next four weeks, the last time <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION> will be heard on <ORGANIZATION> KSJO </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Hurley </PERSON> said. Stone, who was informed of the decision on Tuesday evening, could not be reached for comment. A man answering an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> call to the station declined to comment or to contact Stone, who is not listed in the telephone listings for the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> area.

<HEAD>120 Dead As Bloody Violence Continues In Sri Lanka</HEAD>

 More than 120 people have been killed this week in an upsurge of political violence by Sinhalese extremists trying to topple the Sinhalese-dominated government, authorities said. The government of President <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> has vowed to deal harshly with the rebels, who it blames for the rise in murders on this strife-torn <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> island. `` We have to get rid of subversives one day or another. The sooner the better,'' Deputy Defense Minister <PERSON> Ranjan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wijeratne </PERSON> told a news conference late Wednesday. <PERSON> Wijeratne </PERSON> said at least 60 people were killed in northern <LOCATION> Anuradhapura </LOCATION> province on Tuesday, a <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> holiday. Officials said at least 53 people were killed Sunday and Monday, and nine were killed Wednesday as the extremists crippled the island with a daylong strike by threatening violence against anyone trying to do business. Most of the victims have been members of the governing <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> or policemen, <PERSON> Wijeratne </PERSON> said. `` The laws will be ameded to strengthen the hand of the security forces against the subversives,'' he said late Wendesday. `` We are now working without emergency laws, subversives can not be controlled by ordinary laws.'' Subversives is the official term for members of the extremist <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, which contends the government has offered too many concessions to the minority Tamils, who have been fighting for a separate homeland in the north and east since 1983. <PERSON> Wijeratne </PERSON> said the Sinhalese extremists were killing security personnel and government suppoers because they were `` desperate'' following military and police operations. `` The pressure is on them and we are closing in,'' he said. <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>, elected to a six-year term on Dec. 19, took office on Jan. 2. The newly elected members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, controlled by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, were convened on March 9. The front claims the elections were fraudulent. Tamils are mostly Hindus and make up 18 percent of the island's 16 million people They say they are denied jobs and education by the majority <PERSON> Sinhalese </PERSON>, who comprise 75 percent of the population and control the government and military. The government signed an accord in July 1987 aimed at ending the insurgency by offering the Tamils limited autonomy in exchange for surrender of weapons. But many Tamil militants rejected the accord as insufficient.

 The district attorney has shut down the Third Annual Cajun Cup professional poker tournament, forcing 1,400 players to fold. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Pyle </PERSON>, who started the tournament, blamed religious protests for the abrupt end to the 12-day event that was to have run through the weekend.

 Syrian forces today helped Moslem militias launch artillery and rocket attacks on Christian regions, witnesses said. Police said nine people were killed and 26 wounded in the fighting. Police said more than 5,000 shells and rockets hit the capital, the Christian-dominated region to the north and Druse-held territory to the southeast during nine hours of bombardments by the Christian army, the Syrians and Syrian-backed militiamen. The Christian enclave was hit with 40 rockets a minute before the firing subsided at 3 a.m. The new casualties raised the toll to 75 people killed and 237 wounded since March 8, when the latest fighting broke out between Christian troops of Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and Syrian-backed fighters of Druse warlord <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>. A statement by <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s command accused Syrian troops of involvement in the bombardment of the 310-square-mile Christian heartland, where 1 million Christians are trapped in a crescent-shaped enclave. Residents in <LOCATION> Aramoun </LOCATION>, seven miles southeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, said they saw the Syrian army firing from several positions near the village. The witnesses, insisting on anonymity, said the Syrians suffered an unspecified number of casualties in shelling from <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s forces. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said all foreign forces except <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeepers should leave <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Asked if that included the withdrawal of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, the main power broker in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> with 40,000 troops, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said: `` That would be all those non-Lebanese armed elements and organizations currently on <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> soil, with the exception of -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> -RRB-, whose mandate ... is renewed every six months at the specific request of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' Amid the violence, <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said: `` Let -LRB- Syrian -RRB- President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> relinquish power. That will be better for <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, 53, heads the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> cabinet in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s dual government. He was responding to editorials by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s official media that called for his ouster as a condition to curbing the violence in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year-old civil war. Minutes after <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s statement was broadcast by <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> radio and television his command at the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Yarze </LOCATION> was shelled, the police spokesman said. The thuds of exploding shells shook <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and the surrounding wooded hills. Trails of light behind missiles lit up the skies as residents huddled in basements and bomb shelters. `` Do n't forget to turn off butane cylinders before heading to shelters. Do not use lifts. Keep windows open to avoid shards from shattered glass in case of explosions,'' Voice of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, the main radio station in Christian east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, warned listeners. The latest violence broke out two days after <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> blockaded militia-run ports to reactivate tax collection at five government harbors on <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 130-mile Mediterranean coast. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s militia allies rejected the move. The latest crisis began Sept. 22 when parliament could not meet to elect a successor to President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> appointed <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> head of an interim military cabinet. Syrian-backed Moslems rejected the appointment.

 Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> says a new parliament now being formed should debate foreign policy issues in order to prevent the kind of closed-door decision making that sent Soviet troops into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. In an interview published Wednesday by the government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestiya </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said, `` I foresee the time when open debates on some or other international problems will become natural practice.'' `` High officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, the minister included, will be giving answers to informal questions from deputies, when referendums and public opinion polls will be held before taking fundamental decisions,'' he said. The Soviet policy of glasnost, or greater openness on some issues, has affected mainly internal issues. Dissent on questions of foreign policy has only recently surfaced in the media. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies is being formed now. It will consist of 750 representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, its affiliates, professsional and social organizations, and 1,500 members elected from geographical districts. Voting for geographical districts will take place Sunday, but the organizations are electing their deputies now. The congress will then choose from among its members a new Supreme Soviet parliament. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said the new parliament, by serving as a forum for foreign policy debates, could bring about `` new forms of glasnost in foreign policy and diplomacy,'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said. President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who launched the current reorganization, also says the new legislature must take a greater role in setting policy. Under the Soviet Constitution, any decision to use armed forces abroad must be sanctioned by the Supreme Soviet, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said. Top Soviet officials have criticized the process that led to the <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> intervention in 1979, saying a narrow group of people made the decision without consulting anyone. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> pulled its remaining troops out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> last month after nine years of war and an estimated 15,000 dead.

<HEAD>Police Hunt For Detonators After Explosion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PETERBOROUGH, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police today searched for dangerous detonators that were strewn across an area when a truck carrying explosives blew up, and the government announced new rules for the transport of explosives. A firefighter was killed and more than 80 people were injured, 11 seriously, after the truck caught fire and blew up Wednesday at an industrial park in <LOCATION> Peterborough </LOCATION>, 75 miles north of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Transport Minister <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Bottomley </PERSON> said the changes in government regulations, which had been planned before the blast, will require vehicles to advertise that they carry explosives. <PERSON> Bottomley </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> that the new rules, expected to take effect in July, will require placards to be displayed on vehicles and better training of drivers. `` We must learn the lessons both on how to make existing regulations work and on how to make sure regulations can be modified at least to maintain safety,'' he said. <PERSON> Bottomley </PERSON> said the death of fireighter <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphries </PERSON> was the first in an accident involving the transport of explosives since 1957. Police said about 10 percent of the more than 750 detonators in the truck at the time of the blast had been found by late morning, some on the roofs of neighboring buildings. Police sealed off the area and were using sniffer dogs to track down the copper cyanide detonators, which they said will explode if dropped or struck hard. `` The experts are there to search the area and make it safe,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Cambridgeshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, speaking of the bomb experts, police, fire and transport officials at the scene. The tanker truck had been carrying explosives and detonators to a nearby fireworks factory when it caught fire outside in an industrial park. Soon after firefighters arrived, and before the park could be evacuated, the truck blew up. Witnesses said it was `` torn to shreds'' and the wreckage was strewn more than 900 feet. The Fire Brigade said it was not told the truck was carrying explosives. The truck had a small label in the back saying it carried explosives, said <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Robson </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> ICI </ORGANIZATION>, the company that owned the truck. <PERSON> Robson </PERSON> said the cause of the explosion was under investigation by the company and government officials.

<HEAD>Japanese Opposition Party Demands Resignation Of Takeshita, Cabinet</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Clean Government Party today joined other opposition groups in demanding the prime minister and his <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> resign, saying a stock scandal has stripped the government of its mandate to rule. <PERSON> Junya </PERSON> <PERSON> Yano </PERSON>, chairman of the second-largest opposition party, told reporters that public distrust in the government `` has reached a critical level'' because of the so-called Recruit stock scandal involving Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> and a number of prominent figures in the governing circle. An unpopular 3-percent sales tax, effective April 1, will further erode public confidence in government, <PERSON> Yano </PERSON> said. `` The Cabinet should immediately resign to let opposition parties form an interim government for the management of new, general elections,'' <PERSON> Yano </PERSON> told a news conference at the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Yano </PERSON> was referring to the Recruit scandal, in which the information conglomerate <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> offered hundreds of thousands of unlisted shares in its real estate subsidiary to more than 150 people, including politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s secretary was implicated, as was former Prime Minister <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>'s secretary, in the scandal in which many recipients of the stock sold the shares for handsome profits. The scandal, rocking the Japanese establishment since the summer, has seen the arrest of 13 people and the resignation of three Cabinet ministers. All opposition groups but the <ORGANIZATION> Clean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> had been demanding that the Cabinet resign and the powerful lower house of Parliament be dissolved to clarify the responsibility of the government. <PERSON> Yano </PERSON> explained that his party had waited for <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> to make an honorable retreat by dissolving the Cabinet on his own initiative. `` But, we have come to a conclusion that Mr. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> has an illusion that he can survive the crisis ... Now we'll fight to topple his government.'' The Clean Government Party, backed by the huge <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> organization <LOCATION> Soka </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gakkai </LOCATION>, has 200,000 members nationwide and holds 79 seats in the two houses of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, making it the second-strongest opposition force after the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which has 128 seats.

<TEXT>
 A 10-year-old convicted of selling crack has been sentenced to 18 months at a home for troubled youngsters, where care-givers say his behavior is improving and he is `` thrilled he can finally read.'' Family Court Judge <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Auperin </PERSON> on Wednesday sent the boy to the Little Flower Children's Services home in <LOCATION> Wading </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, 30 miles from his home on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. The boy was arrested Jan. 14 as he and a 14-year-old tried to flee a drug raid in <LOCATION> Wyandanch </LOCATION>. Police said he dropped a bag containing three $ 20 vials of crack. Police also found $ 226 on the boys. Auperin found the child delinquent. The 14-year-old's case is being handled separately. The judge agreed to open the proceedings against the 10-year-old because of public interest in the case but asked that the boy's name be withheld because of his age. The child was held in a children's shelter after his arrest and was moved to <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Flower </LOCATION> on Feb. 27. <PERSON> Adrienne </PERSON> <PERSON> Carr </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the home, said the boy is doing well in school. `` He's so thrilled he can finally read,'' she said. Probation officers had recommended the maximum of 18 months at a juvenile detention facility north of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. After the judge's ruling, the child turned to his mother and said, `` I bet you're happy they're not sending me upstate.''

 Chinese officials today ruled out the formation of new political parties and said the eight parties that operate under communist control will contine to be closely regulated. Leaders of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s eight so-called democratic parties also said they expected more government officials to be appointed from their ranks. On Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> authorities announced a plan to allow the eight parties to participate in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s government. <PERSON> Yan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mingfu </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s office that deals with other parties, said the plan will be ready by June or July. Cooperation among the eight parties, he said, will occur only under the leadership of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which has ruled <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> since 1949. The plan comes as a growing number of intellectuals are calling for more political freedom and appears to be an attempt by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to silence critics without relinquishing power. Today's announcement, which came at a news conference on multiparty cooperation, further emphasized this point. The news conference was held by the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consultative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, a prestigious but powerless advisory body currently meeting in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. `` The Communist Party of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the eight democratic parties share the same goals.

 Soldiers shot and killed a 14-year-old Palestinian during a confrontation with stone-throwing youths in a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village today, and 10 Palestinians were wounded in the occupied territories, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> doctors said. The army confirmed three Palestinians were wounded and said it was checking the other reported casualties. An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> newspaper, meanwhile, reported that <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> has proposed a peace plan that calls for a demilitarized Palestinian state with its own parliament. An aide to <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, who is finance minister, denied the report. `` There is no Palestinian state in that plan,'' said <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gil </PERSON>. But <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> legislator <PERSON> Avrum </PERSON> <PERSON> Burg </PERSON> confirmed the broad outlines of the report in the daily <ORGANIZATION> Haaretz </ORGANIZATION>, which said the plan included a one-year truce between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION>. `` That's the general direction, but it's very embryonic,'' said <PERSON> Burg </PERSON>, who declined to comment further. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> has said he would only launch a personal peace initiative if the plan to be presented by Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> next month fails to advance the peace process. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has said his own peace plan to be presented in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> will not include any territorial compromise.

Residents said the confrontation broke out after the army raided the village and a 13-year-old Palestinian boy was wounded in the right hand. The death raised to 405 the number of Palestinians killed since the start of the 15-month revolt against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>.

 A man who claimed Israeli agents killed his bride during a honeymoon cruise and framed him for the crime has been convicted of throwing her overboard to her death. A federal jury Wednesday found <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Roston </PERSON> guilty of murder after three days of deliberation. The prosecution said <PERSON> Roston </PERSON>, 36, of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION>, had argued with <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Waltz </PERSON> <PERSON> Roston </PERSON>, 26, and choked her and tossed her over the railing as the ship headed toward <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in 1988 at the end of a three-day cruise to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Roston </PERSON>'s defense was that <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> agents on board drugged him and killed his wife for writing the book `` Nightmare in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' in which he claimed he was brutalized in an Israeli mental hospital after his arrest on a robbery charge. `` The defense was absurd. His claim was absurd,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON> said at a news conference. The defense called no witnesses. The prosecution offered testimony from one of two Israelis, a <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> photographer, who had been aboard the ship. The man denied he was a government agent. `` He's disappointed,'' defense attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenner </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Roston </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> feels that it's incomprehensible for anyone to believe that he would have killed his wife that he loved very dearly.'' <PERSON> Kenner </PERSON> said he will appeal on the ground that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> courts lacked jurisdiction because the ship was registered in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> and the crime took place on the high seas. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Kendra </PERSON> <PERSON> McNally </PERSON> said the ship was partly owned by Americans, conferring jurisdiction here. Federal guidelines call for 11 to 14 years in prison, but the judge could sentence <PERSON> Roston </PERSON> to up to life. Sentencing was set for June 5. Jury forewoman <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattaddocon </PERSON> said jurors immediately rejected the claim about <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> agents. `` Why on a honeymoon cruise would a man take his bride's life? That bothered all of us,'' said another juror, <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Kellogg </PERSON>. `` We could n't get into his mind. We could only surmise it was a fit of anger.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Roston </PERSON>'s body was found 30 miles off <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. An autopsy revealed she died of strangulation associated with drowning.

<TEXT>
 The government today said it began arming police with about 13,000 M-16 rifles to defend their posts against attacks by radical protesters, a move critics said can only incite more violence. Police ordered about 5,000 investigators to remain on indefinite alert and to arrest leftists, said the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Chosun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ilbo </ORGANIZATION>. Riots broke out after the tough measures were announced. Authorities said about 3,400 students, hurling firebombs and rocks, battled riot police today outside campuses in four cities. President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo on Wednesday ordered security forces to crack down on radicals and dissidents, calling them a major threat to political stability. `` All government offices must cooperate to root out the violent and destructive acts of leftists attempting to overthrow the government,'' a presidential spokesman quoted <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> as telling security officials. The government said it was allowing police to carry guns and use them in self-defense in response to mounting firebomb attacks on police stations. The country's police have until now rarely carried guns, normally using only tear gas and shields to defend themselves. Senior government officials, who declined to be further identified, said U.S.-built semi-automatic M-16s were issued today to police. Opposition parties charged that the move only would aggravate unrest. Issuing M-16s was `` tantamont to declaring a war against the people,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Reunification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. On Monday, <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> announced that he was postponing indefinitely a national referendum on his performance that he had promised before his election. He blamed the postponement on threats from radical groups and discord over how to hold the referendum. But there were indications <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> might have difficulty winning a victory in the referendum and could be pressured into calling new elections. Many South Koreans are critical of the government for failing to sever links with <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s authoritarian predecessor, former President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>. Radicals have staged numerous violent anti-government protests, but they have little support and are not seen as a threat to government stability. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> reportedly is under pressure from government hardliners to end the protests. Prosecutor-General <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gi-chun </PERSON> followed <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s directive by issuing orders today for a nationwide crackdown on all pro-North Korean activities. He ordered the seizure of pro-North Korean publications, the closure of private institutes used by radical groups to spread communist ideology and the arrest of people using firebombs to attack government facilities. Many radicals have leftist leanings but deny supporting <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The three main opposition parties, which control the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, agreed today to call a parliamentary hearing on the firearms order. The largest opposition party, the <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement today: `` We strongly oppose the use of firearms. The only way to restore social and political stability is to continue democratic reforms.'' The largest dissident group, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, called on the government to withdraw the decision, calling it `` an open threat to democratic forces.'' Thousands of students staged violent protests around campuses today in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and three other cities. In <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, riot police stopped about 800 students who tried to march out of <ORGANIZATION> Sejong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> to demand <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>' ouster. In <LOCATION> Suwon </LOCATION>, about 700 students armed with hundreds of firebombs battled riot police for three hours, denouncing <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s order, according to the South Korean news agency <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION>. At least five students and three police were injured, <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> also reported violent anti-government protests in <LOCATION> Taejon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> where about 2,200 students hurled about 1,200 firebombs at riot police, who responded with barrages of tear gas.

 <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said today he is convinced the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration favors in principle convening an international <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace conference. His comments came one day after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> representatives talked for 4 -LCB- hours in their first formal meeting since <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took office. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> talked about reducing tension in the Israeli-occupied lands, but the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> vowed the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising will not let up until <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> withdraws from the territories. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> told reporters today that the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> believes the only solution to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> crisis is an international conference involving all of the parties, including the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the five permanent members of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. `` As for the American administration, they are for an international conference in principle but say it should be very well prepared,'' the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman asserted. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> opposes the idea of an international conference, as it does the American decision to talk with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, while not enthusiastic about an international conference, said such a conference could be helpful if it led to direct Arab-Israeli talks. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, speaking to reporters in a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> office, said a leadership meeting was held Wednesday night. `` Our evaluation, one, is that we consider that the content of the meeting was a positive one and, second, it was a serious one in so far as the topics on the agenda were concerned,'' said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, wearing his traditional Arab headdress and green military uniform. `` We consider the meeting an indication of the new American administration is seriously interested in this PLO-American dialogue.'' Officials at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> refused to discuss the meeting and referred all queries or requests for comment to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said it was <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s responsibility to ease tension in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, where more than 400 Palestinians and 17 Israelis have died in the 15-month-old uprising. `` I understand that a request for reducing tension is directed at <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> because it is <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> that is causing the tension _ not only the army, but settler groups using arms against Palestinians,'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said. A first contact between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> occurred Dec. 16, shortly after <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> reversed a 13-year policy of refusing to deal with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. That decision followed <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s public renunciation of terrorism and recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist Wednesday's session was the first to get down to the substantive issues of peace and conflict in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, terrorism, negotiations and who represents the Palestinian people, delegates from both sides said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> rejects the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> as a terrorist organization. Asked by reporters if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> demanded the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> put an end to the uprising, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said, `` No such request was presented by anyone, and no one can ask us to do that. No one can stop a people from resisting occupation.'' No date for a further session was announced, but both American and <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials said they fully expected the talks to continue. `` The issues wo n't be finished in one meeting, even two,'' said the chief <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> delegate, <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Abed-Rabbo </PERSON>. The leading <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegate, Ambassador <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON>, said he `` focused on practical steps which can be taken to reduce tensions in the occupied territories and lead to direct negotiations.'' <PERSON> Abed-Rabbo </PERSON> said he stressed to the Americans that the source of the violence in the territories was `` the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation and the Israeli repressive measures.'' He said: `` The -LRB- uprising -RRB- will continue until the Israelis evacuate our homeland.'' Neither side was precise about what proposals may have been made with regard to the territories or specific areas discussed.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> approved mandatory drug tests for city employees but did not extend the policy to itself, even after one member said he had abused `` just about everything.'' Instead, the council on Wednesday approved a measure asking members to take voluntary drug tests. `` I have smoked, snorted, sneezed, drank _ just about everything,'' said Councilman <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Lipscomb </PERSON>, 64. `` I have abused drugs, alcohol, et al. Let's show some leadership and be the first to take the test.'' But after an hour's debate, his amendment proposing that council members be tested for drugs before city employees was defeated 8-3. <PERSON> Lipscomb </PERSON>, an independent councilman known for his outspokenness, said today that he used drugs in the 1940s and the 1950s but quit when `` I found the Lord.'' `` I took drugs in the days I was sowing my oats,'' he said. `` We called it reefer back then. I have n't been 64 always.'' The drug policy for city employees takes effect Oct. 1 and stipulates that all people applying for `` safety sensitive'' positions _ such as driver, mechanic and maintenance worker _ must take drug and alcohol tests to be hired. About two-thirds of city jobs fall under the policy. In addition, an employee would be asked to take drug or alcohol tests if two supervisors determined there was `` reasonable suspicion'' that the employee was using drugs or alcohol. An employee who refused testing could face disciplinary action. City Attorney <PERSON> Analeslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Muncy </PERSON> said she did not think <PERSON> Lipscomb </PERSON>'s proposed amendment would have withstood a legal challenge because council members are not in `` safety sensitive'' positions and because the test would be required without `` reasonable suspicion. On Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upheld drug testing for railway workers involved in accidents, and, by a narrower margin, for <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> workers seeking assignments as drug enforcement agents or in jobs requiring them to carry firearms. Experts were divided on whether the rulings mean the justices would be likely to accept drug testing for many other types of workers. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Burkett </PERSON>, business manager for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION>, argued against the city drug policy and said the council was yielding to `` hysteria sweeping out of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.'' `` There is no evidence that a drug problem exists among city employees,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Burkett </PERSON>, whose organization represents 400 of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>' 13,000 city workers.

 A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling striking down the city's equal division of political power among five boroughs with huge population differences prompted an immediate threat of secession from <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> responded that he would protect the interests of <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, the least populous borough. The Board of Estimate, a body unique to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, is `` a substantial departure from the one-person, one-vote ideal,'' Justice <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> wrote in the unanimous ruling striking down the city's form of government Wednesday. The justices upheld a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruling requiring a plan that meets that standard. Currently, <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, with fewer than 400,000 residents, has the same voting power on the board as <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, with 2.2 million. The board governs everything from land-use decisions to setting sewer and water rates, negotiating city contracts and awarding franchises and leasing property. It also has partial authority for the city's $ 25 billion budget. Its powers are greater than those of <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, a lawmaking body whose 35 representatives are elected from proportional districts citywide. The board is made up of the five borough presidents, each with one vote, and three citywide elected officials _ the mayor, comptroller and <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> president _ each with two votes. It was created in 1898 when the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> joined to form <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> White </PERSON> said the under-representation on the board for the city's largest boroughs is severe, and he rejected arguments that the make-up legitimately balances regional interests He said a voter is shortchanged `` if he may vote for one representative and the voters in another district half the size also elect one representative.'' The ruling left city government in disarray before November's elections, in which all eight positions on the board will be decided It also renewed calls from the smallest borough that it leave the city. <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> `` would be better off back under the rule of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>,'' said state Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Marchi </PERSON>, who is sponsoring a bill in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> to have his borough leave <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The ruling `` drops 400,000 <ORGANIZATION> Staten </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islanders </ORGANIZATION> into a colonial state by effectively separating them from the governance of the larger community in which we live,'' said <PERSON> Marchi </PERSON>. The borough's president, <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamberti </PERSON>, said: `` I will not stand up as a representative of 400,000 people and lead them in a colony state.'' But he added that if a new voting system reduces <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>'s participation in government to that of a `` spectator,'' he would give serious consideration to seceding The mayor said he's concerned about the problem, adding: `` We'll find a way to protect <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> I'll protect it.'' After the lower court ruling, <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> appointed a <ORGANIZATION> Charter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which he said would now move `` full speed ahead'' with a new governing plan in time for a November referendum. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said he expects the high court will allow the board to function until a substitute can be authorized. He also said that while he favored continuing the board, `` I never believed we could win it'' in court. The city population is more than 7 million, with wide disparities in the size of the boroughs. Besides <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>'s 2.2 million people, <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> has 1.9 million, <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> 1.4 million and the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> 1.2 million. The presidents of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> called for the board to be revised by weighting voting according to population. But <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Borough </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrer </PERSON> opposed weighted voting and instead urged a county executive form of government in each borough, removing some power from City Hall. City Council President <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> said he was n't sure if the board should change to weighted voting, but added that he was confident his own office `` will have a strong role in the new setup.'' Comptroller <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldin </PERSON>, who is expected to run against <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> for mayor, said an alternative government should make it `` impossible for a centralized administration to run roughshod over communities which, until now, have had direct input into decisions affecting them.''

<HEAD>Breakthrough Claimed in Nuclear Fusion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two scientists claim to have carried controlled nuclear fusion in a test tube, using a `` ridiculously simple'' technique that could transform the world's energy resources, it was reported today. `` If their discovery is confirmed, they will have gone a long way toward taming the forces powering the sun and the hydrogen bomb,'' <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said. `` These could provide virtually unlimited, clean and inexpensive energy.'' The paper identified the scientists as <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Southampton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION>. A formal announcement will be made in <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> later today. Nuclear fusion is regarded as science's next great frontier in developing new sources of energy, but has generally been considered to be years away from commercial exploitation. It differs from conventional processes in that it fuses atoms, rather than splits them. The Financial Times said the two scientists `` have apparently done in a simple laboratory what has not been achieved by gigantic projects costing hundreds of millions of dollars a year.'' The Fleischmann-Pons experiments technically `` are no more complex than the practical work done by chemistry undergraduates. They use electrochemical techniques to achieve fusion of deuterium nuclei trapped inside an electrode made from palladium, a metal similar to platinum,'' <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said. Dr. <PERSON> Mick </PERSON> <PERSON> Lomer </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.K. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>'s fusion laboratory, told the newspaper: `` We're approaching it with a skeptical but open mind. We shall be doing our utmost to reproduce the experiment.'' Fusion produces little radioactive waste; its material, deuterium, is abundant in seawater; and fusion reactors are expected to be safer than fission reactors because the fusion process would shut down if anything went wrong. One past problem has been safely containing the reaction. The newspaper quoted <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> as saying: `` What we have done is open the door to a new area of research. Our indications are that the discovery will be reasonably easy to make into a usable technology for generating heat and power, but a lot more work is needed to prove its validity further and then to develop practical generating devices.'' He was quoted as saying: `` The nature of the experiment is ridiculously simple, yet in a way so far-fetched, that we decided not to raise money from external sources but to finance the early work ourselves.'' The paper said physicists `` find it hard to believe the deuterium nuclei could be squeezed together enough for fusion to occur.'' In a separate report, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said the discovery could `` transform the outlook for the world's energy supplies in the next century.'' It said the idea for the experiment originated in the 1960s, and <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> began discussing possible test methods while working together at <LOCATION> Southhampton </LOCATION> and then at <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> and I often talk of doing insane experiments,'' said <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON>, 61. `` We each have a good track record of getting impossible experiments to work. In this case, the stakes were so high that we just had to try out the idea.''

<HEAD>Court Allows Adult Bookstore to Stay Open</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Illinois' highest court has barred authorities from closing down an adult bookstore under the state's public nuisance law The <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled 4-2 on Wednesday that the law could not be used against the <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> II Bookstore near <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION> because it might prevent the sale of non-obscene books and magazines protected by the First Amendment. State's Attorney <PERSON> Dallas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingemunson </PERSON>, who filed 44 criminal obscenity cases against the bookstore from 1982 to 1986, expressed disappointment at the ruling, which he said would be appealed to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Because of obscenity violations, a lower-court judge had ordered the store to close or post a $ 5,000 bond to be forfeited if the sale of obscene matter resumed. The store persisted and was ordered closed in 1987 under a law that allows a judge to shut down a building for a year if it is deemed a public nuisance. The high court said the order to post bond or close `` smacks of prior restraint,'' which is unconstitutional. The justices noted that in a dozen previous trials, some of the magazines sold at the store were found not to be obscene. Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said the law takes a `` blunderbuss approach to the regulation of obscenity'' and that law enforcement officials had `` far less draconian'' means available, including prosecuting smut peddlers. Justice <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, in a dissent, said the close-and-bond provision does n't restrict free speech because the bookstore can remain open as long as it sells non-obscene material.

<DATELINE>PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The legislature in a southern province today approved constitutional amendments that would reduce its autonomy, prompting clashes between police and thousands of ethnic Albanians opposed to the change. The <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency said the amendments were approved by 176 of the 188 <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> province lawmakers. They are designed to give the country's largest republic of mainly Christian <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> a greater degree of control over the affairs of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, which has a mainly Moslem ethnic Albanian majority. It was not immediately clear why the deputies, about 80 percent of whom are ethnic <PERSON> Albanian </PERSON>, would vote for the measure. But there was a report that some deputies may have been intimidated by state security police. The decision prompted demontrations by about 3,000 people in the town of <LOCATION> Urosevac </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> province. Hundreds of club-wielding police dispersed the protesters, who were chanting slogans against the changes, <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said. Police also stopped about 200 ethnic <PERSON> Albanian </PERSON> women and children who attempted to march in protest from <LOCATION> Urosevac </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION>, witnesses said. <LOCATION> Urosevac </LOCATION> is 15 miles north of the provincial capital, <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION>. Ethnic Albanians, who make up about 85 percent of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s 1.8 million inhabitants, have in the past opposed the changes, claiming they would restrict wide autonomy granted to the region by the <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s 1974 Constitution. More than 100,000 ethnic Albanians demonstrated in November in <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION>, and thousands walked off their jobs in February to protest the amendments. The protests prompted <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s federal presidency to impose a partial state of emergency in the province last month. Under today's changes, <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> would no longer need the approval of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s Parliament to approve amendments in the Serbian Constitution that affect the province. <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> would also get tighter control over the judiciary and police. Serbian authorities have been pressing for the changes of the constitution, claiming they are necessary to provide greater security for <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s mainly Serbian minority, which they claim is being harassed and forced to emigrate from the region by the ethnic Albanian majority. Ethnic Albanians have disputed this claim, contending that the Serbians are emigrating from the province due to its severe economic problems, which include a 30 percent unemployment rate and average monthly incomes of less than $ 100. Ethnic Albanians say that if the <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> legislature's approval is no longer necessary for future constitutional changes, such rights as the use of the Albanian language in official matters and in education could be restricted. The <PERSON> Mladina </PERSON> biweekly from <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s northern republic of <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> reported in its current issue that a considerable number of the deputies in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> have been `` invited'' in the past few days by the state security police `` for talks and consultations'' on how they would vote. Several intellectuals from the country's other republics have claimed that the vote in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on the amendments `` was undemocratic since it is conducted amid emergency measures in the province.''

<HEAD>FCC Orders Cut in Long-Distance Access Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has ordered the nation's local telephone companies to reduce their interstate calling access charges by $ 705 million, which will require <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to cut its long-distance rates again. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday directed local exchange carriers to file revisions to their interstate access rates to be effective April 1. The local companies last Dec. 30 proposed reductions of $ 489 million in the charges they levy on <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T and other long-distance carriers to connect with the local phone networks. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> said that based upon data collected since their December filing, the local companies had understated expected demand and costs. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T last month proposed a $ 533 million reduction in rates effective April 1 to reflect the anticipated lower charges it would have to pay the local companies. The $ 533 million cut also reflected savings to <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T from the scheduled April 1 increase in the so-called subscriber line charge that residential and small business customers pay to maintain the local phone system. That charge rises by 30 cents a month to $ 3.50 on April 1.

 A black detainee in critical condition after 34 days on a hunger strike vowed today to maintain his fast until the government releases him. <PERSON> Sandile </PERSON> <PERSON> Thusi </PERSON>, a 26-year-old researcher at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natal </ORGANIZATION>, told a reporter who visited him that he has lost 57 pounds, about one-third his weight, during his fast to protest his detention without trial. `` Do n't worry, I'm fine,'' said <PERSON> Thusi </PERSON>, who is at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aidans </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in the port of <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>. He appeared in good spirits and said he had no intention of eating until he was freed. <PERSON> Thusi </PERSON> had an intravenous tube attached to his arm that supplies some nutrition. Doctors have described his condition as critical and said he risks blindness and brain damage if he continues refusing food. More than 3,000 students, academics and university officials attended a prayer service today at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natal </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Thusi </PERSON> worked until he was detained nine months ago. At a campus demonstration earlier today, the Roman Catholic archbishop of <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Denis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurley </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Thusi </PERSON> had `` great courage.'' <PERSON> Hurley </PERSON> said he was upset by the `` conscience of the South African state, which claimed to uphold Christian standards.'' The university's vice chancellor, P.D. <PERSON> Booysen </PERSON>, said he had appealed to government officials `` to intervene on behalf of our dying colleague.'' Police say they are reviewing the status of all detainees, but have not indicated if they plan to release Thusi soon. About 600 detainees have staged hunger strikes for varying periods since January, demanding to be released or put on trial. The detainees are being held without charge under terms of the state of emergency in effect since 1986. The government says it has authorized the release of 580 detainees since mid-February, but human rights groups say at least 300 people remain in detention, including 60 hunger strikers. Four hunger strikers who escaped Monday from a <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> hospital and took refuge at the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> left their refuge Wednesday after receiving assurances they would not be jailed. The four called for Thusi's release.

 A policeman was reported in fair condition today in the aftermath of a shootout in which another officer and a gunman were killed at a public housing unit described as a haven for drug users. The injured policeman, identified as <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Chelchowski </PERSON>, was at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Center </LOCATION> with leg wounds, said <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION> police spokesman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilleary </PERSON>. He was taken there by helicopter after the shootout late Wednesday in this <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, suburb. Another policeman, Cpl. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, 40, a 13-year veteran of the force, was killed in the shootout, as was the gunman, whose identity was not released. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> suffered massive head injuries from a shotgun blast. The public housing unit where the gunman terrorized five hostages and called for a `` rock'' of crack cocaine was known as a haven for drug users, said <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Moran </PERSON>. <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> said eviction proceedings had been undertaken against the family where the shooting happened, but he expressed frustration with the 60-day timetable for eviction. `` It's federal property and you have to go through a labyrinthine legal system,'' he said. `` There are tens of thousands of people in the metro region that are deserving of subsidized housing and desperately in need of it, and to have people use public housing as a crack house is intolerable,'' he said. The 2 -LCB- - hour siege began when the shotgun-wielding man entered the house Wednesday afternoon and took the five hostages, police spokesman <PERSON> Hilleary </PERSON> said `` I thought I was a dead man,'' one unidentified former hostage told WUSA-TV. `` He kept saying, ` I want a rock. I'm not going to hurt anyone, but I want a rock.''' Police began negotiating with the gunman and the hostages were released one at a time, <PERSON> Hilleary </PERSON> said. The gunman eventually emerged from the back door, holding a shotgun to the head of a hostage and demanding that police drop their weapons. One officer fired at the gunman, who fired back, shooting two policeman. In the ensuing fight, the hostage escaped unharmed and the gunman was killed, <PERSON> Hilleary </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, a historic port city, is across the <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, whose drug-related killings have earned it notoriety as the nation's murder capital.

<HEAD>Order Arrest Of Stroessner Son For ``Illegal Enrichment''</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A judge has ordered the arrest of air force Col. <PERSON> Gustavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, son of deposed President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, for `` illegal enrichment'' through extortion and influence peddling, officials said today. The younger <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> accompanied his father into exile in neighboring <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> on Feb. 5, two days after Gen. <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> staged a violent coup and proclaimed himself provisonal president. Criminal Court Judge <PERSON> Dario </PERSON> <PERSON> Caballero </PERSON> <PERSON> Bracho </PERSON> ordered Col. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s arrest late Wednesday after receiving a police report describing how he `` illictly obtained copious amounts of money.'' The report, published in part today's edition of the <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diario </ORGANIZATION>, describes the younger <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> as a `` fugitive.'' Officials said the court has the option to seek an extradition order following investigation of the charges against <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>. The police report noted Col. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> received at least $ 725,000 monthly from three <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION> bingo houses between 1985 to 1988. `` He used psychological pressure, saying, ` If you do n't give me my cut I can close the business or give it to someone else,''' police spokesman <PERSON> Osvaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Palacios </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` Everyone knew this man -LRB- <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> -RRB- had the power to decide,'' he added. Gambling is legal in <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> and bingo houses and casinos operate under concessions granted by the government. The police report also noted that the younger <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> was a major stockholder in the insurance company <ORGANIZATION> Mundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.A. </ORGANIZATION> which won several contracts from builders of two hydroelectric projects: <ORGANIZATION> Itaipu </ORGANIZATION> on the Brazilian border and <ORGANIZATION> Yacyreta </ORGANIZATION> on the border with <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. Col. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> received $ 21 million in insurance fees from <LOCATION> Itaipu </LOCATION> alone, the police report added. `` Part of this money was ill-gotten, while another portion was a legitimate result of the business,'' <PERSON> Palacios </PERSON> said. The police report also said Col. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> `` used his influence to obtain contracts for third parties ... in exchange for cash award.'' Interior Minister <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Machuca </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> announced, meanwhile, that four former <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> government officials had been sent to the interior of the country `` for security reasons'' while charges against them are studied.

 Officials of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airline </ORGANIZATION>'s striking <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union and pilots union will sit on a creditors committee that will review any bankruptcy reorganization plan the crippled carrier proposes. The union representing the airline's flight attendants did n't get a seat on the committee, a move their union president today called a `` slap in the face.'' However, the creditors' panel does include a representative of non-union employees, most of whom were laid off a few days after the Machinists' walkout began and are demanding back pay. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, the federal trustee supervising <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s bankruptcy reorganization, appointed the 15-member committee Wednesday In addition to the employee representatives, the members are mainly from aircraft and engine makers, banks and bondholders that have claims against <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, a federal appeals court today was scheduled to hear an <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> request to force pilots to cross Machinists' picket lines and go back to work The Machinists struck the airline on March 4 after 17 months of contract wrangling. The pilots' support for the walkout virtually grounded <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and forced it to file for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code March 9. The Eastern pilots are owed more than $ 500 million in back pay and other claims, said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, a spokesman in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Flight attendants also have honored the Machinists' picket lines. The creditors' committee has the right to review any reorganization plan proposed by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and can propose its own plan to the bankruptcy judge. The unions have opposed <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s plans to sell assets, including its agreement to sell its Northeast shuttle to developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> told a gathering of 400 creditor representatives, financial analysts and reporters the role of the creditors' panel is `` far more expansive'' than his. Eastern says it has $ 5.9 billion in assets and $ 4.5 billion in liabilities. Unsecured creditors such as ticketholders and travel agents are the most likely to lose money in a bankruptcy reorganization because they have no collateral from the debtor in case of default. The airline's secured creditors met with Eastern President <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakes </PERSON> on Tuesday. Eastern's liabilities include $ 165 million in unused tickets issued to passengers, airline attorney <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> told the creditors' meeting. `` The objective of Chapter 11 is to rebuild <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. `` It is <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s plan to resuscitate the airline and build back its flight schedule.'' The embattled airline recently started advertising for new pilots because only about 200 of its 3,600 pilots have crossed picket lines. The airline has been operating less than 10 percent of its normal schedule of 1,040 flights a day, mainly its Northeast shuttle and Latin American routes. The committee representative for non-union employees is <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> <PERSON> Shore </PERSON>. She is an elected representative of a group called PEACE, or <ORGANIZATION> Positive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, which union officials allege is sponsored by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> management. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, president of a <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> local representing <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> flight attendants, said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> that the union's exclusion from the panel is a `` slap in the face.'' `` I think it's quite insulting that every employee group at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> is on the creditors' committee except the flight attendants,'' she said. She asserted that Ms. Shore is really a representative of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> management and that PEACE is `` nothing but a union-busting group of people.''

 Parliament today appointed two <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members as government ministers for labor affairs at the end of a two-day session highlighted by introduction of political reforms. Acting on a recommendation by Prime Minister <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION>, or parliament, named <PERSON> Michal </PERSON> <PERSON> Czarski </PERSON>, 40, to be minister of labor and social policy.

Referring to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s frequent strikes, <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> said it was clear that `` relations between the state ... administration and trade unions need special attention and tactful and careful supervision.'' <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> kept the post vacant in an October Cabinet shuffle. He made an attempt to draw at least four opposition figures into his government last fall, but they declined and said they wanted to await the results of the negotiations between Solidarity and authorities. The talks are nearing completion, and parliament on Wednesday received a package of bills intended to put into law agreements reached at the table. In addition to allowing the banned Solidarity union, the farmers union Rural Solidarity and other indepedent associations to be legalized, the bills would alter the structure of the Polish government. A freely elected <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would be created and an office of the president. The parliament also would be opened up to the opposition, which could contend for up to 35 percent of the seats. On Friday, the government spokesman, <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON>, begins an official visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Urban said he did not plan to meet officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to discuss aid for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s struggling economy and its $ 38 billion foreign debt, but the government makes no secret that it will gladly accept foreign aid.

 <PERSON> Fawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> dissolved in tears today on the witness stand as she described her former boss, <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, as a tireless worker at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. Testifying at <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s trial on 12 criminal charges, she said that in many cases `` I would be almost falling asleep at the typewriter'' while <PERSON> North </PERSON> worked extraordinarily long hours at the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION>. `` He was an excellent man'' to work for, she said. She began to cry as she told <PERSON> North </PERSON> lawyer <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> that she had met `` Colonel <PERSON> North </PERSON>, his wife, <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON>, and their four kids in Easter of 1983.'' When <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> asked her to describe the work pace, she responded that `` it was pretty crazy'' and that <PERSON> North </PERSON> would work at the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> late into the night while `` everyone else would be at home with their wife and family.'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> asked for a break after Hall, starting to tell a story about `` an American'' who `` was shot on the Honduran border,'' appeared unable to go on. It was the second interruption of the morning so that Ms. <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> could compose herself. Earlier, she requested a break after questioning from prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Keker </PERSON>, who kept referring to earlier testimony she had given to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and a grand jury. She told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and a federal grand jury in 1987 that <PERSON> North </PERSON> had specifically instructed her to retype memos detailing his deep involvement with the Contras. In front of the North jury, she said she recalled that he asked her to make changes. But she said `` I do n't remember the exact'' word, that it's `` very hard'' to remember what happened three years ago. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> led her gently through the document-shredding episode she had testified to before and asked her how long it took. `` I really do n't know,'' she said. `` I was not looking at the clock ... I was just doing my job. `` It was n't, lock door, pull down windows, pull down the shades,'' she added. It was no big deal.'' When she learned on Nov. 25, 1986, that then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had fired <PERSON> North </PERSON>, she said, `` I was very upset ... it was very unfair.'' Her testimony, which began in mid-afternoon Wednesday, was completed before noon and Miss <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> left the stand appearing weary. At one point during her testimony, Ms. <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> began talking at the same time as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>, who told her: `` Please keep your mouth shut while I am talking.'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> then admonished <PERSON> Keker </PERSON>, saying Ms. <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>'s earlier testimony was `` wholly consistent'' with her later statements. When <PERSON> Keker </PERSON> resumed questioning, she asked: `` Could I take a break?'' She stepped off the witness stand appearing distraught, and returned five minutes later. In grand jury testimony in March 1987, she said she deleted altered documents from her word processor. She told the North jury she was n't certain she did that. She testified in 1987 that she told <PERSON> North </PERSON> the day he was fired that she was smuggling documents out of the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> offices. She told the North jury she simply asked him whether he could see anything in her back. She testified in 1987 that she recalled <PERSON> North </PERSON> and lawyer <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> chuckling in the car after she pulled the smuggled documents out of her boots and back of her skirt on Nov. 25, 1986. She told the North jury that `` I do n't really have a recollection of that'' but acknowledged her earlier grand jury testimony was accurate. She insisted there was no agreement among her, <PERSON> North </PERSON> and another <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> staffer, Col. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Earl </PERSON>, `` to keep quiet'' about altered documents, shredding and smuggling papers out of the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> as the Iran-Contra affair came unraveled. She said that when the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Times ran a story on Thanksgiving Day 1986 saying there had been shredding at the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> offices, she was contacted by then-White House counsel, now <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney, <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>. `` I said that we shredded every day,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>. Asked whether she told <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> there had been an unusually large amount of shredding, she replied, `` I do n't believe I did.'' Asked whether she told <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> she had altered documents and smuggled some out of the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION>, she twice replied, `` No I did n't.'' Asked why she did n't tell <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> about the smuggled documents, she said, `` I do n't know. He may not have asked.'' In testimony Wednesday, Ms. <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> acknowledged that <PERSON> North </PERSON> joked about going to jail in 1985 when she typed false letters to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> denying that <PERSON> North </PERSON> was involved with the Contras. North now is charged with lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` Colonel <PERSON> North </PERSON> made jokes and there were jokes made about'' going to jail, <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> testified. `` He is one to jest often. ... He had a great sense of humor.'' Hall described how at North's instructions on Nov. 21, 1986, the day before the attorney general's aides began combing <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> files for evidence of the Iran-Contra affair, she altered several classified memos. The documents described <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s recommendations to his superiors on how to help the Contras, including providing aid to <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> after military officials there supplied phony end-user certificates for arms shipments to the Contras. The memos also referred to third-country assistance to the Contras and the possibility of seizing an arms shipment headed for <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Former national security adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> had raised questions about those memos with <PERSON> North </PERSON> in 1985, shortly before <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> signed the letters to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> containing denials of <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> assistance to the Contras.

<HEAD>Swiss Clear Way For U.S. To Request Extradition of Magharians</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERN, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Authorities today granted a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> request to detain two Lebanese brothers pending their extradition to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug trafficking charges. The brothers, <PERSON> Barkev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Magharian </PERSON>, are in custody in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> while prosecutors investigate allegations that the two laundered illegal drug profits through <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> banks and financial institutions. Under terms of a U.S.-Swiss extradition treaty, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities have 60 days to present a formal request for their extradition, said the <ORGANIZATION> Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Joerg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kistler </PERSON>. The two men were indicted in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> federal court in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on March 10 on charges of cocaine trafficking. They were also charged two days earlier in a federal court in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> with money laundering and the illegal export of capital.

<TEXT>
 When <PERSON> George </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> are traveling, the job of walking the first dog belongs to longtime family retainer <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON>, a shy, aw-shucks Texan who is known around the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> as `` Millie's best friend.'' <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> does n't see much these days of his pal <PERSON> Millie </PERSON>, the Bushes' 2-year-old English springer spaniel, because she is busy nursing her first litter of six puppies They were born last weekend with Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> serving as midwife. When the Bushes are home, the first lady feeds <PERSON> Millie </PERSON> herself and walks her around the White House South Lawn three or four times a day, <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> says. The president occasionally takes the first pooch along for an evening stroll around the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawn </LOCATION> after dinner. But when they're away, <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> finds <PERSON> Millie </PERSON> in the second-floor family quarters of the White House, pats her head, tosses an old tennis ball for her to retrieve _ her favorite game _ and takes her outside for some exercise. <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON>, 51, is a lifelong bachelor who lives in a small apartment on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. He's never owned a dog, yet he and <PERSON> Millie </PERSON> share that special sort of chemistry that produces strong bonds of affection and loyalty between man and dog. `` She always stops and wags her tail when she sees me coming,'' says <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON>, his voice as soft and gentle as the wind whispering through the piney woods of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` She's a very friendly dog,'' he said. `` She's nice to everybody, although she's sort of bashful with strangers. She likes to please people, so to speak. `` She's not a rambunctious dog. Some people's dogs start running and barking and jumping on you. She's just the opposite. She very seldom barks, unless she's shut away in a room. She's a little lady.'' <PERSON> Millie </PERSON>'s real name is <PERSON> Mildred </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerr </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, named after a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> friend of Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The dog was given to Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in February 1987 by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Farish </PERSON>, a wealthy <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> horse breeder and Republican supporter, shortly after the death of her beloved cocker spaniel, <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Millie </PERSON>'s first litter, five females and one male, was sired by <PERSON> Tug </PERSON> <PERSON> Farish </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, a year-old springer spaniel from the <PERSON> Farish </PERSON> farm at <LOCATION> Versailles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Millie </PERSON> was born. The puppies, like their parents, are white with liver-colored spots. <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> has been <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s loyal personal assistant for the past quarter-century. They met in 1964, when <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> was a student at <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> A & amp; M <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, campaigning unsuccessfully for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, gave a campus speech that <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> liked. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> hired the young campaign volunteer from <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> as a file clerk after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was elected to the House in 1966, and <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> has been on the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> payroll ever since. Nowadays, from a small office in the <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> handles the president's personal mail, pays his incidental bills and runs errands for the Bushes. `` I'm just a waterboy,'' he says with a smile. The Bushes, however, consider him a close friend. Last year, they invited <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> to join the family for Thanksgiving dinner at their <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, vacation home. <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> steadfastly refused to allow a photographer to take his picture posing with <PERSON> Millie </PERSON>, or even alone. `` I'm bashful, too,'' he said.

<HEAD>Judge Runs Out Of Jurors, Sends Deputy To Round Some Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAYWARD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Civic duty came as a shock to 12 people who were minding their own business in a courthouse when a burly deputy seized their driver's licenses and told them they were prospective jurors. `` I do n't mind jury duty, but the way it happened was rather frightening,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Croskrey </PERSON>, who with 11 other unhappy people was pressed into service at the order of <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartalini </PERSON> last week. <PERSON> Bartalini </PERSON> took the unusual step after he ran out of potential jurors in a murder case Thursday and he still needed two alternates to complete the jury roster. Invoking a rarely used law, the judge sent his deputy to go find some jury candidates. `` Let's say some were more understanding than others,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarnow </PERSON>, who told the recruits they could n't leave the building by an order of the court. <PERSON> Tarnow </PERSON> picked the 12 from a line at a window where tickets for traffic violations and other minor offenses are paid or assigned court dates. They were threatened with jail if they did n't come with him. <PERSON> Bartalini </PERSON> told them the case they might hear could take as long as a month. `` They were not happy to be there,'' said Assistant Public Defender <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON>. `` You could hear the breath whistling out of people.'' But the two who were eventually chosen as alternate jurors, and the other jurors who had been chosen earlier in the day, were thanked and sent home when they showed up for the trial Monday. The defendant had entered a last-minute plea of no contest to a lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter.

<TEXT>
 Short or long skirts, fitted or trapeze coats _ the fashion capital saw several silhouettes during the winter ready-to-wear fashion circus. As fashion sails into the 1990s, the passage may be a bit rough for women looking for direction and designers who do n't seem to know where to turn. But the good news is that individuals are truly free to choose their style, whether in pants and skirts or jackets and coats. And there is no evidence of designers conspiring to put women into stylishly ridiculous gear. Those fed up with the skirt-length dilemma may just abandon the skirt altogether and wear a beautiful hacking jacket or dressier model over opaque tights as <PERSON> Lagerfeld </PERSON> displayed at both his own and at the <ORGANIZATION> Chanel </ORGANIZATION> collection, with an elegant bow to the 1960s. Elsewhere, skirts were the familiar short lengths to just above the knee, or nearly ankle-length in trumpet shapes, pleated or handsome in a circle of leather at <ORGANIZATION> Ungaro </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacroix </PERSON> went his own eccentric way, showing softly feminine silhouettes and his favorite flowing trapeze styles. Some loved his loud patchwork looks for ready-to-wear; others were dazzled by his more expensive `` Luxe'' collection, shimmering with Byzantine splendor. Shoulders were softened or reduced to natural proportions in feminine silhouettes that marked the waist without undue emphasis. The new long jacket was gently fitted, sometimes with a martingale belting the back, while some were asymmetrical in front, or outlined in bold piping. Yet others appeared in swallow-tail or cutaway style. Snug spencers, battle jackets and boleros shared the honors for diminutive jacket styles. From the men's wardrobe but looking handsomely feminine were pinstriped bankers' suits at <PERSON> Hanae </PERSON> <PERSON> Mori </PERSON> and the straight tweed trousers pleated at the waist by master tailors <PERSON> Yves </PERSON> <PERSON> Saint </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jean-Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Scherrer </PERSON>. Long redingotes and short hooded duffel jackets looked terrific, but <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> also offers some handsome belted trenches, lounging coats or car coats in luxury cashmere or wool blends _ sometimes collared and lined with generous lashings of fur. Capes were a big item at Saint <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON> and <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, whose Little Red Riding Hood was a show-stealer. And Italians <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarlazzi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Romeo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gigli </PERSON> placed their models in cocoon coats. <PERSON> Gigli </PERSON>'s fabulous Byzantine-embroidered cocoon made news over his outfits in butterfly-light fabrics. The color spectrum zoomed from a range of darks _ especially chocolate brown and charcoal _ to autumnal <PERSON> Beaujolais </PERSON>, cognac, caramel, gold, mustard, olive, forest green, and misty shades of lavender and pink. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Montana </PERSON>'s collection brought out hues of blue, from glacier to deep petrol in his trouser suits. But there were hot colors, too, and those who love red will be happy, as every shade pepped up the runways, from garnet, fire-engine or poppy to orange-coral, fuchsia and magenta. The fabrics gave new softness to the clothes, with flecked tweeds, big and bold glen or windowpane grid plaids, looking peppy when placed on the diagonal. Butter-soft leather, calfskin or suede gave the appeal of luxury to many outfits _ remarkable when appliqued with arabesque designs on short Yves Saint Laurent jackets. A taste for exoticism ran to wild-animal prints, done in various styles and fabrics at <PERSON> Hanae </PERSON> <PERSON> Mori </PERSON>, <PERSON> Scherrer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lacroix </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>. But the only true furs seen were fox, vicuna, Mongolian lamb and mink. <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>'s mink was amazing, dyed in his favorite blues and ridged to look like chenille or corduroy. Otherwise coats looked appealingly warm in bright mohairs or Shetland. Wool and silk jerseys were used generously in softer styles _ especially in dresses, which made a modest comeback for day wear. Knits often had ethnic overtones, black and white at <ORGANIZATION> Chanel </ORGANIZATION>, startlingly bright at <PERSON> Lacroix </PERSON>. For late-day, the designers came up with some stunning cocktail suits or dresses with jackets _ all fit to sup at the Ritz. Among the most memorable: <ORGANIZATION> Chanel </ORGANIZATION>'s lightly fitted gold corduroy-ridged lame jacket over a satin-piped wrapped skirt topped with floppy satin bows. Black velvet gave opulent allure to day or evening clothes, and crimped panne or cut velvet added old-fashioned charm to much of the evening wear. In fact, fabrics for after sunset were so luxurious that they defined the lines of the outfit. Satin and slithery crepe de chine were favorites for slinky dinner gowns or pajamas. Black silk `` grain de poudre'' was used in all versions of the `` smoking'' or tuxedo style _ still a wardrobe staple, whether with pants or a skirt. Sheer chiffon revealed body lines, while iridescent taffeta lightly puffed around it in other models. Lame fabrics and embroidery made evening wear look bewitchingly shimmering, sometimes sexy, but never glitzy. And the lame brocades at houses like <PERSON> Hanae </PERSON> <PERSON> Mori </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lacroix </PERSON> and Saint <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON> shone with an extra dash of exoticism as the designers went at least partly to the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, Byzantium or <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> for inspiration.

 <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Fuji </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Photo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday they will jointly develop a new type of electronic camera that can show photos on TV monitors immediately after the picture is taken without processing. A similar camera was introduced by <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> last year, but the Toshiba-Fuji system is aimed to record images as digital signals, enabling easy transmission of pictures using personal computers and telephone lines. `` There are hundreds of advantages in the digitalized system,'' said <PERSON> Shozo </PERSON> <PERSON> Iijima </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION>'s chief engineer. `` The system will bring revolutionary changes in the field of still pictures.'' Digital electronic signals will be stored on a floppy disc inside the camera. Because it is recorded digitally, pictures can be stored in personal computers, <PERSON> Iijima </PERSON> said. The camera will be too costly for broad commercialization. `` The memory portion of the system involving semiconductors is too expensive with the current cost of microchips,'' <PERSON> Iijima </PERSON> said. `` So the main objective of our project is to lower the cost of the memory without reducing the quality of the picture.'' Officials of the two companies predicted the system will be available by 1990 for industrial use and by 1991 for commerical use. <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Fuji </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> also said they plan to call on other electronic and camera manufacturers to standarize the format of the digital camera system.

 A new tower will be built to replace the 900-year-old structure that collapsed last week, authorities announced Thursday.

City officials also announced they would inspect other medieval towers and monuments. A 501-year-old cathedral adjacent to the tower suffered substantial damage in the collapse. Experts said the collapse may have been caused by a sudden sinking following a three-month dry spell that lowered the water table. Others blamed natural decay in the mortar holding the bricks together.

<HEAD>Drought Holds GNP Growth to 2.4 Percent in Late '88</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The economy expanded at a moderate 2.4 percent annual rate in the last three months of 1988, the government reported Thursday, but analysts said the figure was held down by last summer's drought and masked strong underlying growth at year's end The increase in the gross national product, the broadest measure of economic health, would have been closer to 3.5 percent last quarter were it not for the drought, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. Analysts are divided over how much of that momentum extended into 1989, but most expect a slowdown as the aging economic expansion stretches through its seventh year. The fourth-quarter GNP figure was revised upward from an initial government estimate of 2 percent and contributed to growth of 3.9 percent for all of 1988, the best showing since a 6.8 percent increase in 1984. `` The upward revision underscores a banner year for the economy growthwise in 1988 and indicates the strong momentum that the economy carried over into 1989,'' said economist <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Inc.. Several recent government reports, however, have offered signs the economy already may be cooling off in response to efforts by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> to raise interest rates to dampen inflationary Retail sales, housing construction, orders for durable goods and factory operating rates all were down last month, while inflation remained above last year's levels. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> wants to slow growth to a more sustainable pace to reverse what <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> has called `` disturbing'' price increases, although some critics are afraid the central bank could go too far and push the country into a recession. Economist <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON> of the Wefa Group in <PERSON> Bala </PERSON> <PERSON> Cynwyd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, said the critical question is how significantly the economy is cooling, although it appears the nation is moving toward slower growth rather than an outright downturn. `` It's much too premature to conclude we're heading into a recession,'' <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s anti-inflation efforts and a trade deficit that is worsening as the export boom stalls both are expected to contribute to slower growth this year. GNP growth is likely to decline by more than a percentage point in 1989 to around 2.7 percent, analysts believe, despite an anticipated sharp upswing in the first quarter due to a rebound from the drought. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is counting on growth of 3.2 percent to help it reduce the federal budget deficit while adhering to the president's `` no new taxes'' campaign pledge. The government next month will release its initial estimate for GNP growth in the first quarter. Forecasters are pegging the figure at around 4.7 percent, with a 2.5 percentage-point boost from the farm rebound masking a broader economic slowdown. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, head of a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> consulting firm, said the economy could be particularly sluggish in the second half of this year, with the risk of recession running at about 40 percent. Nevertheless, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> had `` no choice but to tighten'' its grip on the money supply, given the troubling inflation numbers, <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. Some analysts warn the nation could experience a double negative this year if the economy cools but inflation fails to respond quickly to that slowdown. `` This may be the year in which real growth may be slowing while inflation is accelerating,'' said economist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Aubrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. An inflation index tied to the GNP rose at an annual rate of 5.3 percent in the October-December quarter, up from 4.7 percent in the third quarter Those figures represent high levels for the GNP deflator, which had risen at an annual rate of 3.8 percent or less for the last three years. Corporate profits, meanwhile, were up 2.8 percent in the fourth quarter and 14.6 percent for all of 1988, the government reported. Last year's increase was the biggest since a 22.4 percent post-recession jump in 1983. The upward revision in last quarter's GNP figure reflected higher government spending than earlier estimated and a smaller drop in business investment. Those gains were partially offset by a larger trade deficit as the gap between imports and exports grew at an annual rate of $ 11.5 billion during the quarter, the biggest widening in more than three years. Exports grew by 6.5 percent during the three-month period, but the increase was overwhelmed by a 13.5 percent rise in imports. The GNP's 2.4 percent rate of growth last quarter, held back by the drought, was the slowest advance since a 1.4 percent rise in the fourth quarter of 1986 and followed an increase of 2.5 percent in the third quarter, which also was affected by the drought. The economy expanded at a 3.4 percent clip in the first quarter of last year and at a 3 percent pace in the second.

<HEAD>Sonar Fails to Find Container of Insecticide In Channel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHERBOURG, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Authorities searching the English Channel for a container of deadly insecticide detected an object on sonar, but it turned out to be a block of reinforced concrete, the navy said Thursday. The container was lost when the <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> ship Perintis sank in a storm March 13 northwest of the <LOCATION> Channel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. Ecologists say that if the containeer spills its six tons of toxic Lindane insecticide, it could cause an ecological disaster with dire consequences for the next 30 years. Lindane is used widely by European farmers, and small amounts routinely wash down the rivers to the sea. But large amounts of it would kill fish. Two French navy mine sweepers have been searching for the container in sometimes heavy seas, and their sonar detected an object similar to the container Wednesday. But two mini-submarines determined the object lying in 400 feet of water near a World War II ammunition dump was a block of concrete. <ORGANIZATION> Rhone-Poulenc </ORGANIZATION>, which manufactures Lindane in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, says it would not dissolve easily in the cold waters of the channel. It is also well packed in strong plastic sacks inside the reinforced container, company officials said. The French government said small quantities of Lindane had been traced in waters near the mouth of the <LOCATION> Seine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> but added that these were normal and well below limits allowed in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The container was originally retrieved with five others from the wreck of the Perintis by the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> navy, but the container was lost again when tow ropes snapped as it was being hauled back to <LOCATION> Cherbourg </LOCATION> port.

 Arriving at last year's Academy Awards was a feature-length disaster starring some of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s biggest names. This year, some of the biggest names in city traffic control say there will be no sequel. Limousines making their way to the 1988 awards ceremony at the Shrine Auditorium came to a dead stop in sweltering smog, many blocks short of their destination. For hours they sat motionless in a high-glamour gridlock as the clock ticked toward the televised show's opening credits. Acting nominee and presenter <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Close </PERSON>, nine months pregnant, finally emerged from her limo and hiked up <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION> to make the ceremony on time. Others followed suit, among them Olivia de Havilland and Meryl Streep. `` I saw quite a few gorgeous women holding their skirts with one hand and high-heel shoes with the other, out of breath and trying to get in on time,'' said official Oscar greeter Army Archerd. `` Hundreds of dollars in hairdressing and makeup were ruined because they had to run in the broiling sun,'' he said. A tribute to <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON>'s 60th birthday, presenting nominees from all 59 previous ceremonies, had to be scratched because so many principals were late. `` It was a nightmare,'' said Dav-El Limousines chauffeur <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON>. `` We actually rehearsed the drive the day before, but we had no idea it would be as bad as it was.'' He said he arrived with moments to spare. Another celebrity who got stuck was <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>. Needless to say, things will be done a little differently this year. Within days of last year's debacle, a team of traffic experts began work to assure a smooth street performance for the 61st Academy Awards next Wednesday, said <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowder </PERSON>, a city traffic engineer who handles special events. The team concluded there were several problems, including too many vehicles trying to squeeze through narrow Royal Street at the front of the auditorium to unload their passengers in a timely fashion. Among the changes this year is a different celebrity arrival area with five lanes to accommodate the big cars. The number of traffic officers will be nearly doubled from last year, <PERSON> Crowder </PERSON> said, along with street engineers trained to rearrange traffic patterns while an event is occurring. Officials also will use Automatic Traffic Surveillance and Control, a system linked by fiber optics to a centralized computer to adjust signal lights. The system was installed in the area for the 1984 Summer Olympics. <PERSON> Crowder </PERSON> said officials expect 500 to 800 limousines for Oscar night, along with 800 passenger cars. Inside the auditorium will be 5,700 guests, another 550 people devoted to production of the live 9 p.m. EST broadcast on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>, and about 150 Academy personnel. `` The city does not look good when things like this happen,'' <PERSON> Crowder </PERSON> said of last year's traffic jam. `` This is the home of the film industry, and we do n't want to lose something like the Oscars to somewhere else.''

<HEAD>Track Star Lewis Calls for Random Steroid Testing</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Track superstar <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said Thursday it was his `` guess'' that as many as 10 Olympic medals last summer went to athletes using anabolic steroids, and he urged random testing at all levels of sports competition. `` We want to elevate ourselves ethically to the point where everyone sacrifices ourselves to make the sport clean,'' the three-time Olympian and winner of six gold medals told a congressional subcommittee. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> received a gold medal in the 100-meter dash at last summer's Olympics in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> after the first contestant to cross the finish line, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, tested positive for anabolic steroids, compounds that develop strength and speed but which are banned as dangerous drugs. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> told members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s crime subcommittee he felt certain that other medal winners also were steroid users. `` I would say at least five to 10 if I had to guess ... and some of those were gold medals,'' said <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, in answer to a question from Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> McCollum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Fla </LOCATION>. Members of the subcommittee, which is weighing proposed legislation to ban mail-order steroids, did not ask <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> the names of other users who may have won medals He ducked the question when reporters asked him after the hearing. `` That's not the issue,'' he said. `` The issue is that it should be zero.'' He departed from the view of a number of other athletes as well as civil liberties group when asked about testing. `` I think we're getting to the point where we have to randomly,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. `` It's at every level.'' He also called for investigation of coaches who may be working with steroid suppliers and forcing athletes to use the substances. He said some coaches deliberately train athletes the wrong way if they refuse to take the drugs as a way of prodding them to do so. Other coaches may be slipping steroids into the vitamins of the athletes under their supervision, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. He did say that most coaches and athletes shun steroids but that the problem is growing and the sports world should be more outspoken about it. In turn, lawmakers paid homage to <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> for his own candor. `` In a world in which that is a rare commodity, I hope that you are never bludgeoned into verbal submission,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Romano </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazzoli </PERSON>, D-Ky. Rep. <PERSON> Fortney </PERSON> -LRB- Pete -RRB- Stark, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., sponsor of the legislation, told the subcommittee it was necessary to tell prospective buyers that `` their is no prescription pharmacy in your mailbox

<TEXT>
 The government on Thursday appealed for $ 28.5 million in international aid to rebuild roads, bridges, buildings and water systems damaged this month by floods, an earthquake and a cyclone. The money was urgently needed for initial damage repairs, and more will be necessary later for emergency food supplies and long-term reconstruction, the state <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disaster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preparedness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relief </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said. About 115,000 people were left homeless by torrential rain, the earthquake and a cyclone that struck during a 10-day period earlier this month. An unspecified number of people were killed. About three-fourths of the $ 28.5 million will be used to rebuild damaged homes and public buildings, and to repair bridges, roads and water systems, said <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Upinde </PERSON>, the vice chairman of the disaster commmittee. Some of the aid will provide blankets, mats and cooking utensils for disaster victims, he told reporters. <PERSON> Emmanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gondwe </PERSON>, the government's secretary for district administration and rural development, said an international appeal for food will be launched when authorities have assessed the full extent of losses of crops and livestock. Disaster victims are being fed with emergency food stocks intended for 350,000 people in northern <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION> whose crops were affected by a plant disease, <PERSON> Gondwe </PERSON> said. The food will soon have to be replenished, he said, and other appeals later will seek aid for long-term rebuilding and replanting in devastated farmlands. Among the victims are some of the 650,000 refugees who have fled the war in neighboring <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>. On Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crescent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Societies </ORGANIZATION> launched a separate appeal in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> for $ 1.5 million for disaster victims.

 <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said Thursday the second formal meeting between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> representatives was positive and reflected the desire of both sides to make the dialogue a success. To a reporter who asked the smiling chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> whether Wednesday's meeting was responsible for his good mood, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> replied: `` Yes, exactly.'' He described the content of the meeting between <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Abed-Rabbo </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> executive committee as `` positive and serious,'' but gave few details of the discussion. `` There is a mutual interest and intention to lead this dialogue to success,'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON> and <PERSON> Abed-Rabbo </PERSON> met for 4 -LCB- hours at the Tunisian government's Dar el Maghreibia guest house, with two senior advisers present on each side. The ambassador would not talk about the meeting and referred all inquiries to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said: `` No one has the right to say what they asked of us or what we asked of them.'' Did the Americans ask him to stop the 15-month-old uprising in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> that has taken the lives of more than 400 Palestinians? `` No one presented such a request and no one can ask a people to stop resisting an occupation,'' he replied. It was the second formal meeting since talks began in December, after <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> publicly renounced terrorism and recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist There was no indication whether a third meeting was scheduled, but the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief's mood suggested the dialogue will continue. `` The fact that the agenda was loaded with a lot of subjects to be discussed shows clearly the importance given to it both by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. `` Its importance is even greater if you take into consideration all the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> efforts to stop it.'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> reiterated his demand for an international peace conference on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> with the participation of the nations involved, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and the five permanent members of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>: the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. `` This is the position announced by the Arab summits in <LOCATION> Casablanca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> and it is very similar and parallel to the European, Soviet, Chinese and non-aligned position on the same issue,'' he said. `` The American administration is in principle for an international conference, but says it should be very well prepared.'' Asked about reports that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> would consider the possibility of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers replacing the Israelis in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said: `` We accept <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> forces under the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> flag to replace the Israeli army in the territory, but I never mentioned the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Army.'' On Wednesday, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s spokesman <PERSON> Bassam </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> said <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers could play a transitional role and help oversee free elections in an independent Palestinian state. To a question about Palestinian measures to reduce tension in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said it should be addressed to the Israelis because `` it is they who are causing tension, with the Israeli army and the armed settler groups using force against the Palestinians.'' `` The essential question is whether the Israeli army and air force will stop bombarding villages and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> camps in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>,'' he said. He was asked about the unexplained delay in organizing an exile Palestinian government and said the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> wanted to include representatives of Palestinians living inside Palestine, which includes <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` We need to know how the Israelis will react to those who are appointed,'' he said. `` Will they deport them, or put them in jail, or put them to death?'' The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which acts as the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> legislature, declared Palestinian independence last November. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s readiness to deal with Palestinians outside the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>: `` According to an internal rule of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, there is not a single Palestinian who is not in the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>.'' He will let <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> name the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> delegates to an international conference, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said, `` if <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will not object to me naming the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> delegation.''

<HEAD>Arkansas Legislature Acts To Remove Vestiges of Segregation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than three decades after fighting federally ordered integration, the <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> took a series of landmark steps to shed the state's segregrationist past. The keystone of the legislative session concluded last week was the approval of a $ 118 million settlement in a lingering civil rights lawsuit stemming from state and local actions that the plaintiffs said helped resegregate inner-city schools in <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> and encourage `` white flight'' to the suburbs. The settlement includes beefing up city schools and redrawing some school district boundaries. `` A national statement for desegregation was made today,'' <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> school board member <PERSON> Skip </PERSON> <PERSON> Rutherford </PERSON> said after the state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> narrowly approved the settlement. `` It was a clear determination on the part of a majority of the legislators to put the legacy of 1957 behind us forever,'' Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> said in an interview this week. It was 1957 when then-Gov. <PERSON> Orval </PERSON> <PERSON> Faubus </PERSON> refused to allow nine black students to enter the all-white Central High School. President <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> ordered federal troops to Central to keep the peace and enforce court-ordered desegregation. In addition to approving the settlement, lawmakers this session voted overwhelmingly to repeal more than a dozen laws passed during the late 1950s and early 1960s to preserve segregated schools. One statute required local school officials to consider public sentiment in making school assignments. Another provided for jailhouse school board meetings in case board members were jailed for disobeying integration orders. A co-sponsor of the legislation to repeal the segregation laws was freshman Rep. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> McGee </PERSON>, the first black since Reconstruction to represent the largely black <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delta </LOCATION> region of eastern <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>. `` What's historic about the whole thing was the commitment on the part of people to wipe the slate clean,'' said <PERSON> McGee </PERSON>, who noted that some of the votes to repeal the segregation laws came from lawmakers who had helped adopt them years ago. Lawmakers also decided to put on the November ballot a measure asking voters to repeal a 1956 amendment to the state constitution that required the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> to pass laws and use all other means necessary to circumvent federal desegregation rulings. Any state or local official could be prosecuted for failure to enforce state laws to preserve segregation. <PERSON> Faubus </PERSON>, now 79, said this week that repealing the old laws and attempting to amend the constitution is commendable but unnecessary. `` All those things had been nullified by the federal court rulings,'' he said. `` I'm not objecting to it, but I think it's mostly posturing and for propaganda purposes. <PERSON> Faubus </PERSON> does object to the settlement involving the <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pulaski </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Special school districts. `` It may turn out as one of the worse things that ever happened,'' said <PERSON> Faubus </PERSON>, who served six terms as governor. `` This could break the state government. There's no limit to what it could cost, and there's no limit to how many lawsuits that can be filed. These lawyers are making too much money to let it stop.'' <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> calls the agreement a model for other states grappling with desegregation issues, and he and other proponents argue it could buffer the state from liability in any future desegregation litigation. At least two such lawsuits are pending. Lawmakers from outside <LOCATION> Pulaski </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> _ <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> and the surrounding area _ were angry that money earmarked for schools in their districts will be funneled into the <LOCATION> Pulaski </LOCATION> schools, among the state's wealthiest. Rep. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON> called the settlement an open-ended `` entitlement program'' that ultimately could cost the state more than $ 260 million. In addition to the money the state agreed to pay in the settlement, court orders in the case require the state to fund other compensatory programs in the <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> district and pay $ 9.3 million a year for the operation of magnet schools designed to attract white students back to the <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> district. Also approved were programs _ such as mandatory kindergarten and college grants to entice more minority students into teaching _ drafted to benefit blacks. The state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> easily approved the settlement, 31-2. But it took four ballots in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> before the agreement finally passed, 54-42, just 30 minutes before the 68-day session ended Friday. Of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members who changed their votes in the final ballot, <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> said: `` They concluded that the old tried-and-true Southern strategy of whipping up on the federal courts had never worked for anybody _ that it would generate a lot of votes but never show any positive results in the civil rights area.'' He complimented the legislators from outside <LOCATION> Pulaski </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> for voting for the settlement. `` We are trying to close the books on the Little Rock crisis and essentially make a statement that we're committed to equal opportunity, to giving all of our children a chance to learn, and that we're committed to a progressive course in education, economic development and race relations,'' <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> said. `` We have to deal with all of those things if this state and its people are ever going to fulfill their potential.''

 A young man was charged today with murdering a 13-year-old neighbor girl found stabbed and strangled three weeks ago in the basement of the home he shares with his parents and teen-age brother. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Golub </PERSON>, 21, surrendered to police and was ordered held without bail. `` This defendant is charged with the vicious, savage killing of a 13-year-old girl,'' Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Cotter </PERSON> argued at the arraignment. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinyes </PERSON>, whose daughter, <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, was slain, stood quietly in a courtroom hallway. County Chief of Detectives <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Seay </PERSON> said <PERSON> Golub </PERSON>'s arrest was based on `` significant and substantial forensic evidence,'' which <PERSON> Cotter </PERSON> said included a bloody palm print found at the murder scene in <PERSON> Golub </PERSON>'s basement. <PERSON> Golub </PERSON>, a muscular, 5-foot-3 weightlifter, maintains his innocence, his attorney, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Grady </PERSON>, said. Neighbors and relatives of the girl, angry that police had not made an arrest, had driven the Golubs from their house in <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stream </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> earlier this week. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> had been seen entering the <PERSON> Golub </PERSON> house on March 3 after reportedly receiving a phone call from <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 14. Police had said the <PERSON> Golub </PERSON> brothers, both of whom were at home on the afternoon of the killing, were the main focus of their investigation. Police announced last week that they had enough evidence to make an arrest, but District Attorney <PERSON> Denis </PERSON> <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON> said he wanted to present the case to a grand jury to strengthen it. The grand jury heard testimony Wednesday.

 Charges of resisting arrest have been dropped against a black policeman whose head shattered a plate glass window in a confrontation with a white officer that was videotaped by a news crew. `` I'm very elated,'' <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, 30, said after the prosecutor announced there was not enough evidence to bring him to trial Wednesday. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Hawthorne </LOCATION> police sergeant who has accused white officers of racism, set up his own `` sting'' by traveling into nearby <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> on Jan. 14 in a car while an NBC news crew followed. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s vehicle was pulled over by police. In a scene later televised on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s head is seen apparently being smashed into a store window. The city filed charges of resisting arrest. On Wednesday, Deputy City Prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vander </PERSON> <PERSON> Lans </PERSON> told Municipal Judge <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> there was insufficient evidence to obtain a conviction. <PERSON> Vander </PERSON> <PERSON> Lans </PERSON> said he based his decision on the videotape; the testimony by the arresting officer, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickey </PERSON>, during a state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hearing, and interviews with witnesses. Police said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s car had been weaving in traffic, and officials had suggested <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> instigated the confrontation through his words and actions. But <PERSON> Dickey </PERSON> told the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had never sworn at him as he had stated in his police report. The officer attributed the discrepancy to a faulty memory. After the charge was dismissed, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> denounced <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> authorities' attempt to prosecute him as `` a ridiculous spectacle.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is on disability leave from the <PERSON> Hawthorne </PERSON> department because he contends he suffered stress as a result of racism there. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Minton </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Officers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, criticized the decision to drop the case `` The Don Jacksons of the world are going to go out there and try to intimidate police officers, and somebody is going to get hurt,'' he said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beck </PERSON>, said he has filed a complaint with the state bar against <PERSON> Vander </PERSON> <PERSON> Lans </PERSON> alleging malicious prosecution and claimed city officials conspired against <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Vander </PERSON> <PERSON> Lans </PERSON> denied the charge.

 This small eastern <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> town has done without one of the more common trappings of the modern world for 113 years _ a paved Main Street. But Crooks residents voted Tuesday to cover up the past by approving a $ 70,000 project that will put pavement on Main. Work to lay the asphalt carpet will begin this spring on the 2 -LCB- blocks made up of mud and gravel. `` You bet it's a big deal,'' Mayor <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` One of the things we've found is when we go out and try to lure a business into Crooks, a paved Main Street is a priority.'' Crooks, located about 10 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, began as a settlement called New Hope in 1876. The town changed its name in 1904 to honor the then-postmaster and banker D.O. Crooks. Although most of the town's 750 residents work in <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, there are about a dozen businesses and <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said he would like to attract more. `` It seems to have an effect on the general feeling of the community as a whole,'' he said. `` A lot of people come and drive through and they wo n't stop.'' Residents approved a $ 20,000 bond issue to help pay for the project 100-47.

She said she had seen crawfish before, but `` never that big.'' Her biggest challenge with the costume was finding a place through which its inhabitant could breathe and see. She settled on the crawfish's mouth. `` Crawford'' will be featured in the fourth annual Crawfish Festival parade April 29.

<HEAD>National Head Count Could Cost $3 Billion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Next year's national head count could cost $ 3 billion, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was told Thursday. But <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> officials doubt they'll have to spend quite that much. `` We estimate that the 1990 census will cost about $ 2.6 billion,'' deputy census director <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Kincannon </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> census subcommittee. But <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodaro </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> told the subcommittee he believes the bureau is underestimating the cost. `` On the basis of continued inflation and more current cost estimates, we believe that the 1990 census, as planned, will cost about $ 3 billion,'' <PERSON> Dodaro </PERSON> testified. <PERSON> Kincannon </PERSON> responded that `` factors outside our control, such as lower than expected mail-return rates or productivity, could increase costs,'' but added that `` we do not expect that to happen.'' The 1980 national head count eventually cost $ 1.1 billion. Initial estimates had been lower. More than 100 million census forms will be mailed a year from now, with the constitutionally mandated count scheduled for April 1, 1990. `` Political representation and money are allocated based on census results and the data are used for planning at every level of government and in the private sector,'' <PERSON> Kincannon </PERSON> pointed out. He and <PERSON> Dodaro </PERSON> agreed that a major problem will be recruiting the estimated 480,000 temporary workers the bureau is expected to need to do the counting. In test counts last year, <PERSON> Kincannon </PERSON> said, the bureau found that its planned wage range of $ 5.50 to $ 6 an failed to attract workers in some areas. Thus, he said, officials are developing a regional pay scale keyed to local costs and salaries. Even so, with many two-earner families, fewer people are available to recruit for these temporary jobs. Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridge </PERSON>, R-Pa., suggested one possible solution would be to recruit census enumerators from among retired federal workers around the country, if rules can be changed to allow them to be paid without reducing their retirement benefits <PERSON> Dodaro </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kincannon </PERSON> supported that idea. Ridge and Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, said they were introducing legislation to allow the retirees to take these temporary jobs without benefit cuts. <PERSON> Kincannon </PERSON> also said major efforts are underway to better count the homeless and minorities. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> launched its effort to encourage Hispanics to be counted. With the census numbers used to apportion seats in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, state legislatures and other governing bodies, many minority groups will be encouraging members to participate in the count. `` Hagase contar,'' or `` Make Yourself Count,'' is the slogan of the Mexican-American effort.

 It takes courage, heart and brains to take on <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Garland </PERSON> and the Wicked Witch of the West. But producer-director <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grilikhes </PERSON> -LRB- `` Disney on Parade'' -RRB- has attempted to do so with a live road show of `` The Wizard of Oz,'' which opened Wednesday night at Radio City Music Hall and will visit 70 cities after it leaves <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> April 9. The $ 7.5 million production features flying monkeys and sparkling human snowflakes, a fire-throwing evil witch, a computerized Yellow Brick Road and a house that chugs along an overhead dolly. But with all the stage gimmicks and pyrotechnics, it's a long, slow trip to <LOCATION> Emerald </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Grilikhes </PERSON>, who spent 12 years trying to adapt the 1939 film classic version of the <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Baum </PERSON> stories, closely follows the film script and includes all the <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> and E.Y. <PERSON> Harburg </PERSON> songs from the original. But the staging is stiff, the pacing slow and the direction falters. Still, it is a delightful event for families, and in those communities without repertory companies or little theaters, the production is a wonderful way to introduce children to live performances. However those under 3 might grow restless by the time <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON>, the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodsman and the Cowardly Lion reach the Witch's castle. The story opens in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, of course, with a set as flat as the plains. Fourteen-year-old <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> lives on a farm with her Auntie Em and Uncle <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> and three lovable farm hands. Her little dog, Toto, takes a nip out of mean spinster, <LOCATION> Miss </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulch </LOCATION>, who takes the pooch off to be dispatched to that great dog pound in the sky. Toto escapes, finds <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> and they run away from home. She meets Prof. Marvel who persuades her to return home. She does, just as a tornado is twisting through the landscape. The house is lifted by wires to a figure-eight dolly on the dome of the Music Hall, where it totters slowly over part of the orchestra like a car on a ferris wheel. The effect does n't work. There is no brutal force _ even the sound effects and lighting are limp. The house crashes on the Wicked Witch of the East, <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> meets Glinda the good witch, gets the bad witch's ruby slippers and heads off to <LOCATION> Emerald </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to see the Wizard so she can be sent home. As <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON>, the diminutive 23-year-old <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> <PERSON> Grieg </PERSON> is appealing, but her singing voice is thin as she attempts `` Somewhere Over the Rainbow,'' and the supposedly tiny Munchkins tower above her. She was spotted by <PERSON> Grilikhes </PERSON> while appearing as Snow White in a <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> production of `` Beach Blanket Babylon.'' <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonough </PERSON> is no <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolger </PERSON> but does a splendid job as the Scarecrow. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuffre </PERSON>'s Tin Man is less inspirational but adequate <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> is lovable as the Lion. <PERSON> Polly </PERSON> <PERSON> Feale </PERSON> rivals <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> as Miss Gulch and the Wicked Witch. In many respects, she's even more sinister. <PERSON> Bart </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> is the Wizard, Prof. Marvel and the guard at <LOCATION> Emerald </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Toto _ actually five trained terriers _ appears and disappears with great frequency. `` The Wizard of Oz'' includes a cast of 42 performers, huge sets and computer robotics. But one of the most interesting effects in the show is a simple piece of theatrics. When the witch melts, she flattens herself down a staircase, unseeen by the audience. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>'s costumes are a whimsical treat, especially the ornate Munchkin attire. The Yellow Brick Road, though, is a disappointment. It's difficult to see, and just sort of pops up every now and then. <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> and crew half-heartedly trot along.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has warned <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines of a possible hijack attempt by Palestinian terrorists in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said today. But officials at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> denied a report today in the tabloid <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats and military personnel had been notified of the warning. They also denied that the warning said the hijacking could occur over Easter weekend. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, which is in charge of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, said it was aware of the warning but did not pass it along to military personnel. The spokesman, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Maj. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinkham </PERSON>, spoke with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Stuttgart </LOCATION> and refused to elaborate. The front-page <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> report came during a political debate in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> over whether airlines were properly informed about a radio-cassette bomb before <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103, a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 bound for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, was blown apart over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, Dec. 21, killing 270 people. Airports in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> stepped up security after receiving the warning, but no additional precautions were reported today at airports in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. The White House press secretary, <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, said today the warning was issued March 16 and that it was `` similar to many, many similar kinds of information and security bulletins that go out.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that `` it was not given to any military or diplomatic personnel but rather just to security experts at aviation airports and airlines.'' The notice did not mention any specific time period, such as Easter, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, nor did it mention a specific airline or airport. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that the security bulletin was issued to provide information to air carriers and airports about `` the possibility of a hijacking of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airliner in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said the bulletin was sensitive information not designed for public distribution. `` The release of this information by unauthorized persons can be counterproductive to the civil aviation community's efforts to provide a totally effective security system,'' the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said the bulletin did not refer to a time period or name an airline or airport, nor was there any reference to the Eastern Holiday period. It said no warning was issued to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government employees. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Calder </PERSON>, a spokesman at the embassy press office in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> passed on the warning to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> and to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> today, officials said the West German <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government offices were notified of a threatened terrorist attack but that they did not issue a warning to the public. Flight 103 originated in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. An <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Bachmeier </PERSON>, said <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> authorities received `` a vague warning'' that a hijack threat had been made, but declined to give any details of the threat or how it was received. In another development, <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> today showed videotape taken by three youths who said they were able to board an empty <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet at <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> on Monday without being challenged. The video included a shot of one youth sitting in the captain's seat in the cockpit. `` They say they are cracking down on security and they are confident no one else can do what happened at <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>,'' said one of the youths, identified only as <PERSON> Shoaib </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>. `` It is just not true.'' <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement it regarded the incident as `` extremely serious'' and was investigating. The <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> tabloid the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> said the possible hijack threat was detailed in a secret memorandum dated March 17 from the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>. The paper said it had been given a copy of the memorandum. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement: `` We do n't discuss security matters. The <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> said: `` American military personnel and diplomats and their families have been told of the threat, which centers on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines. They were advised to alter routine plans to return home from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> for Easter.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> memo `` warns all airlines and security forces in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the rest of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. It was passed to the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'' It quotes `` security sources'' as saying a copy of the memo arrived at the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> offices of <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION>, a company owned by <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>.'' The Daily Express printed part of the memorandum, which read in part: `` Possible: 3 Lebanese Palestinians may try to hijack a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airliner in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> believes it obtained enough radio telemetry from this week's failed Trident 2 missile launch to determine the precise cause, but already suspects a fault in the rocket nozzle system of the first stage motor, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s chief spokesman said Thursday. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, the spokesman, said a preliminary investigation suggests either an electrical or mechanical glitch in the part of the missile that swivels the rocket nozzles from side to side. `` And we do believe that we have the necessary data to be able to evaluate it and pinpoint the problem, even without the recovery of the vehicle,'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. `` We do have further launches scheduled. At this point, there are no plans to delay or alter that planned launch program. And we still expect that the Trident 2 will be fully operational aboard the USS Tennessee in December.'' The investigation began Tuesday, shortly after a Trident 2 missile fired from the submarine <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> self-destructed four seconds after launch. The missile popped to the surface as planned and the first stage ignited properly, but the missile then began spinning like a burning pinwheel and exploded. It was the first submarine launch of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s newest and most powerful weapon. According to <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, the missile's first-stage rocket nozzles are supposed to swivel immediately after firing to put the weapon on a 19-degree angle of flight. Another internal command is then sent to the nozzles to straighten back up, thus maintaining the missile's 19-degree angle In this case, the spokesman, the radio telemetry discloses the second command to the nozzles to straighten was sent but not executed. `` They do not know yet whether the difficulty is in the electrical system, that that signal did not get from the sending point to the receiving point, or if the difficulty was simply mechanical, that a pump did n't operate correctly or whatever,'' he continued. `` In any event, -LRB- the nozzles -RRB- did not correct. So the missile continued in that pitchover maneuver, round and round in circles. And as it did so, it generated G-forces internal to the missile,'' triggering a self-destruct safety system, he said. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> declined to predict how long it would take technicians to isolate the cause of the failure. The three-stage Trident 2 is a more lethal version of the weapon that is the heart of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s naval nuclear deterrent, the Trident 1. The new missile can deliver three to 12 nuclear warheads to individual targets up to 6,000 miles away. The Trident 1 experienced similar test failures but still was deployed on schedule, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> noted Thursday. After 19 test launches, the Trident 1 had worked only 13 times compared to 16 for the Trident 2, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> says the new weapon is much more accurate than its undersea predecessors _ <ORGANIZATION> Polaris </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Poseidon </PERSON> and Trident 1 _ and can match the targeting ability of land-based missiles even though it is launched from a submerged, moving submarine. The <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> is the first of nine submarines equipped to carry 24 of the deadly missiles.

 Vietnamese refugees said Thursday about 130 countrymen drowned two weeks ago when their overloaded 30-foot wooden boat capsized and sank near a Japanese tanker in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. Japanese authorities said first reports of the March 8 accident did not emerge until Monday, when 35 survivors of the accident on the high seas between <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> arrived in the port of <LOCATION> Yokohama </LOCATION>. News agencies in <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> said Thursday that floating bodies were sighted off <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>. It was the latest reported accident involving the increasing number of Vietnamese fleeing political repression and economic hardship in the communist country. The refugees, known as boat people, risk piracy and disaster in hopes of achieving asylum and permanent resettlement outside <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. Surviving refugees said the boat collided with the 239,000-ton Nissei-Maru and sank, but the tanker's captain said he believed a wave capsized the boat. Survivors said their boat was carrying 165 people. A <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION> refugee center official, <PERSON> Masanami </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakatsukasa </PERSON>, said the boat had left Long An in southern <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> on March 4. Many passengers were seasick and were suffering from a lack of fresh water after four days at sea, and they had been trying to approach the tanker for help, the official quoted survivors as saying. `` The tanker came very close to our boat, and the waves pushed us into the ship,'' survivor <PERSON> Chan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kan </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> late Thursday. `` Our boat capsized. The children and others trapped in the boat were drowned,'' <PERSON> Chan </PERSON> said. The boat overturned and sank after hitting the propeller at the back of the Nissei-Maru, the refugee official quoted survivors as saying. The tanker captain, <PERSON> Yasuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kawamura </PERSON>, had stopped and prepared ladders to take the refugees on board. He said in a TV interview that the reason for the sinking was unclear. `` I could n't see it with my own eyes, but we were completely stopped, so I do n't think we hit the boat,'' <PERSON> Kawamura </PERSON> said. `` I think their boat was capsized when it was hit broadside by a wave.'' <PERSON> Hiroshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hattori </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tanker </ORGANIZATION>, the <PERSON> Nissei-Maru </PERSON>'s agent, also denied reports of a collision He said the tanker crew did not know how many refugees were missing after the accident. Reports that 165 refugees had been crammed into the boat were `` unbelievable,'' said <PERSON> Seichiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Okamoto </PERSON>, head of ocean operations for <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> Tanker. The Nissei-Maru conducted an all-day search and rescued 35 refugees, then sailed for <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, where the refugees were refused entry, news reports said. The refugees were brought to <LOCATION> Yokohama </LOCATION> on another Japanese vessel after <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> granted them entry, said <PERSON> Chikako </PERSON> <PERSON> Saito </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> High Commissioner for Refugees in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Maritime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Kazuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Numata </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tanker </ORGANIZATION> had not mentioned any missing, reporting only the rescue of 35 refugees. The agency, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s coast guard, will send officials to the refugee center where the 35 survivors are staying to investigate the accident, <PERSON> Numata </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Saito </PERSON> said the refugees will become Japanese residents unless they have close relatives in third countries. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Taizo </PERSON> <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON> said his ministry viewed the case as `` a really serious issue,'' but could not comment until the <ORGANIZATION> coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> guard </ORGANIZATION> completed its investigation. In <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, decomposed bodies sighted by fishermen in the seas off northeast <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> were believed to be those of the refugees, police said. The body of a girl found on a northeast <LOCATION> Malaysian </LOCATION> beach Tuesday also is believed to be one of the drowned refugees, <LOCATION> Trengganu </LOCATION> state Police Chief <PERSON> Wan </PERSON> <PERSON> Razak </PERSON> <PERSON> Muda </PERSON> told the national news agency <ORGANIZATION> Bernama </ORGANIZATION>. There are 16,500 Vietnamese refugees in Malaysian camps, more than 750 who arrived since March 14, <ORGANIZATION> Bernama </ORGANIZATION> said. Last year, more than 45,000 boat people landed in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> countries, compared with fewer than 30,000 in 1987. Under a new policy by the Association of Southern Asian nations, recently arrived boat people will be put into temporary camps and screened to determine if they are genuine refugees fleeing for political purposes or just economic refugees seeking a better life in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. The economic refugees are returned to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. So far no one has been deported from <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials also are trying to stem to exodus. They plan to stress the advantages of the 10-year-old `` Orderly Departure Program,'' under which 23,000 people were flown from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> last year, most for resettlement in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>.

 Senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> said Thursday that he skipped the opening session of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s legislature so he could `` conserve my health and live longer. In his first public appearance since the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> opened Monday, he also acknowledged the government has made mistakes, such as not paying enough attention to education and forgetting its tradition of hard work and plain living `` I seldom do the daily work -LRB- of government -RRB- now,'' <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> told visiting Ugandan President <PERSON> Yoweri </PERSON> <PERSON> Museveni </PERSON>. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, 84, did not attend even though he is a delegate to the congress from his home province, <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION>. Government officials said only that <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> had asked for leave. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> confirmed to <PERSON> Museveni </PERSON>: `` I have asked for leave. I want to conserve my health and live longer. What is more important is that I should gradually withdraw from the stage and let others preside over the work.'' He noted new government and party leaders were chosen in 1987 and 1988. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> retired from all his posts except that of chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which sets military policy. `` We should not let the new leaders feel that there is a kind of force above them,'' <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> said. `` Yes, but young people need the guidance and leadership of the older generation,'' <PERSON> Museveni </PERSON> responded. In a later report by the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> was quoted as saying the government has made small mistakes in the last 10 years during which <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has enacted a reform program to open its economy to market forces. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is facing an inflation rate of 36 percent, the highest since the communist victory in 1949. Corruption also is on the rise. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> said it would take the country two to four years to overcome the problems. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> said Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> had referred to the mistakes in his report Monday to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` Foreigners have commented that we have made self-criticisms about these mistakes. We veterans, too have to take responsibility,'' he said. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> chain smokes despite doctors' advice to cut down. He wears a hearing aid in one ear and moves more slowly than he did several years ago, but is not known to have any major ailment. He has cut down sharply on his public appearances in the past year, but is still believed to play a deciding role in policymaking and apparently is the final voice when party leader <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> and other officials disagree. Some Western experts believe he is the only leader with the full support of the military.

 Police arrested about 80 anti-abortion protesters today at a clinic, the first target of an Easter season offensive undertaken with a blessing from the head of the nation's biggest Roman Catholic archdiocese Some 400 members of Operation Rescue sang `` <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> loves the little children, all little children of the world,'' as the protesters were dragged away from the <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> clinic in Cypress, 20 miles from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The arrests brought cheers from about 150 counter-demonstrators, who had chanted: `` Not the church, not the state, women will decide our fate.'' `` This is too big to ignore. We need to do something for our voices to be heard,'' said <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Otti </PERSON>, one of the pro-choice advocates. The anti-abortion protesters went limp as police in helmets and face shields carried them away. Others crawled up to the clinic on hands and knees to continue the blockades. They, too, were carried off by police. Those arrested were taken on buses to the <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jail, where they were to be issued misdemeanor citations for failing to disperse, said sheriff's Lt. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>. Operation Rescue said it expected up to 2,500 people to protest today at targeted clinics, with most willing to risk jail by ignoring a federal court order against blocking entrances. The New York-based group says 21,000 of its anti-abortion advocates have been arrested in nationwide protests since 1987. Archbishop <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahony </PERSON> lent his prayers to the demonstrators in a statement issued Wednesday. `` I understand and respect the goals of Operation Rescue, appreciate the manifestation by its participants of the value of human life and the need to take active steps to safeguard each human life from the moment of conception,'' he said. `` I offer my prayers for those who choose to participate.'' Pro-choice advocates, describing the demonstrators as bullies, vowed the clinics would remain open throughout protests. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> officials, promising to enforce laws to keep the clinics open, set up a command center four floors under City Hall, just as they do to mobilize forces during earthquakes. Organizers of the protests Wednesday displayed what they said was a human fetus in a small, white coffin at a news conference. `` This is ` Baby Choice,''' said <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>, founder of Operation Rescue. `` She was killed at 19 weeks by a saline solution abortion, and she will answer all your questions.'' <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> left quickly, refusing to answer further questions. The archbishop `` has no comment on the tactics involved,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>, a spokesman for the archdiocese, when asked about the coffin display. One local anti-abortion group, the Right to <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, declined to take part in the protests because of the court order won March 13 by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>. `` My heart is with these people, but I choose to operate within the law,'' said president <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carpenter-McMillan </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Army Reports More than 600 Casualties In Tibet Clashes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A top army officer in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> said Thursday more than 600 casualties have resulted from 21 riots in <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> in the past 18 months, the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. Both the casualty figure and the number of clashes exceeded levels previously acknowledged by authorities who for months sought to minimize the degree of violence in the remote region. Since the latest clash March 5, however, the government has stressed the violence of anti-Chinese protesters in its efforts to portray the clashes as the result of outside plotting. `` These riots, all organized, have been escalating in scale with a rising toll of life and property,'' <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> quoted Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaosong </PERSON>, political commissar of the <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> military region, as saying. It said <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> as a delegate to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s legislature, which is holding its annual meeting.

 A man with an automatic weapon today killed a mother and daughter after taking the younger woman hostage, then sexually assaulted a third woman and fled a traffic accident on foot, authorities said. About 100 law enforcement officers hunted for the man in a suburban <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> area of housing tracts cut by creeks and grassy floodplains. Helicopters helped look for the killer. The man was last seen wearing a cowboy hat, blue jeans and cowboy boots, and was believed armed with either an Uzi or a MAC-10 submachine gun, said Sheriff <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Zotos </PERSON>. `` He's extremely dangerous,'' said Sheriff's Lt. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>. `` We have four or five crime scenes and a lot of people hurt and injured.'' Authorities withheld the names of the shooting victims. <ORGANIZATION> Zotos </ORGANIZATION> said the episode began southwest of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> when a woman phoned an emergency number about 3 a.m. to report a burglary but hung up before sheriff's deputies could ask her questions. Authorities traced the call and discovered the woman and her car missing from her home. Shortly after 6 a.m., the <ORGANIZATION> Louviers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> got a report of shootings in a subdivision. <ORGANIZATION> Zotos </ORGANIZATION> said the gunman had taken his hostage to her mother's home in the subdivision and shot both women. The sheriff said one of two men in the home at the time initially was thought to be wounded but was only covered with blood and not harmed. About 8 a.m., the gunman went to a home in another subdivision, sexually assaulted a woman there and also terrorized a man and child, holding them at gunpoint, authorities said. After the man fled, police learned about the traffic accident involving a vehicle matching the car the gunman was thought to be driving. Based on the damage to the car, authorities believed the man was injured in the accident.

<HEAD>Budget Negotiators Hopeful of Accord When Talks Resume in April</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Budget talks between the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will continue into April as negotiators remain hopeful of accord despite the slow pace of the talks, according to a statement released Thursday. The secret sessions involving President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s aides and the leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> budget committees broke off Wednesday until <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> returns next month from its Easter recess. The bargaining group released a letter Thursday, reporting to the president and the congressional leadership that they believed their talks may eventually bear fruit, a deficit-reduction plan for the fiscal 1990 budget. The letter said the meetings have been `` cordial and constructive'' and added: `` A number of budget options have been discussed. We intend to continue to negotiate on the basis of these and other options in an effort to reach a compromise.'' The goal of the group is to agree on a plan for the $ 1.16 trillion budget that would meet the guidelines of the Gramm-Rudman law, which calls for reducing the federal deficit to $ 100 billion in fiscal 1990. The current year's deficit is expected to exceed $ 160 billion. Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, one of the White House negotiators, predicted Thursday a bipartisan agreement could be negotiated which would not violate <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s no-tax pledge. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed in his budget raising government revenues by about $ 14 billion through a combination of tax increases, user fees, and sales of government assets. However, the administration contends none are `` new taxes.'' In an appearance before the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> also defended the economic assumptions underlying the administration's budget. The forecast has been attacked for using overly optimistic assumptions about economic growth and interest rates. He said that a credible budget deficit reduction plan would lower interest rates and the administration's growth forecast for 1989 and 1990 of 3.2 percent, as measured by the gross national product, reflected the average growth rate of the economy over the past several years. Rep. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said recent government reports indicating a possible return of inflation `` haunt the negotiations'' and has helped spur the negotiators toward creation of a substantive proposal. `` While it began with everybody thinking they really could slide by'' with a minimal plan this year, the economic news has created `` a face-to-face confrontation with reality.'' <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON> said Democrats were not going to propose raising taxes any more than <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. But he said one of his goals in the talks was to make sure the $ 14 billion in revenue would actually be raised, and that it was not a figure based on unrealistic expectations. A third of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s total is his estimate for revenue raised by lowering the tax rate on capital gains, a proposal given little chance on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. The talks are expected to resume April 3. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has an April 15 deadline for completing its annual budget resolution, and it is unlikely a pact could be reached before then. Congressional leaders have indicated the deadline could slip somewhat.

 Young men who boarded a jumbo jet at <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> and got into the cockpit said the caper proved the security has not improved since a bomb brought down <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> said it considered the breach to be extremely serious, but stressed that the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 was in a maintenance area and was not operational. A videotape taken by three young men who said they boarded the aircraft early Monday was shown Thursday by <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. `` They say they are cracking down on security and they are confident no-one else can do what happened at <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Shoaib </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, the only one of the three who was identified. `` It is just not true. `` We want to prove the point and just want to tell the whole world that they are not doing anything about it,'' he said. `` We did break the law and we are ready to stand up and say it was us who did it and this is the reason why we did it.'' Airport security has been a sensitive issue since the bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103, which was blown apart Dec. 21 over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, killing 270 people. The <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> jet boarded by the young men reportedly was at the airline's maintenance base adjoining <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it was `` most concerned'' and had asked <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> for a report. `` It seems that the incident took place in the BA maintenance area, which is <ORGANIZATION> BA </ORGANIZATION>'s private property and outside the restricted area of the airport on Monday morning,'' the department said. <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> has its own security, but the young men said they were not detected. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON>, the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s transportation spokesman, said the incident was a `` clear breach of security'' and said in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> he wanted an explanation from Transport Minister <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Channon </PERSON>. `` He assured us in this House less than 70 hours ago that security at <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> is OK,'' said <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON>. `` It is not, and the traveling public are absolutely concerned about it.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Adley </PERSON>, a lawmaker from the governing <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, called for prosecution of the three. `` People who trespass, for whatever reason, are behaving as irresponsibly as people who make hoax telephone calls, and should be treated as such,'' <PERSON> Adley </PERSON> said.

 Rubella has almost vanished in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since a vaccine was licensed 20 years ago, but federal health officials said Thursday they are concerned that a large number of the remaining cases are occurring among adults. Preliminary figures released Thursday by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> showed there were 221 cases of rubella, also known as German measles, reported in 1988. A final count for 1987 indicated there were 306 cases of rubella, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. The 1988 figure amounted to about one case per 1 million people and represented the lowest total since 1966, when the government began compiling statistics on the disease. It was a 99 percent drop from 1969, when the vaccine was licensed. The disease is fairly mild in most people, but it can cause serious birth defects such as heart disease and mental retardation in babies whose mothers are infected while pregnant. Because of this, health officials are most worried about the risk of infection to women of childbearing age. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said its preliminary figures indicate there was just one case reported last year of a baby born with signs of rubella infection or related birth defects, down from three in 1987. But so far this year, there have been three more cases reported of babies with rubella or related problems. In 1980, the federal <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> set a goal cutting the number of overall cases to 1,000 by 1990, and the number of cases among newborns to fewer than 10. Although both goals were reached years ahead of time, `` unacceptable morbidity is still occurring,'' the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said in its weekly report. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said people 15 and over accounted for 58.2 percent of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rubella cases in 1985-87. Nationwide statistics from before the rubella vaccine was licensed are not broken down by age group, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said, but data from areas that did count rubella cases by age group during that time indicated that only about 23 percent of all cases were in people 15 and over in 1966-68. `` The continued occurrence of rubella in childbearing-aged populations suggests that potentially preventable cases of congenital rubella syndrome may continue to occur during the next 10 to 30 years,'' the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said in its weekly report. Dr. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stehr-Green </PERSON>, an epidemiologist with the Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>, said that during the last major rubella epidemic, in 1962-64, there were 12.5 million cases reported in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, including 20,000 babies born with the disease and 11,000 fetal deaths. <PERSON> Stehr-Green </PERSON> said most of the rubella cases occurring now stem from people failing to get vaccinated, though there are some cases of the vaccine failing to work. `` This is more an issue of failure to vaccinate rather than a failure of the vaccine,'' he said. The government recommends that children get rubella vaccine when they are 15 months old. <PERSON> Stehr-Green </PERSON> said adults who have not had the disease and are not sure if they've been vaccinated are advised to get the shot again.

 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s Roman Catholic bishop has banned bingo in his diocese because he considers the game an unseemly way of raising money. `` This is an evil in the country,'' Bishop <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Unterkoefler </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` People think they are getting something for nothing ... and we are aiding and abetting something that is not good for society. `` I'm not saying gambling is sinful, but I am saying that under state and church auspices, it is no way to raise money,'' he said. Instead, money should be raised by `` sacrificial giving'' by churchgoers, the bishop said. The diocese, which covers the entire state, has 100,000 parishioners in about 100 parishes and missions. The directive issued last week is one of the first such measures in the country, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Conick </PERSON>, a permanent deacon. The diocese could not say how many institutions would be affected and how much revenue they would lose, but <ORGANIZATION> Cardinal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> raises $ 70,000 through bingo games it must end by July 1990. Bingo is legal in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> if it is for the benefit of charitable, religious or fraternal organizations. But state records show that big-time promoters have found ways to get around the law and keep most of the proceeds.

<HEAD>House Passes Minimum Wage Bill After Rejecting Bush Proposal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed legislation today to raise the hourly minimum wage to $ 4.55 after rejecting President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s more modest offer of an increase to $ 4.25, sending the partisan battle to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for another round next month. The vote was 248-171. `` It is n't enough but it certainly is better than nothing,'' House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said of the legislation during a floor speech in favor of the Democrats' bill. Passage came after a 240-179 vote to amend the legislation to set the final level of the minimum wage at $ 4.55 an hour and add a provision allowing employers to pay new entrants in the job market a sub-minimum wage for two months. Earlier, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal, offered by <ORGANIZATION> Republicans </ORGANIZATION> as a substitute to the Democrats' bill, was defeated 218-198, with more than 40 Democrats joining the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> effort. `` I see no defensible argument to say that is adequate,'' Rep. <PERSON> Augustus </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, D-Calif., said of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s offer of a 1992 hourly minimum wage of $ 4.25 <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> was the sponsor of the Democratic bill, which originally called for the minimum wage to rise to $ 4.65 an hour by 1992. But he supported the amendment rolling back the final target by a dime while at the same time moving the effective dates of the increases forward, each by three months. Under the amendment, the first increase, from the current $ 3.35 an hour to $ 3.85, would take effect Oct. 1. <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> and other Democratic sponsors of the measure are staunch opponents of the so-called training wage contained in the amendment that allows some new hires to be paid 85 percent of the minimum wage for 60 days. However, they reluctantly agreed to add it to the bill to win the support of enough moderate-to-conservative Democrats, particularly from Southern states, to keep them from defecting to the Republican effort to substitute <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>' bill. Forty-three Democrats defected nonetheless, while 16 Republicans voted against the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> offer. `` We need an increase in the minimum wage, but we do not need the job loss and the inflation that sometime accompany excessive increased in the minimum wage,'' Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, D-Tenn., said in joining the Republicans The Democratic-backed amendment was expected to pass before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted later today on the legislation itself, the final order of business before a week-long Easter recess. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, already in recess, is to take up a similar minimum-wage bill in early April. The House considered the amendments today after spending several hours Wednesday engaged in a largely partisan debate, with supporters arguing that a pay raise was needed for the working poor was long overdue and opponents saying too big of a boost would hurt those it is designed to help. `` We are not arguing against an increase in the minimum wage, our concern is the size of the increase,'' said Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodling </PERSON>, R-Pa. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has insisted his offer is his last and appears to have the votes to sustain a veto Democrats supporting the bill, however, said the changes they would make through the amendment today represent considerable concessions and called on the president to compromise as well. Joining that effort was a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> congressman who helped draft the amendment, Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridge </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. `` Inflexibility will not serve the interest of the minimum wage worker,'' said Ridge. Several Democrats asserted they had compromised too much already and blamed Republicans for blocking attempts to raise the minimum, which has been $ 3.35 an hour since 1981. `` We ought to be ashamed of having this long period of no realization of the need to have an improvement in the minimum wage,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>.

 About 200,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> troops ended joint military exercises Thursday, and a senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commander said the annual maneuvers would help discourage aggression by <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Gen. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Menetrey </PERSON> said `` Team Spirit'' exercises were held `` solely to test and improve the capability of Korean and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military forces to deter war or defeat aggression on the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula.'' Also Thursday, 13 U.S. Marines who were seriously injured in a helicopter crash during the maneuvers left for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for further medical treatment, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military spokesman said. Nineteen Marines were killed in the crash of a Sikorsky CH-53D Sea Stallion helicopter on Monday near <LOCATION> Pohang </LOCATION> on the southeast coast. Four others died in a separate crash March 17. Communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> repeatedly demanded the exercises _ in their 14th year _ be called off and claimed Team Spirit was a front for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> war prepartions. Radical South Korean students have protested the exercises, and opinion polls indicate many ordinary South Koreans have a growing doubts about it. <PERSON> Menetrey </PERSON> said the exercises were necessary because <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> poses a major military threat to the south. He said the exercises were purely defensive and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s annual protests proved their worth. `` The exercise threatens no one, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> or anyone else,'' <PERSON> Menetrey </PERSON> said. `` In fact, as an effective means to ensure our defense readiness, Team Spirit is a major factor for peace.'' The general expressed regret that <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> had rejected an invitation to send observers to Team Spirit to reassure the <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> government they posed no threat to the north. About 43,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops are based in the South under a mutual defense treaty, and they were joined during the exercises by 27,000 from <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mainland. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces have been based in the South since <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> intervened in 1950 to aid the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> government against the North Korean invasion that started the Korean War. The two Koreas are still technically at war. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military spokesman said two C-141 transport planes carrying 13 injured Marines left a military base near <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> to carry the burn victims to <ORGANIZATION> Brooke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Two burn victims remained in good or fair condition at a <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> military hospital and were not evacuated to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the spokesman said. Monday's helicopter accident was still under investigation.

<TEXT>
 As serious and solemn as religious holidays can be, there is plenty of room for humor. Just ask <PERSON> Cal </PERSON> <PERSON> Samra </PERSON> on `` Easter Monday.'' That's the first day of the Holy Humor Season, a monthlong celebration created by <PERSON> Samra </PERSON>'s Fellowship of Merry Christians, a Kalamazoo-based ecumenical group that believes there's a serious lack of humor in faith. Between 100 and 200 churches in 24 states are expected to celebrate Monday in their own funny way. Festivities, built around the resurrection, will include sing-alongs and joke-tellings sessions. The Merry Christians say raising <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> from the dead was the ultimate in practical jokes that God played on Satan. <PERSON> Samra </PERSON>, who says his 3-year-old group has 10,000 members, believes humor and Christianity often are thought of as mutually exclusive. `` There are two traditions in Christianity: there's a lot of joy and humor and there's also a tradition of solemnity. We felt things had gotten out of balance and we thought we should focus on Christian humor, <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> wit, Christian joy,'' <PERSON> Samra </PERSON> said. In his bimonthly publication `` The Joyful Noiseletter,'' <PERSON> Samra </PERSON> relays references of joy from the New Testament as well as religious-oriented anecdotes and jokes from the famous and not-so-famous: `` The good Lord did n't create anything without a purpose, but the fly comes close'' _ <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Twain </PERSON>. `` Question: What do you get if you cross a praying mantis with a termite? Answer: An insect that says grace before he eats your house.'' <PERSON> Samra </PERSON> figures that if he can bring an occasional chuckle _ or even a grin _ to those he touches, he has served his purpose. His theory, which is shared by scholars and scientists, is that humor is healing. <PERSON> Samra </PERSON>, who began collecting rare drawings that depict <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> with a smile, described his theory in a book, `` The Joyful Christ,'' published in 1986 by <ORGANIZATION> Harper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Row. <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> True </PERSON>, an adjunct professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Notre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dame </ORGANIZATION>, applauds <PERSON> Samra </PERSON>'s work. He believes most members of the clergy would be receptive to it. `` Comedy is meant to get laughs _ usually at someone else's expense But humor is a form of love. It's purpose is to lift the load,'' said True, a psychologist who claims to have the nation's only humor database <PERSON> Samra </PERSON> said about half the fellowship's subscribers are members of the clergy with nearly every denomination represented. Other members are health professionals and humorists. Even clowns. But not everyone agrees that religion should be presented in a lighthearted manner. `` There is a tiny minority out there who have difficulty with the concept of the joyful Christ,'' <PERSON> Samra </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Bankers and consumer-advocacy groups urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday to narrow the insurance industry's exemptions from antitrust laws. `` Consumers suspect they're not getting their money's worth from insurers,'' said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Corwin </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` How could they,'' he said, `` when price collusion at the wholesale level is permitted by the antitrust exemption; competition at the retail level is inhibited by -LRB- state -RRB- anti-rebate laws; and the potential market entrant with the greatest ability to provide new underwriting capacity and more efficient distribution, the banking industry, is barred at the door?'' In testimony to the commerce, consumer protection and competitiveness subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Corwin </PERSON> endorsed in general terms a bill by the subcommittee chairman, Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, to forbid some collective activities that insurance companies may engage in under their antitrust exemptions. Several insurance companies and trade groups argued against <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>'s bill, contending it would lead to a reduction in the number of companies offering property and casualty insurance. Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON>, R-Pa., said he would `` not stand idly by'' if he thought <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would jeopardize the existence of any companies in his home state `` Evidence has not been forthcoming'' to justify a need to change the present system, <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> said `` this legislation will not cure'' problems of high premium costs and limited availability of auto, health and life insurance, but only provide `` one critically needed step.'' There is no federal regulation of insurance, which is left to the states under a 1945 law. <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>'s bill would forbid the sharing of information to determine premiums or coverage areas, bar `` tie-in'' sales such as requirements that motorists buy a homeowner's policy with their auto policy, and ban `` any action to impair the availability or affordability of insurance.'' Companies could still share loss and reserve data. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Berrington </PERSON>, a lawyer for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> representing member casualty and property insurers, said the tie-in prohibition appeared so strict `` it would have prevented the marketing of today's standard homeowner's policy ... -LRB- and -RRB- the marketing of commercial multiperil policies. And it would prevent innovation in the future.'' However, <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lipsen </PERSON>, representing <ORGANIZATION> Consumers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said such purchase requirements currently `` leave virtually no avenues for redress.'' `` If the only butcher in town conditioned the sale of deluxe boneless chicken breasts on the purchase of soup bones, such conduct might be subject to a substantial fine,'' she said.

 A millionaire with a hankering for Russian pumpernickel has struck a deal with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to fly 2,000 loaves a week to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> consumers. `` I thought it was an interesting metaphor _ breaking bread with the <LOCATION> Russians </LOCATION>; I call it peace bread,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Kayden </PERSON>, 58, of <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, who describes himself as a `` retired multimillionaire.'' <PERSON> Kayden </PERSON> grew to love Russian bread during his business travels, and always brought home a few loaves. `` It's like old-fashioned bread, with no preservatives,'' he said. Two months ago, he began talks with <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Saikin </PERSON>, chairman of the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> city council, who arranged the venture with help from <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. The bread will be served at the Waldorf-Astoria and <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> hotels, and sold at 15 <PERSON> Zaro </PERSON>'s Bread Basket stores in the metropolitan area at a price of $ 4 to $ 5 for a 2-pound loaf. `` The Russian bread has a slightly sour taste that you would find in a traditional Jewish rye bread, but with even more flavor and taste,'' said <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaro </PERSON>, president of <PERSON> Zaro </PERSON>'s. `` It has a very good shelf life because it's very dense and moist,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Doherty </PERSON>, executive chef of the Waldorf. The officials sampled four varieties during a <ORGANIZATION> Waldorf </ORGANIZATION> taste-test Wednesday: regular rye, Unzhensky, <PERSON> Darnitzky </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Borodino </LOCATION> _ the latter a dark, slightly sweet bread, lightly laced with caraway seeds, anise and coriander. They ordered 500 loaves of each, and will let the public decide what kind to import in the future.

 Police launched an investigation Thursday after Western journalists photographed plainclothes policemen who had pasted press signs on their car to disguise their identity while investigating Palestinians. The incident drew a formal complaint from the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, which said in a letter to the government that such action places journalists `` at great personal risk'' and urged authorities `` to cease such behavior immediately.'' The army and other security agencies repeatedly have denied rumors their agents pose as reporters to get into Arab areas to watch suspects and make arrests. Journalists covering the 15-month Palestinian uprising have expressed fears that such activity could endanger them if <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> became fearful of vehicles with press tags. Police spokesman <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandori </PERSON> said there were two policemen involved, `` but it was the idea of just one of them, his own personal idea.'' Police Commissioner <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Krauss </PERSON> has called for an officer to be appointed to investigate the matter, <PERSON> Sandori </PERSON> said. The policemen will remain on duty while the inquiry is made. `` The policeman did not break the law, but of course this is a case of ethics,'' <PERSON> Sandori </PERSON> said. Among the journalists who saw the undercover policemen using a car with a press sign was a crew from the London-based Visnews television agency. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sposito </PERSON>, the Visnews bureau chief in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, said a team first noticed the car parked near one of the gates to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> `` It was a late-model <ORGANIZATION> Subaru </ORGANIZATION>, a rental car, with handwritten press signs in the front and rear windows,'' <PERSON> Sposito </PERSON> said. `` Press was written in English.'' The crew became suspicious when it did not recognize the men in the car and photographed them. About three hours later, <PERSON> Sposito </PERSON> said, Visnews photographed the same two men arresting <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> women after a stone-throwing incident in the Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> neighborhood of <LOCATION> Wadi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joz </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sposito </PERSON> said. `` Both were armed with sidearms and had handcuffs,'' he said. `` One was talking on a police radio, and one was dragging a Palestinian girl away after arresting her.'' <PERSON> Eli </PERSON> <PERSON> Hershkowitz </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Zoom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Photo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said he had seen the rented Subaru twice with press tags. `` Yesterday, I saw it with handwritten signs that said ` Press,''' <PERSON> Hershkowitz </PERSON> said. `` Today I saw it in the morning with signs front and back that said ` Television.''' The statement issued by the press association for foreign journalists quoted the Visnews description of the incident. It said: `` The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> deplores such an impersonation of journalists by the authorities as an act that places us at great personal risk. `` We can not accept such behavior. It conveys to those we are trying to cover that we, the real journalists, may well be police agents.''

<HEAD>Pope Washes Feet of Young Priests in Holy Thursday Ceremony</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> knelt before 12 young priests and washed their feet Thursday evening in a re-enactment of the <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>'s Last Supper with his apostles. Thousands of worshipers packed the vast, marble-columned Basilica of St. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lateran </PERSON>, which is considered the pope's special church as bishop of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, for the solemn Holy Thursday ceremony. Earlier in the day, the pope led 1,200 clergymen in renewing their priestly vows in a Mass in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peter </LOCATION>'s Basilica. The services marked the beginning of four of the most important days in the Roman Catholic calendar, marking the crucifixion of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> and his resurrection on Easter Sunday. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, wearing white robes trimmed with gold, washed the feet of a dozen priests from different countries who are studying in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, in a ritual symbolizing <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>' humility before he was crucified on Good Friday. The pope poured water from a golden urn onto the foot of each of the priests, who were seated on a platform beneath the altar and wore gold robes. The pope then wiped each foot with a white cloth and gently kissed it. Three of the priests were from <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, two were from <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> and two from <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>. The others were from <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. The pope then celebrated Mass and delivered a homily on the subject of Christian unity and reconciliation between people of different countries and classes. `` All of us, who share the bread of the Eucharist, open ourselves toward our brothers in the exercise of an authentic charity that finds its realization in the family, in the professional world, in schools, in the community and in society,'' he said. Catholics mark the Last Supper as the gathering at which Christ instituted the Mass, the sacrament of the priesthood, and the Eucharist _ the transformation of bread and wine into his body and blood. On Friday, the pope will carry a wooden cross in a Good Friday procession near the Colosseum. He will celebrate the Easter vigil on Saturday night followed on Easter Sunday by a Mass in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peter </LOCATION>'s Square During the Mass on Thursday, the <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> blessed the holy oils used at baptisms, confirmations and the consecrations of bishops. Twenty-four cardinals, 50 bishops and 1,200 priests took part in the service before about 10,000 people.

 Ugandan warrior-priestess <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Lakwena </PERSON> did not flee a rioting refugee camp in central <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> earlier this week because she was never there, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official said Thursday. `` She has been in <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, but she was n't in a camp,'' said <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Allison </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> High Commissioner for Refugees official in <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION>. `` After her release from prison, she was placed in what was considered a safe hideout. The government of <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> knew where she was and we knew where she was.'' <PERSON> Allison </PERSON> would not say where that `` hideout'' was, whether Ms. <PERSON> Lakwena </PERSON> still was there, or what she was doing. He said she had not been placed in a group. <PERSON> Allison </PERSON> said that since early 1988 when Ms. <PERSON> Lakwena </PERSON> finished a four-month jail sentence for entering <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> illegally, she has been under <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> auspices while her application for asylum is under consideration. `` The application is still being processed,'' said <PERSON> Allison </PERSON>. `` It has neither been approved nor rejected.'' A local newspaper Tuesday reported Ms. <PERSON> Lakwena </PERSON> was among more than 100 refugees who fled from a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> camp in <LOCATION> Thika </LOCATION>, 27 miles north of <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION>, on Monday after rioting refugees damaged a car, broke doors and beat up a storekeeper. Ms. <PERSON> Lakwena </PERSON>, 28, who called herself a medium of God, fled to <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> in December 1987 after Ugandan government forces defeated her yearlong suicidal crusade to wrest power from President <PERSON> Yoweri </PERSON> <PERSON> Museveni </PERSON>. Her forces were battalions of believers she inspired to go into battle singing hymns, their chests smeared with oil they believed would repel bullets and armed with stones she said would explode like grenades. Thousands of her followers died before <PERSON> Museveni </PERSON>'s army crushed her campaign. <PERSON> Museveni </PERSON>'s government has not asked for Ms. <PERSON> Lakwena </PERSON>'s extradition, according to <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Adala </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> division in <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s Ministry of Foreign Affairs However, <PERSON> Allison </PERSON> said he could not elaborate in detail on Ms. <PERSON> Lakwena </PERSON>'s circumstances because of the `` nature of the case'' and <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION>'s interest in it.

<HEAD>Congress May Cut Proposed $1 Million-a-Day Penalty</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will consider reducing the $ 1 million-a-day fines proposed by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as part of a crackdown on fraud in the savings and loan industry, a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee chairman said Thursday. Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, chairman of the Judiciary subcommittee on criminal justice, said in an interview that he supported stiffer fines, but added, `` We have to discuss how much to raise them.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is proposing an increase from $ 1,000 to $ 25,000 a day for most violations of banking regulations but up to $ 1 million daily if the violation was made with reckless disregard for the safety of the institution. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yingling </PERSON>, executive director of government relations for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, in testimony to <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>'s panel, said such `` extraordinarily harsh penalties'' could prevent banks and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls from attracting qualified managers and directors `` Increasing civil money penalties to such a substantial amount sets a dangerous precedent giving regulators the power to assess penalties that could threaten the stability of an institution,'' he said. <PERSON> Yingling </PERSON> also objected to provisions of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposal permitting regulators to decide when a violation was committed with reckless disregard, triggering the $ 1 million penalty. He said fines should be capped at $ 2,500 a day. <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, during a break in the hearing, said, `` I think that's too low, but I think you could find a happy medium. After the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> acts on legislation next month, other panels, including <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>'s, likely will amend sections coming within their jurisdiction. Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, a congressional investigative agency, told the subcommittee earlier that most of the money lost by failed thrifts is attributable to fraud rather than adverse economic conditions or deregulation. They said the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> examined 26 insolvent savings and loans in eight states and found evidence of fraud or abusive insider dealing in each. As part of a broader bill to bail out the insurance fund backing S & amp; L deposits, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is proposing spending $ 50 million a year on discovering and prosecuting fraud at banks and S & amp; Ls. <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> suggested that more spending might enable the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to prosecute a greater proportion of the 4,000 pending fraud cases involving losses of $ 100,000 or more. But the acting associate attorney general, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitely </PERSON>, declined to ask for an appropriation larger than recommended by the president. Meanwhile, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> attorney representing the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION>, said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> bill represents `` a permanent threat to the rights of the people of this nation'' and a `` blatant attempt to avoid the Constitution in exchange for a quick economic score for the government coffers.'' He specifically criticized provisions that would give financial institution investigators greater access to grand jury testimony, which is normally considered secret, and that would extend the statute of limitations for bank fraud from five years to 10 years. The <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Yingling </PERSON> complained that a proposal to pay rewards of up to $ 100,000 for information leading to bank fraud convictions could `` lead to widespread abuse by disgruntled employees or disappointed customers.'' He predicted that overworked authorities `` would be inundated with tidbits or hunches.''

<HEAD>Japan Welcomes Soviet Agreement on More Talks on Territory Issue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Although the Soviet position remains `` very rigid'' against returning a group of northern islands to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> welcomes <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s willingness to continue talks, a Foreign Ministry official said Thursday. The nations concluded three days of working-level meetings on Tuesday without reaching any agreement on the territorial dispute over the <LOCATION> Kuril </LOCATION> islands that blocks a peace treaty to formally end World War II hostilities. `` It is noteworthy that this session has taken place and both sides agreed to have another round of talks on this issue,'' ministry spokesman <PERSON> Taizo </PERSON> <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON> said at a briefing. `` This is something we welcome. I think we do share the common recognition about the need to continue dialogue of this kind,'' he added. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> long has balked at even talking about the islands off northern <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> that the Soviets seized at the end of World War II. About 10,000 Soviet troops are stationed there. This time, <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON> said, they decided to spell out their views on the issue, `` almost for the first time.'' The Japanese contend there never had been any question about the islands being under Japanese rule until after World War II. Rather than discussing the legal points of the issue, the Soviets insisted they had taken the lead in discovery and exploration of the islands, <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON> said. `` This is a working group discussion rather than a kind of pure negotiations and the purpose of this is ... to deepen understanding of the positions of each party,'' <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON> said. `` We have found out the <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> position is very rigid on this territory issue.'' Asked how the talks had affected a possible visit to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> by Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON> said, `` Having studied the position of the Japanese government, if the Soviet leader decides to come, that is welcome. ... It is up to them whether they would decide to come.'' Japanese Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> will visit <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in May. The working-level talks were headed by Vice Foreign Ministers <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogachev </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Takakazu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuriyama </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. They also took up Soviet-China relations, tensions in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s withdrawal of troops from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials said.

<TEXT>
 A judge has ordered the arrest of deposed dictator <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Gustavo </PERSON>, for receiving millions of dollars in `` illegal enrichment,'' officials said Thursday. The younger <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, an air force colonel, accompanied his father into exile in neighboring <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> on Feb. 5, two days fter Gen. <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> seized power in a coup. Judge <PERSON> Dario </PERSON> <PERSON> Caballero </PERSON> <PERSON> Bracho </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Gustavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s arrest late Wednesday after receiving a police report describing how he `` illictly obtained copious amounts of money.'' The report, published in part Thursday by the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diario </ORGANIZATION>, describes the colonel as a `` fugitive.'' Officials said the court could seek an extradition order after an investigation of the charges. According to the police report, Col. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> received at least $ 725,000 a month from three <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION> bingo houses in 1985-88. `` He used psychological pressure, saying ` If you do n't give me my cut I can close the business or give it to someone else,''' said police spokesman <PERSON> Osvaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Palacios </PERSON>. `` Everyone knew this man had the power to decide.'' Gambling is legal in <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>. Bingo houses and casinos are licensed by the government. The police report also said <PERSON> Gustavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> was a major stockholder in the insurance company <ORGANIZATION> Mundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.A. </ORGANIZATION>, which won several contracts from builders of two hydroelectric projects: <ORGANIZATION> Itaipu </ORGANIZATION> on the Brazilian border and <ORGANIZATION> Yacyreta </ORGANIZATION> on the border with <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. It said he received $ 21 million in insurance fees from <LOCATION> Itaipu </LOCATION> alone. `` Part of this money was ill-gotten while another portion was a legitimate result of the business,'' <PERSON> Palacios </PERSON> said. Col. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> `` used his influence to obtain contracts for third parties ... in exchange for cash award,'' the report said. Interior Minister <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Machuca </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> said four officials of <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s government had been sent to the interior of the country `` for security reasons'' during the investigation of charges against them. He identified them as Pastor <PERSON> Coronel </PERSON>, former chief of police investigations; <PERSON> Delfin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ugarte </PERSON> <PERSON> Centurion </PERSON>, who was industry and commerce minister; Gen. <PERSON> Gaspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, former defense minister, and <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Velazquez </PERSON> <PERSON> Excobar </PERSON>, a former legislative leader. Charges against them include corruption and illegal enrichment, <PERSON> Machuca </PERSON> said. Police deported <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Mella </PERSON> <PERSON> Latorre </PERSON>, 39, a Chilean who served six years for participating in the 1980 assassination in <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION> of deposed President <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mella </PERSON> <PERSON> Latorre </PERSON> was put on a Thursday morning flight to <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Government Warning Issued to Newspaper Before First Edition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government is threatening punitive action against an anti-apartheid newspaper even before it publishes its first regular edition, a spokesman for the newspaper said Thursday. The newspaper, The New African, could be required to pay a registration fee of about $ 16,000 to begin publishing as planned on April 3, said spokesman <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> <PERSON> Naidoo </PERSON>. The weekly, intended to serve readers in <ORGANIZATION> Natal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Province </ORGANIZATION>, received a letter last week from the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> saying a registration fee was under consideration. The government does not automatically charge a fee for a new publication, but may do so if it rules that the publication may later be banned for violating security regulations. The letter said Justice Minister <PERSON> Kobie </PERSON> <PERSON> Coetsee </PERSON> had received information that The New African's staff was `` committed to the South African liberation sturggle.'' `` Information at the minister's disposal indicates that The New African will probably operate on similar lines as the New Nation,'' said the letter, referring to a Johannesburg-based weekly newspaper shut down by the government for three months last year for allegedly publishing subversive material. <PERSON> Naidoo </PERSON> said The New African's lawyers would talk to the government in hopes of avoiding or minimizing any fee, and expected to get a final ruling next week. In a response to <PERSON> Coetsee </PERSON>, The New African protested `` the way in which a small publication like our own is placed in jeopardy in advance of publication.'' The Association of Democratic Journalists, which often criticizes government censorship, said the threat against The New African shows the government `` has so little legitimacy that it can not afford to allow even a single new critical voice to be raised against it.''

 A judge sentenced a man to 22 years in prison Thursday for conspiring to smuggle more than $ 172 million in cocaine into <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Two Americans, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Den </PERSON> <PERSON> Breen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cermac </PERSON>, also were jailed for 12 and seven years respectively for their part in importing 880 pounds of the drug in 1986 _ the largest amount ever smuggled into <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. In passing sentence on businessman <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> and the Americans, Judge <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Machin </PERSON> said substantial sentences were needed to `` make it clear beyond peradventure that drug-trafficking will be stamped out by the courts.'' He said the drugs trade `` causes untold misery, damage and sometimes death to the takers of drugs.'' Addressing <PERSON> Garner </PERSON>, the judge said, `` I am quite satisfied that but for your involvement in this conspiracy, a huge quantity of cocaine would never have come to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>.'' A jury found the three guilty Wednesday following a trial at the <ORGANIZATION> Old </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bailey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>.

A 43-year-old woman, who could not be identified under court rules, also was found guilty of conspiracy to supply cocaine. She will be sentenced at a later date. The drugs were shipped from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> to the Cornish coast off <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> in 1986, then taken to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> for distribution. But when customs officials confiscated the cocaine about a year later, only 120 pounds was left.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Nearly 4.7 million acres of land were damaged by wind in the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> last winter, one of the most extensive losses on record, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. `` Much of this damage is due to the drought,'' said <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> Scaling, chief of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Soil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` We went into the wind erosion season with poor cover in much of the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> because of the drought. Then this winter, we've had a combination of no snow cover and high-velocity winds in many areas.'' Scaling said 88 percent of the acreage damaged was cropland, with rangeland accounting for most of the remainder. The <ORGANIZATION> SCS </ORGANIZATION> surveys <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> damage annually from Nov. 1 through the following May 31, a seven-month period when winds are highest and soils are driest. The damage to 4.7 million acres was through February. Scaling said the northern plains were hard hit, with <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> showing damage to nearly 1.4 million acres, about 30 percent of the 10-state total. Losses in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> have been greater than at any time since <ORGANIZATION> SCS </ORGANIZATION> began the regular surveys in 1955. Agency records go back to the mid-1930s, but figures for some of those years were obtained from other sources. The worst damage was done to about 16 million acres in 1954-55, although the old Dust Bowl probably exceeded that in the early 1930s before annual figures were compiled. But the 1987-88 season was bad, too, with more than 13 million acres damaged in the region. Another was in 1980-81 when the agency reported 12.5 million acres. Land is considered wind-damaged when the effects of wind are apparent to the eye. By that time, according to conservationists, the erosion rate has reached about 15 tons per acre a year, usually at least three times faster than is `` tolerable,'' or naturally replaceable. A loss of five tons per acre translates into a layer of soil about the thickness of a dime spread over one acre. Scaling said farmers used emergency tillage on more than a million acres to help reduce the blowing by roughing the surface exposed to wind. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> accounted for 80 percent of the emergency tillage, about 880,000 acres. In addition to the land damaged during the four-month period, Scaling said more than 22.5 million acres were `` in condition to blow'' as of March 1, the most in 32 years. Highest on the list are <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, he said. According to the survey, which was made in 541 counties of the region's 10 states, here is the state-by-state breakdown comparing damaged acres in November, December, January and February with the same four months of 1987-88:

The <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> overturned <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' conviction for killing Patrolman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, saying prosecutors withheld evidence and used perjured testimony. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> originally was sentenced to death and at one point was three days from being executed, but his sentence was commuted to life in prison in 1980. Despite his experience, the 40-year-old <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said the state's judicial system `` in my case worked <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> did not execute me.'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> has called <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> `` hell on earth'' but said he holds no grudge against Texans. `` I do not blame the people of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> or the people of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> for the actions of a few,'' he said. He also reiterated that he would welcome the chance to come back and clear his name in a retrial. `` Of course I would love to have a jury release me in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` I did not kill <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>.'' `` I believe that if the retrial happens, we may be able to receive some answers as to why all of this happened, and I would like that,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. His case gained international attention after the release of `` The Thin Blue Line.'' The documentary questioned the testimony of then-16-year-old <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Vidor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, who had picked up <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> the day of the shooting after <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' car ran out of gas. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> was killed after stopping a car for a traffic violation. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> has said <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> dropped him off before the shooting occurred. During the trial, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> was the state's key witness, saying he saw <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> kill <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>. But the film showed <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> recanting his accusations, as well as other witnesses reporting information that conflicted with their testimony. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> all but confessed to the shooting, and is on death row for another slaying. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said he has received a few job offers but has no specific plans. He said he has n't quite grasped the fact that he is finally free. `` I just want to go home. I will see where I stand at that point,'' he said.

 Police began arming themselves Thursday with semi-automatic rifles to guard against firebomb attacks by protesters demanding the ouster of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo. The announcement of the measures prompted riots by thousands of students in six cities. Police also put about 5,000 investigators of the 130,000-member force on alert and ordered them to arrest leftists, the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Chosun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ilbo </ORGANIZATION> reported. Senior government officials, who refused to be further identified, said police were being issued about 13,000 M-16 rifles after the government approved better weapons for police to help defend police posts and government facilities against mounting firebomb attacks. Government buildings and police stations have been the targets of frequent firebomb attacks by radical students. Police said scores of policemen have been injured this year by firebombs. The government action prompted a strong opposition backlash. Dissidents and opposition parties charged it could aggravate unrest, urged <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> to rescind the decision and planned a parliamentary hearing on the issue. The opposition <ORGANIZATION> Reunification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> denounced <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s decision as `` tantamount to declaring a war against the people. About 5,000 students staged violent protests around campuses in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and five other cities, according to the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> news agency <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, riot police stopped about 800 students who tried to march out of <ORGANIZATION> Sejong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> with firebombs and rocks to demand <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>' ouster. In <LOCATION> Suwon </LOCATION>, 24 miles south of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, about 700 students armed with hundreds of firebombs battled riot police for three hours, denouncing <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s order. At least five students and three police were injured. <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> also reported clashes in the southern cities of <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chonju </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taejon </LOCATION> and the eastern city of <LOCATION> Chunchon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> ordered security forces Wednesday to launch a crackdown on radicals and dissidents, warning they were a threat to stability. `` All government offices must cooperate to root out the violent and destructive acts of leftists attempting to overthrow the government,'' a presidential spokesman quoted <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> as saying. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s order was seen as a warning to radicals, who have little support but have organized numerous protests. Prosecutor-General <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gi-chun </PERSON> followed up on <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s directive by issuing orders Thursday for a clampdown on pro-North Korean activities. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> told a meeting of senior government prosecutors the nation's safety was at stake because of threats by leftist groups trying to overthrow the government He ordered the seizure of all pro-North Korean publications and the arrest of people using firebombs to attack government facilities. On Monday, <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> postponed a promised referendum on his performance, citing threats from radicals and disagreement on how to hold the vote. Government hard-liners have urged <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> to end violent protests and matain stability. Many South Koreans are critical of the government for failing to sever ties with <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s authoritarian predecessor, <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>, who went into rural exile in November after making a public apology for misdeeds under his reign.

But, the officials said, he initially was offered only the role of ambassador-emeritus, meaning he would be on occasional call, and turned it down. `` There was no major spat,'' an official told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` It was all handled in a gentlemanly way.'' But still, the officials said on condition of anonymity, <PERSON> Nitze </PERSON> had freed his staff to take other jobs and was prepared to leave himself until <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> invited him to the White House a few weeks ago to discuss the situation. The session, the officials said, produced the compromise that he would be a part-time consultant to the president and to <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. His resignation as a full-time adviser, effective May 1, still stands. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, rejected published accounts that linked <PERSON> Nitze </PERSON>'s departure to disagreements with <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> over what <PERSON> Nitze </PERSON>'s job would be in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, saying the reports were `` unfortunate because they are inaccurate.'' `` Having talked to both sides I feel confident in assuring you that there was not that kind of atmosphere involved in this particular case,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Nitze </PERSON>, under former Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, played a key role in the U.S.-Soviet treaty signed in 1987 to abolish intermediate-range nuclear missiles.

 More than 300 women police officers from 39 countries called for better career opportunities Thursday as they ended a conference on issues ranging from child care at the police station to sexual harassment in the patrol car. `` Although more and more women are now pursuing a career in law enforcement, the top slots in police organizations worldwide remain in the hands of men,'' said Maj. <PERSON> Marian </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Labije </PERSON>, one of the Dutch organizers of the four-day meet. `` And that means that it also remains very difficult to draw the attention of the higher echelons to the problems facing female police personnel,'' Ms. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Labije </PERSON> said. She noted only a handful of about 100 male Dutch police commanders and other law enforcement dignitaries invited to the conference's opening Monday showed up. The conference, the first of its kind to be held outside <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, where women police officers founded their organization as early as in 1915, was attended by women police officers from nations ranging from <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>. `` What we ought to do is change the minds of men, their dinosaur mentality,'' said <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, a detective in the Narcotics Division of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> police department and the president of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Officers </ORGANIZATION>, an organization with members in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. `` Men and women must train side by side to convince the men that we're not just the captain's girl,'' Ms. <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> said in an interview in this western Dutch town 20 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>. In the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, 7 percent of the nation's 30,000-member police force is female, a figure that reflects the situation in many parts of the world, said Ms. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Labije </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, 3,000 of the city's 28,000 police officers are women. The Dutch want to increase the women's share to 25 percent by 1995, but Ms. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Labije </PERSON> said it's unlikely that goal will be met. One of the problems facing women in law enforcement is proper child care, said Ms. <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, who brought her two children to the conference. `` In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, they're trying to develop a child care system, but so far, only civil personnel is benefiting from it because it's a 9-to-5 scheme,'' Ms. <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> said. `` It's worthless to people who're working in shifts. The only area where proper child care facilities are less of a roadblock is <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, where such care traditionally has been part of the extended family, said Ms. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Labije </PERSON>, an officer in the <ORGANIZATION> Juvenile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>. One of the conference's workshops dealt with sexual behavior in a mixed police force, but the problem of harassment seems to be on the wane, according to Superintendant <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> of the Police Community Relations Department in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. `` It is easier now for female officers now that there is total integration, now all sections are open to women,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON>. `` The acceptance is good, and we have women in all departments, from motorcycle patrol people to special branch detectives,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON>, who noted that until 1974, women police officers were forced to resign from the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Garda </LOCATION> when they married. At the meeting, participants from <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> founded the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policewomen </ORGANIZATION>, which plans another conference in two years.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Syrian army gunners and allied Druse militiamen fought artillery duels with Christian army units Thursday, and police said 15 people were killed and 42 wounded. Most of the casualties were civilians in Christian east Beiruts, where rockets sometimes landed at the rate of 40 a minute. A police spokesman said the dead included an 80-year-old woman who was crossing the street in east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s Saloumeh residential district. A Lebanese soldier also was wounded, police said. The new casualities brought the toll to 81 killed and 253 wounded since fighting began March 8 between Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who commands the 20,000 Christians in the Lebanese army, and the Druse militia led by <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>. Other Moslem militias and the 22,000 Moslem soldiers led by Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Sami </PERSON> <PERSON> Khatib </PERSON> appear to have stayed out of the dispute. The fighting threatens <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> efforts to mediate a political crisis that split the army on sectarian lines and created competing Christian and Moslem governments. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> heads the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> government in addition to commanding the army's <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> units. More than 5,000 shells and rockets landed overnight in both sectors of the capital, in the Christian region to the north and east, and Druse-held territory to the southeast. Residents of <LOCATION> Aramoun </LOCATION>, seven miles south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> gunners operated rocket launchers overnight from the hill on which the village sits. It was the first independent confirmation of Syrian involvement. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has accused <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> of firing on the 310-square-mile Christian region, where 1 million Christians live in a crescent-shaped enclave with the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> at their backs. One witness in <LOCATION> Aramoun </LOCATION> said Syrian rocket launchers were `` pouring fire all night at the Christian sector.'' <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has 40,000 soldiers in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and has become the country's main power broker during a 14-year civil war <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has declared a `` war of liberation'' against the Syrian forces. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said all foreign troops except for peacekeepers of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> should leave the country. Asked if that included <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said: `` That would be all those non-Lebanese armed elements and organizations currently on <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> soil, with the exception of <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION>.'' The thuds of exploding shells echoed across <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and the surrounding wooded mountains. Residents huddled in basements and bomb shelters. The latest violence began two days after <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> blockaded private ports militias use to finance their operations, which skim the government otherwise would collect at the five legal harbors on <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 130-mile coastline. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s government has been divided since Sept. 22, when <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> could not agree on a successor to President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> and he appointed <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> to lead an interim military cabinet. Moslems rejected the appointment and swore allegiance to <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, the Sunni Moslem premier who served during <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>'s term. Under an unwritten national covenant dating to independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1943, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s president is a Christian, the premier a Sunni and the parliament speaker a Shiite Moslem.

 Egg production is down about 6 percent from a year ago, mostly reflecting a sharp cutback by producers, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. Total production during the first three months of the marketing year that began Dec. 1 was estimated at 16.7 billion eggs, down from 17.7 billion a year earlier, the department said in a report. As of March 1, laying hens totaled 271 million, down from 282 million a year ago.

The department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> says 1989 egg production is expected to be down around 2 percent fromf last year because of the reduction in laying hens.

<HEAD>Human Rights Lawyer Dies One Day After Attack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A human rights lawyer died of his injuries one day after being shot by an unidentified gunman, a human rights organization said Thursday. <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Tonog </PERSON>, 37, was the sixth human rights lawyer slain during the administration of President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. He died Wednesday from bullet wounds to the head and chest suffered in Tuesday's attack in <LOCATION> Catarman </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Samar </LOCATION> province, about 300 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, according to the Free Legal Assistance Group. Word of his death reached <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> on Thursday shortly after the group sent a chartered plane to transfer Tonog to <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> for surgery, said <PERSON> Milabel </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristobal </PERSON>, a member of the group. The group on Wednesday blamed the attack on the military, which has also been accused of involvement in the previous killings of lawyers. The military has denied most of the charges. A member of a government-organized militia was convicted of murder after admitting he was the gunman in the 1988 slaying of human rights lawyer <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Surigao </PERSON> last year, but charges were dropped against a military major whom the gunman identified as the mastermind. The other killings remain unsolved. All the victims were members of the legal assistance group or other human rights organizations. They all acted as defense attorneys for people accused of either being communist rebels or of supporting the insurgents. `` These attacks against human rights lawyers also symbolize a breakdown in the judicial machinery and the death of the rule of law,'' the group said. `` While no lawyer is safe to fight for people's rights in the courts, due process and other guarantees of human rights enshrined in the constitution remain beautiful but empty phrases.'' The group said Wednesday that four gunmen attacked <PERSON> Tonog </PERSON> while he and his wife, <PERSON> Merlita </PERSON>, were at a roadside shed waiting for a ride home during a heavy rain. Mrs. <PERSON> Tonog </PERSON> was not hurt. On Thursday, it said only one gunman was involved and that he shot Tonog from point-blank range in the head, chest and back. The gunman fled aboard a motorcycle driven by an unidentified companion. <PERSON> Tonog </PERSON> had received many death threats recently, the group said. He survived a knife attack in 1981 in his Catarman law office, and the assailant, a policeman, was arrested, tried and convicted. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> ordered investigations into the other killings after human rights and lawyers' groups charged it was only since she took over from deposed President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> three years ago that lawyers were being killed for defending alleged subversives. During <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' 20-year rule, most forms of harassment of alleged subversives' attorneys consisted only of telephone threats, bugged telephone lines and military surveillance, lawyers have said.

 Officials said Thursday that the nation's eight so-called democratic political parties will continue to operate under communist guidance and that new parties will not be allowed.

The parties will operate only under the leadership of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which has ruled <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> since 1949, he said. The plan comes as a growing number of intellectuals are calling for more political freedom and appears to be an attempt by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to silence critics without relinquishing power. Leaders of the eight parties said Thursday they expected more government officials to be appointed from their ranks. `` The Communist Party of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the eight democratic parties share the same goals.

 District of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said Thursday that the nation's capital remains safe for tourists and visiting business people, even in the face of a record murder rate. `` For the most part, the targeted killings and drug activity take place in a small section of the city,'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> told a luncheon audience at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. `` Except for the killings, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has one of the lowest crime rates in the country.'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>'s address, the first delivered by a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> mayor to the press club in 81 years, came in the midst of a drug-related crime wave that has thrust <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>'s government into the international spotlight. In 1988, a record 372 people were killed in the district; police say drugs played a part in 60 percent of those killings. Through Thursday, 119 people have been murdered this year in the nation's capital, roughly twice the number at the same time last year <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> stressed repeatedly that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s drug-related killings are occurring in poorer neighborhoods far from the downtown and the national monuments. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is safe; everyone is safe,'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said. `` I hope to come back here next year and tell you <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is safer than ever before.'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, who is under federal investigation for his ties to a drug suspect, said that the city's crime problems _ not his personal difficulties _ are behind the city's public relations difficulties. `` Drugs are the problem, not <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>,'' the mayor said. `` I urge the media to be fair.'' The mayor said he welcomed assistance from federal officials in curbing the city's drug problem. He said he has had `` productive'' conversations recently with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration drug policy coordinator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, who is considering giving the city extra federal aid and personnel to fight its drug problem.

<TEXT>
 An <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet took off from the wrong runway Thursday, struck several construction barricades and damaged the plane's underside before landing safely in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. American Flight 508, carrying 92 passengers and a crew of six from <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Hobby </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, arrived on time at <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> where passengers deplaned normally, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials said. Airport ground crews found three of 13 wooden barriers destroyed in addition to a 4-by-4-foot plywood sign, said <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>. American spokesman <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> confirmed that the plane hit the sign and a wooden sawhorse, adding that the plane sustained damage to the bottom of the tail section and the wheel base. <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceppi </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which operates Hobby, said barricades mark a runway section closed because of construction. The pilot, whose name was not released, had been provided with recorded information before the takeoff saying the last 2,200 feet of the runway was closed because of construction, <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> said. The pilot was in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> late Thursday afternoon and was `` giving his side of the story'' to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials, <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said. `` We have to ascertain what happened first before we can say what action we will take,'' <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> is continuing its invesigation and no immediate action was taken. The pilot twice had been cleared to take off on a longer runway, but turned down the wrong one, said <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. Shortly after the pilot began taxiing down the runway, controllers noticed he was on the wrong runway and tried to radio him but received no response, <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> said. Once an aircraft is cleared for takeoff, a pilot can switch radio frequencies, and that may have been the case with the American pilot, he said. During the plane's ascent, the tower told the pilot he may have hit a barricade, <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> said. The pilot acknowledged that he thought he hit it. The pilot thought it was safe to continue, Ms. <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said.

 The White House on Thursday played down a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warning about the possible hijacking of an American airliner in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, saying the bulletin was similar to many other terrorist alerts and travelers `` should be confident that all reasonable precautions are being taken.'' Airports in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> stepped up security after receiving the warning issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. No additional precautions were reported in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration was clearly unhappy the warning had leaked out in a front-page newspaper story in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> called it a potentially serious compromise of intelligence-gathering activities and ordered an <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> investigation of the disclosure. Three Lebanese Palestinians were mentioned by name in the warning, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>. The bulletin said the three may be traveling on passports from <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> confirmed that it had issued a security bulletin to airports and carriers March 16 about `` the possibility of a hijacking of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airliner in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' The warning did not mention any specific airline or airport that might be threatened, nor did it cite any time frame for the warning, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said. Disputing the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> accoun, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials emphatically denied that the notice had been relayed to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats and military personnel abroad while being withheld from the public at large _ as was the case with a warning prior to the bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103, which killed 270 people on Dec. 21. White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said last week's warning was intended to heighten `` the already high security procedures now in effect'' and was not designed for public distribution He said the alert was directed to authorities `` who can direct responses to the threat. `` Travelers on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air carriers should be confident that all reasonable precautions are being taken to insure that the highest level of security exists,'' he said. On <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Oberstar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Minn </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aviation subcommittee, said the warning had been distributed only among intelligence and law enforcement agents so that they could pursue further information `` I'm persuaded there was not a double standard,'' he said, referring to accusations the government in the past has warned its employees about terrorist threats but not alerted the public. `` As for the question -LRB- of -RRB- is it safe for <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people traveling, yes,'' <PERSON> Oberstar </PERSON> said, citing beefed up security resulting from the warning. He spoke with reporters after members of his panel received a previously scheduled, private three-hour briefing on aviation security from government and industry officials. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> would not reveal what had prompted the alert, other than to say there had been `` sensitive information'' not designed for public distribution. `` The release of this information by unauthorized persons can be counterproductive to the civil aviation community's efforts to provide a totally effective security system,'' the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said, `` Hopefully, no one will lose their life over this, but it is a very serious matter.'' Army Maj. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinkham </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, which is in charge of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, said the command was aware of the warning but did not pass it along to military personnel. Discussing the warning at a White House briefing, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` My understanding is it is similar to many, many similar kinds of information and security bulletins that go out and would be, in fact, lower than many because it was not given to any military or diplomatic personnel, but rather just to security experts ... at aviation airports and airlines.'' Refusing to divulge the contents of the bulletin, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` I ca n't comment -LRB- on -RRB- what's in this bulletin. I do n't want to unnecessarily scare people or to present public information that might be harmful in many ways. That's the reason it's not made public in the first place.'' He said intelligence agencies routinely collect information about the travel of terrorists or people who are on a suspect list. `` Some of this information, like all intelligence information, is questionable. Some of it has higher value than others. ... `` Unless it has a certain degree of authenticity or believability or credibility or whatever,'' he said, `` you ca n't go out and make general warnings to the public. So that's the situation we're in.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> printed some of the memorandum, which read in part: `` Possible: 3 Lebanese Palestinians may try to hijack a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airliner in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Possible names: <PERSON> Jamel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahmud </PERSON> <PERSON> Talid </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhammed </PERSON>: <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Abuzayni </PERSON>: <PERSON> Khalour </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jafar </PERSON>. `` Alias passports: <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION>, possible genuine @ forged or altered. `` Above information credible although not confirmed.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> backed a Palestinian `` entity'' Thursday as a key to peace in the occupied lands, where hospital officials said soldiers killed a 14-year-old boy and wounded 18 other people. He said he would urge Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, leader of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, to accept the peace plan before the premier visits the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> next month. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> is finance minister in the `` national unity'' coalition of <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> and his center-left party. Newspaper reports said the plan calls for a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state in all but name, demilitarized and in confederation with <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> denied recommending a separate state in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured in the 1967 war. Arab hospital officials said soldiers in the occupied territories shot the boy and wounded 18 other Palestinians. At least 405 Palestinians have been killed since an uprising began in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> more than 15 months ago, and 18 Israelis also have been slain. The army denied any troopers were in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village at the time, but said it was investigating a report that civilian Israelis in the area responded with gunfire when their car was stoned. A spokesman said he had reports of six gunshot wounds. Also Wednesday, Labor and its rival, the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc led by <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, agreed to allocate $ 19.4 million to fund Jewish settlements in the occupied territories. Media reports said Likud demanded almost twice that sum, but <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>' <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> refused. <ORGANIZATION> Haaretz </ORGANIZATION>, a Hebrew-language daily, said the <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> peace plan calls for a one-year truce in the occupied lands, including a moratorium on the uprising. `` In essence, we are talking about abandoning our control of the territories, of <LOCATION> Judea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Samaria </LOCATION>. It's clear it would be handed over to some form of Arab sovereignty,'' said <PERSON> Ephraim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sneh </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> member who worked on the plan, using the biblical names for the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sneh </PERSON> said details have yet to be worked out but the plan has two stages, with the problems of sovereignty and the link to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> to be addressed in the second stage. On television Thursday, <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said `` we are ready for territorial compromise'' but vigorously denied calling for a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state, a risky political concept in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and gave no details. `` I have not proposed a Palestinian state,'' he said. `` I have ruled out the Palestinian state. I will present my plan to Mr. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>.'' He used the phrases `` Palestinian entity'' and `` confederation, according to the example of Benelux'' in describing his plan. The <ORGANIZATION> Haaretz </ORGANIZATION> report said <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> calls the plan `` the <LOCATION> Benelux </LOCATION> model,'' a reference to the close cooperation between <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>. It said the <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> plan would create a three-state federation involving <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> `` entity'' that would be a nation in all ways except that it would have no army. Israeli troops would withdraw, but maintain a presence along the strategic <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> valley. After an informal truce began, direct talks between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> delegation elected from the occupied territories would open in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> under international auspices. Representatives of the `` Palestinian diaspora,'' presumably the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, would be brought in at a later stage, <ORGANIZATION> Haaretz </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said on television Thursday: `` The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has changed. You ca n't deny it.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> still regards the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> as a terrorist organization and refuses to deal with it, but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> began contacts in December, after <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> publicly renounced terrorism and recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist. The second formal meeting was held Wednesday. <PERSON> Avraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Burg </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> dove, said the plan published in <LOCATION> Haaretz </LOCATION> was a rough version of a proposal that has been developed further. `` It's in the right general direction,'' he said of the newspaper report. Soldiers shot six Palestinians Thursday in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and wounded 12 in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, hospital officials said. At <LOCATION> Ousarin </LOCATION> village, near <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, 14-year-old <PERSON> Maher </PERSON> <PERSON> Shakid </PERSON> <PERSON> Said </PERSON> was shot in the chest and killed, according to officials of <LOCATION> Ittihad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. A military court sentenced four Palestinian guerrillas to life imprisonment Thursday for trying to enter <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> last year. The Palestinians confessed to the attempt and said they belonged to the Popular Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION>, a radical Syrian-based faction of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Democrats Gird for Gingrich Battle, Release Letter about his `Questionable
Activities'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 House Democrats, girding for expected partisan warfare following Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>'s selection as <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> minority whip, circulated a letter Thursday raising `` unanswered questions'' about <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>'s activities. `` Where I come from, you do n't look for a fight. But you do n't run from one either,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ark </LOCATION> `` If you do n't fight back, you lose.'' <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> needed an organized campaign to combat <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, who rose to prominence within House GOP ranks largely on the basis of his ethics campaign against Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and two dozen other prominent Democrats. Rep. <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ark </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, sent all <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrats a letter Thursday listing a `` summary of some of the unanswered questions'' about <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>'s activities `` <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>'s penchant for slinging mud is surprising, since his own career is checkered with a string of questionable activities,'' <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> said in the letter. `` In light of these developments, I though it would be useful to familiarize yourself with some examples of the <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> style.'' The letter summarized questions raised previously by the <ORGANIZATION> DCCC </ORGANIZATION> about an unusual promotional deal for <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>'s book, `` Window of Opportunity,'' about $ 13,000 <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> received in 1977 to write a novel that never was published, and about a political action committee chaired by <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> which raised $ 217,868 in direct-mail solicitations for conservative candidates but spent only $ 900 on political campaigns. Reporters' repeated telephone calls to <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>'s office seeking comment on the letter were not immediately returned. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> has said previously that he has committed no improprieties. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> has been `` a bomb thrower for 10 years'' in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the fact that he is now being rewarded by his <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> colleagues means that Democrats can use him as ammunition against all of them. `` That's a gold mine of campaign issues,'' he said. If <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> intends to be a successful whip, however, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> said, he might have to change his tactics. `` He's been the kind of guy who wants to burn the building down, and he does n't care if some of his own members get burned in the fire,'' <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> said. But in the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> leadership, there is `` the potential to defang him.'' Rep. <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorgan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.D. </LOCATION>, compared <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> to a famous figure of plains, Gen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> <PERSON> Custer </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Custer </PERSON> was a hard charger and everybody got excited about him too,'' he said. `` That did n't work out so well.''

<HEAD>FDA: Yellow Light on AIDS Home Tests</HEAD>

 <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> remains cautious about the safety, accuracy and privacy of home AIDS-test kits as currently proposed, <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> told a congressional panel Thursday. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> told members of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on regulation, business opportunities and energy that `` caution at this time is prudent'' because of concerns about technical feasibility as well as privacy and counseling. `` In this disease ... there is a death sentence given with a positive test and without the appropriate interpretation and counseling, the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> is apprehensive that some individuals might not only have major psychological concerns but might do themselves harm,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. More than a dozen companies indicated interest to the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> last year in developing home AIDS-testing kits, all requiring users to collect blood samples at home and send them to laboratories for testing. The results would be supplied by mail or telephone. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> has not approved any such home-testing kits for AIDS, and has restricted market research on such tests to hospitals, clinics, doctors' offices and other traditional health-care settings. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> still has concerns about whether test suppliers can assure that blood samples can be collected properly and remain unchanged by temperature extremes in transit to laboratories. Also, he said, he questions whether tests used will be as accurate as those available used by health-care practitioners and whether results will remain confidential. The agency will hold a public hearing April 6 to further explore the issue, he said. Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON>, D-Ore., subcommittee chairman, said he also has concerns about home AIDS-testing He said he is `` convinced that in the hands of the untrained, the unscrupulous and the insensitive, home AIDS testing can inflict considerable human damage.'' AIDS advocates share the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s concerns, especially about the need for adequate counseling of people who test positive for the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome. `` We are deeply concerned that making a home-test available with a relatively high false positive rate might well be irresponsible in playing with the emotions of already frightened and concerned individuals,'' <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Levi </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Lesbian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, told the panel. He added that testing is only part of the key to controlling AIDS. Counseling about risk in spreading the disease is also integral, he said. `` Testing does not occur in a vacuum. It is most effective when accompanied by quality counseling _ counseling that is best provided and assured in person,'' he said. However, <PERSON> Elliot </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Millenson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Rockville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, who founded a company that developed an AIDS home-test, said potential benefits of such a test far outweigh the potential risks. He said experience has shown that people can safely obtain a small amount of blood for testing and the sample can be safely packaged and withstand unusual and adverse shipping conditions. He also maintained that telephone counseling is as effective as in-person counseling, and that in fact doctors already provide AIDS test results and results of tests for other fatal diseases such as cancer over the phone.

 The power struggle between President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> and the new leader of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, has been resolved, and <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> will retire after an election later this year, news reports said Thursday. `` The fight is over,'' an unidentified government source told The Star, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s largest-selling daily. A compromise was reached in a meeting Tuesday calling for <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> to step down after a general election in the second half of 1989, the newspaper and government-run television reported. Neither de Klerk nor <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> has commented on the reported meeting. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, 73, suffered a stroke Jan. 18 and spent eight weeks recuperating. He resigned as leader of the governing <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> on Feb. 2 and was replaced by <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, the minister of national education. The party's parliamentary caucus later announced it wanted <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> to become president to reunify the two positions. But <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, resisting pressure to retire after a decade in power, declared he would serve until the next general election and said there would be no early election this year. The deadline for the next election is March 1990. `` The mood in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is cautious relief and optimism,'' government-run television reported in an evening broadcast. It said the compromise was reached after `` senior Cabinet members played mediating roles.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> reluctantly agreed to the compromise `` after finally accepting that the <ORGANIZATION> Natonal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> no longer wants him, something reported to have hurt him deeply.'' The newspaper said an announcement about an early election date might be made in April. A meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> caucus is scheduled for April 8. The television report said an announcement was expected after Easter weekend. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, 53, has yet to break with any of <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s major policies, but he is widely viewed as more flexible and pragmatic than <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>.

<HEAD>New York Scrambles To Revamp Governing Board</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN SHANAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A day after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> signed a death warrant for the city's powerful Board of Estimate, officials were unsure Thursday whether the unusual governing body would linger, be reincarnated, leave a respectable heir or bequeath confusion upon voters. Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said he believes the board can go about its business until a replacement emerges. `` Based on normal constitutional law and actions by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on prior matters ... I believe the Board of Estimate, until the change occurs, is legal,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled that the board's make-up violates the one person-one vote principle because each of the city's five boroughs has one vote on the board although they range in population from <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>'s 377,600 to <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>'s 2.3 million. The <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estimate </ORGANIZATION> was set up 92 years ago and wields great power in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. It decides questions of land use, zoning, franchises and city contracts, and shares budget-making power with the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. The city has a $ 25 billion budget this year, and has to adopt a new one by June 30. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimroth </PERSON>, the city's chief lawyer, said courts usually give governments `` a reasonable period of time'' to make adjustments in such cases so as not to disrupt normal activities. One possibility is that residents could vote in a referendum for a new government structure in November, when the city has its next major election scheduled. That scenario could force voters to cast ballots for candidates without knowing what powers their offices would attain. All the positions on the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estimate </ORGANIZATION> _ mayor, city comptroller, <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> president and five borough presidencies _ are up for election. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said during a news conference with Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> that he was confident the city will restructure its government in a way that will hold up in court. `` It's an easier problem to deal with than drugs and AIDS,'' he remarked. And <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said of the court ruling, `` I do n't think it's a bad thing at all.'' He said the <ORGANIZATION> Charter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which was established in anticipation of the ruling, must be careful in addressing <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>'s participation in government. <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, the least typical borough with a higher proportion of homeowners and open spaces, and always prickly about being disregarded, risks the most in a revision. Borough President <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamberti </PERSON> already has spoken of secession if the island is left with only a weak voice in how the city is run. A spokesman for the governor of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> joked Thursday that <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> is welcome to become part of the Garden State. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said one way to conform to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling would be to keep the board and give the borough presidents votes weighted by population, but that would not give <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> the say it demands. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ravitch </PERSON>, former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Charter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and now a candidate for mayor, said last year he favored eliminating the board, which blends legislative with executive functions. He suggested giving its budget powers to the City Council, strengthening the role of the borough presidents in setting budget priorities and reducing the mayor's. He would set up a land-use review board, give zoning authority to the council and have mayoral agencies approve contracts. That would leave the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> as a unicameral legislature and the borough presidents functioning more like other county executives in the state. <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Vallone </PERSON> said he favors that kind of separation of powers. He said the court's decision `` reaffirms my confidence that a balanced and fair government will soon be in place in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.'' Officials must also take into account that any changes must conform to the federal Voting Rights Act by not diluting the voting power of minority group members. <PERSON> Gretchen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dykstra </PERSON>, spokesman for the charter commission, said the commission had set April 4 for public hearings on ideas for reconstruction of the board, but that date was picked before the court ruling and might change. She said it was expected that the commission would draw up its recommendations in time to put on the ballot as a referendum in November.

 A weeping <PERSON> Fawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> praised former boss <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> Thursday as an inspirational, tireless and selfless man and said their wholesale shredding of Iran-Contra documents `` was no big deal.'' Alternately crying and spitting back sharp responses, Miss <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> twice appeared unable to go on with her testimony at <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s trial, causing impromptu recesses. Her sympathies throughout were obviously with <PERSON> North </PERSON>, though she hardly ever looked at him. `` It's tough when people portray you as a witness for the prosecution when you are a witness for the truth,'' she said outside the courthouse. `` Hopefully, the good guy will win.'' She called North's firing by then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Nov. 25, 1986, unfair. `` I was very upset,'' she recalled. `` When I heard about it, I was very angry.'' Miss Hall, who was <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s secretary at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> for nearly four years, admitted that when attorney general's investigators were closing in on Nov. 21, 1986, she altered documents to soften recorded versions of <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s involvement with the Nicaraguan Contras She also said she helped him in what has been called `` a shredelease of American hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and that profits were to be diverted to the Nicaraguan Contras. He said he worked out a price sheet for 240 missile parts, tacking on a $ 2.70 profit for each $ 1 cost. <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> testified that he and <PERSON> North </PERSON> made arrangements that if <PERSON> North </PERSON> were taken hostage in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, `` that I was to go into his safe ... and destroy contents of the bottom drawer.'' He was not asked what was in the drawer. The jurors were given a four-day weekend for Good Friday and Easter and <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> is expected back on the stand Tuesday. Also next week, former Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> is to be a witness, before the prosecution rests its case. The slender, blonde Miss Hall, who became an instant celebrity when she testified in the televised congressional hearings in 1987, proved a magnet at the North trial as well. The public lines outside the courtroom were longer for her appearance than at any previous time during the trial which began on Jan. 31. She said many work days at the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> offices in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> complex would begin at 8 a.m and go until 1 a.m., but <PERSON> North </PERSON> was unflagging. `` He was tireless. I'm half his age at least,'' said the 29-year-old Hall at one point. `` I would be almost falling asleep at the typewriter and he would still be going.'' North is 45. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> gently led her through her experiences, asking about the `` thousands and thousands and more thousands of questions'' she had been asked. `` Do you always try to tell the truth?'' he asked. `` Absolutely yes,'' she replied. She said she was not positive which documents she altered and which she smuggled out of the building. `` It was n't lock door, pull down windows, pull down the shades,'' she said of the scene at the shredding. `` It was no big deal.''

<BYLINE>Walesa Not Ruling Out Candidacy for Parliament ^By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said Thursday he would rather not run for a seat in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s new parliament, but he said he would if the people want him to. He also said his banned independent union movement will look for answers `` in the streets and by strikes'' if no final agreement on reforms is reached at historic talks between the opposition and Communist leaders. Neither will Solidarity tolerate `` tricks'' by officials in implementing an accord, he said. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> made the statements at a news conference in his home city of <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> and in a subsequent telephone interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. At the talks in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, negotiators continued to discuss economic and political topics separating the two sides. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s comments cast doubt on whether a final agreement could be signed April 3 as planned. He said he would need about a week to study the document, which could be hundreds of pages long. `` I must familiarize myself with the entire material. ... Even if it takes more time, it will be understood, because we must do it well,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said. A decision to run for the existing parliament or for a newly created senate would depend `` on the wish of the voters,'' he said. `` I do n't want to be a candidate. But there are situations when one must do it,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said later by telephone. `` But I really would not like to, simply because there are many people better than me.'' Elections with opposition participation are part of the far-reaching compromise authorities are seeking at the talks. In exchange for legalization, Solidarity would agree to elections that guarantee in advance that a Communist-led coalition would get 65 percent of the existing parliament seats. But the new senate would be fully democratic, with opposition candidates running against Communist-approved candidates for the first time in the East bloc. Although Solidarity has said it would support candidates in elections to the existing parliament, tentatively planned for June, most union officials have said they would prefer to concentrate on union issues. Some Solidarity activists also have expressed concern privately that the union might not be able to find candidates quickly enough to run for the 35 percent of the 460 seats to be open to the opposition, and for the 100 or so seats contemplated for the new senate. `` There may be, for example, a situation when I'll have to agree -LRB- to run -RRB- because other people refuse,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said in the telephone interview. `` But I really do n't want to.'' Solidarity, the first independent union in the Soviet bloc, was born in 1980 and banned after martial law was imposed in 1981.

 A 21-year-old man was ordered held without bail Thursday after surrendering to police in the `` vicious, savage killing'' of a 13-year-old neighbor girl whose battered body was found in his basement. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Golub </PERSON> was arraigned on the murder charge shortly after his arrest in the slaying of <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinyes </PERSON> in the quite suburban neighborhood their families had shared for 11 years. `` We have forensic evidence at the scene that points to <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Golub </PERSON>. ... All of the evidence we do have points to him,'' <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Chief of Detectives <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Seay </PERSON> said Thursday. <PERSON> Seay </PERSON> said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>'s 14-year-old brother, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Golub </PERSON>, a onetime schoolmate of <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>'s, is still a suspect as well and the investigation is continuing. Authorities did not speculate on a possible motive. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, an eighth-grader, was last seen entering the <PERSON> Golub </PERSON> house, a few doors down from her home, in <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stream </LOCATION> on March 3. Her body was found in the basement there a day later. She had been stabbed with a World War I bayonet, strangled, slashed, kicked and punched by her killer, authorities said. The bayonet was recovered, <PERSON> Seay </PERSON> said. The <PERSON> Golub </PERSON> family, which had been staying with friends since shortly after the killing, were cursed at and forced to leave after they tried to return home Saturday night. Among the crowd of about 40 who screamed `` Monsters!'' and `` Seed of the devil!'' at the Golubs were some of <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>'s relatives. The family, described by neighbors as remote, had lived in the home for 11 years, while the <PERSON> Tinyes </PERSON> family had lived on the street for 13 years. The slain girl's parents, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinyes </PERSON>, stood quietly in a courtroom hallway as <PERSON> Golub </PERSON> was arraigned Thursday. `` This defendant is charged with the vicious, savage killing of a 13-year-old girl,'' said Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Cotter </PERSON>. `` It may not be the worst in the county's history, but it ranks right up there,'' <PERSON> Cotter </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Court Judge <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> accepted <PERSON> Cotter </PERSON>'s request that <PERSON> Golub </PERSON> be held without bail, pending a court appearance next Wednesday. <PERSON> Golub </PERSON>, an unemployed onetime truck driver, entered an innocent plea through his attorney, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Grady </PERSON>. <PERSON> Seay </PERSON> said a bloody palm print that was found on a doorway near <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>'s body was tentitively identified as belonging to <PERSON> Golub </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> was analyzing it to confirm the identification. In the three weeks since the slaying, police checked a variety of leads but `` We kept coming back to him -LRB- <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Golub </PERSON> -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Seay </PERSON> said, adding the story the murder suspect told them shortly after the slaying did n't check out. <PERSON> O'Grady </PERSON> said <PERSON> Golub </PERSON> maintained his innocence in the slaying on Wednesday night when they discussed his pending surrender. `` What are you going to do? I did n't do it,'' the attorney quoted <PERSON> Golub </PERSON> as saying.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to consider a partial lifting of the freeze on aid to <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, sources in the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> said Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is now consulting with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about the timing of such a move in light of recent steps taken by <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s military rulers to guarantee free elections, said the officials, all of whom requested anonymity The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> suspended $ 78 million in aid to the government of the impoverished <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> nation in November 1987 to protest a massacre that disrupted elections. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> left in place about $ 25 million in aid to private Haitian groups for health, education and other humanitarian projects. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s proposal would give the Haitian government about $ 8 million worth of wheat that had been held up by the aid suspension, said a congressional source. The government would be allowed to sell the wheat and use the proceeds to create badly needed jobs, he said. `` The sentiment here is to wait a while and see if President -LRB- Prosper -RRB- <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> follows through on his promises for elections,'' said the source. `` We're not that far apart from the administration on this. It's a question of timing,'' he added <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>, who assumed power in a September 1988 coup, promised last month to set up a nine-member electoral council to fix an election date and set conditions for the balloting. A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> source said that if <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> follows through on his promise and names the commission in the coming days, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> may agree to `` reward him with a small amount of that aid.''

<TEXT>
 Adoptive parents, childless couples and people abused as children wrote hundreds of letters urging a judge to give <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> maximum punishment for beating his illegally adopted daughter to death, sources said Thursday. The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said people from all over the country wrote to state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothwax </PERSON>, the judge who will sentence <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> on Friday. When asked to make the letters public, the judge said any letters received in the case already had been destroyed. The sources said letters also came from child advocacy groups and domestic violence projects, including a <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> organization responsible for a writing campaign of more than 100 letters. Not one of the letters recommended mercy for <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, the sources said, and some demanded the death penalty, which <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> does not have. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, 47, was convicted Jan. 30 of first-degree manslaughter in the November 1987 beating death of 6-year-old <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>. A disbarred lawyer, <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> got the child at birth from an unwed teen-ager and raised her as his own rather than arranging for the baby's adoption as he had promised. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> was acquitted of a more serious charge of second-degree murder. The maximum sentence he faces is eight and one-third to 25 years in prison. If <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> is sentenced to the maximum, he would be eligible for parole in less than seven years because he already has been jailed for nearly 17 months since his arrest. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Reich </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> will address the court before sentencing. `` <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> wants the judge to assess his humanity to see his sorrow at <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s death and to feel he is worthy of redemption,'' <PERSON> Reich </PERSON> said. `` He's simply going to express himself as a human being.''

 A potentially unfavorable court decision to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> has the borough threatening to secede, and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> officials joked Thursday they would welcome their neighbors across the water. `` An awful lot of people think it's part of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> already,'' said <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Golden </PERSON>, a spokesman for Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Huber </PERSON>, a spokesman for Borough President <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamberti </PERSON>, said any talk of secession by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s smallest borough remains premature. If the borough's nearly 400,000 residents did leave <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, it would be to form their own county and not to join <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Huber </PERSON> said. `` We would n't consider <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Huber </PERSON> said, adding that <PERSON> Lamberti </PERSON> commissioned a study two years ago that showed <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> could be a self-sufficient body. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled Wednesday that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s Board of Estimate violated the Constitution's one-person, one-vote principle. The court upheld a lower court ruling that required the city to develop a plan giving greater voting weight to larger boroughs. <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> is by far the city's smallest borough. The board, which rules on issues ranging from land-use to sewage rates, is comprised of the five borough presidents and the mayor, comptroller and <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> president. The latter three each have two votes. <PERSON> Huber </PERSON> said the borough would await a decision by the <ORGANIZATION> Charter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, appointed by Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> to revise city policy after the lower court decision. `` Do we want a board overwhelmingly made up of people who do n't live here? <PERSON> Huber </PERSON> asked. `` That would n't be fair.'' <PERSON> Golden </PERSON> said with a laugh that he did not want <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> accused of pirating an entire borough. `` It would be nice to get another member for the congressional delegation,'' <PERSON> Golden </PERSON> said. `` If they want to join <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, they're more than welcome.'' Just across a small body of water from <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> is the township of <LOCATION> Woodbridge </LOCATION>, a popular place for the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> residents, according to Mayor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> DeMarino </PERSON>. Many <ORGANIZATION> Staten </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islanders </ORGANIZATION> work in <LOCATION> Woodbridge </LOCATION> and use the large mall there as a place to shop. But <PERSON> DeMarino </PERSON> said he does n't expect the two groups to share the same state name any time soon. `` I do n't think anybody's talking about coming over to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` You know, secession's not as easy as it sounds.''

<HEAD>Paper Says Entrepreneurs Arm Employees Against Criminals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Criminals are demanding protection money from new profit-making cooperatives, police ca n't stop them and the workers have begun arming themselves, Pravda reported Thursday. Those who operate the semi-private cooperatives must choose between knuckling under or fighting back, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said. It quoted a police chief as saying: `` The population is arming itself.'' `` People are making guns and bombs right at work,'' said the chief, who was not identified. `` And you know how they explain it? Self-defense.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> acknowledges that new economic opportunities and social change introduced by President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> have brought more crime. Pravda said the murder rate rose 14 percent last year and armed robberies increased by more than 40 percent. Professional criminals are multiplying in a `` renaissance of robber traditions,'' and organized crime benefits from the new atmosphere, it said. The newspaper attributed almost 20,000 crimes in 1987-88 to 2,607 organized groups, of which 50 acted in `` deep conspiracy'' for more than three years. Gangs have souped-up cars, computers, bugging devices and hidden video cameras at their disposal, while police work with outdated equipment and insufficient enthusiasm, the article said. Many cooperatives hire policemen away from the force to serve as guards, Pravda declared, sometimes tripling their pay and providing up to 34 vacation days a year. Organized crime also causes increased corruption in the justice system, the party paper said. `` Underground millionaires and policemen, robbers and prosecutors, judges and speculators, party workers and ` godfathers' often end up in the same boat together'' at conviction time, it said Pravda criticized the revised criminal code now under consideration. Although the new code would humanize the system, the paper said, it would benefit criminals at the expense of their victims. Changes in the code would provide more alternatives to prison sentences, such as house arrest and community service, and reduce the number of capital crimes. According to the Pravda report, police would not have a way to arrest leaders of organized crime rather than those who merely follow orders. It quoted a detective named <PERSON> Y. </PERSON> <PERSON> Myslovsky </PERSON> as saying `` our hearts sank'' when he and other investigators learned of the new provisions. Cooperatives are open to extortion because framers of current laws never dreamed enterprises in a communist state would produce enough profit to make the protection racket worthwhile. Although police have formed anti-racketeering units and the law is being revised, `` while you're all discussing new legislation around here, I'm buying a gun,'' Pravda quoted a cooperative worker as saying. `` The racketeers have driven me crazy, and the police wo n't defend me,'' he said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> introduced cooperatives to spur individual enterprise and help fill gaps in poor state-run services and production of consumer goods. Their prices are not set by the state, and many cooperatives sell scarce items for high profits on which taxes are comparatively low. They are praised for initiative but sometimes censured for buying up goods meant for the general public. Cooperatives also have been accused of developing their own rackets and bribing officials to get permits and supplies.

<HEAD>Smith Bill Would Protect Logging Even If Owl Listed As Endangered</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Legislation aimed at ensuring that logging in the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> would not be interrupted for at least five years even if the spotted owl was listed as an endangered species was introduced Thursday. Rep. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, R-Ore., said the five-year period would allow time for wildlife biologists to determine whether the owl, believed to inhabit only ancient forests, was really threatened with extinction `` There is not enough evidence, at this time, to say whether the owl is endangered,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said at a news conference. He said the legislation would not prohibit the owl from being listed as an endangered species either by the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> or a federal court, but would keep such a listing from effecting timber sales. `` This is the most moderate kind of an answer to a difficult situation,'' said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. The owl has become the focal point of an increasingly bitter debate in the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> over protecting old-growth timber. Environmentalists have sought to have the bird listed under the federal Endangered Species Act, while the timber industry has insisted that such a designation could halt logging in vast areas of the <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> and result in the loss of thousands of jobs. The Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> had previsouly refused to list the owl for protection, but a federal court in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> has given the agency until May 1 to review its decision. A <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> report released last month concluded that the agency's decision not to protect the bird was based more on politics than on scientific evidence.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it has a new 55-page handbook to help farmers, shippers and local communities facing the loss of railroad service. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> `` Buzz'' <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, head of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>, said the handbook contains information on rural rail assistance from a number of sources and summarizes regulations as these apply to rail abandonments. `` Many of the light-density branch lines being cast off are located in agricultural regions,'' he said. `` Without rail transportation, the marketing options of local producers are limited.'' The topics include abandonments, alternatives to abandonment, and guidelines for evaluating the possibility of small railroad operations. Information is included for potential buyers who have little or no railroad experience. <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON> said many, if not all, of the major railroad companies have programs or plans for assisting in line sales. And many of those have worked with rural communities and shippers to explore ways of retaining rail service. This information is also in the handbook, he said. Copies of the booklet are being sent to federal, state and local organizations involved in rural railroad service assistance, he said. A limited supply is available free of charge for general distribution. For more information, contact: <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Batson </PERSON>, USDA-OT, P.O.

 Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> on Thursday accused <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> of ignoring its commitment not to interfere in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will take firm steps to protect its citizens in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. In an interview with the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> signed the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords in April with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> only because the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> believed that outside interference, mostly from Pakistan-supported rebels, `` would be completely discontinued.'' Soviet military forces completed their withdrawal Feb. 15 under the U.N.-mediated agreement after more than nine years of direct involvement in a civil war that began with a communist coup in April 1978. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said that despite the Soviet pullout, the civil war in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> continues to rage. `` In order to understand why, one should turn to the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreements again. And then, one will see that the clause on ending interference in Afghan domestic affairs has been completely ignored by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> had grossly violated the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement by allowing the creation of an interim government on its territory, known as `` the Alliance of Seven.'' He said the agreement also specifically prohibits arms being delivered to Afghan rebels. Most of the weapons have come from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> via <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. `` I shall note again that if weapons were delivered not via <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, then, speaking from the legal viewpoint, there would be no violation of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords,'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said. `` But, the matter is that practically all the armaments are supplied from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was fully prepared to discontinue arms shipments to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, `` but we will not agree to unilateral steps.'' He said fierce fighting was raging outside the city of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> but said Afghan forces were repelling the rebels. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> also said a large number of Soviet civilian specialists remained in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> as well as the staff of a large embassy. `` Any attempts to encroach upon their security will draw a most resolute Soviet response,'' he said without elaboration.

<TEXT>
 Soviet Ambassador <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON> on Thursday assailed <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s plan to modernize its short-range nuclear missiles as an unacceptable impediment to the improvement of East-West relations. <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON>, at a news conference, also said he hoped a date would be set for the resumption of U.S.-Soviet negotiations to reduce long-range nuclear missiles when Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> visits <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in May. `` We are ready,'' <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> plan to extend the range of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Lance missiles is running into obstacles even within the ranks of the Western alliance. West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, with support from some other allied leaders, is seeking a delay. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is determined to go ahead but still has to persuade <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, whose chance for re-election next year may hinge on the missile issue in a country where disarmament forces are strong. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, is unlikely to fund the modernization with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> on the fence. Asked about improving the Lances, <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON> said: `` It's unacceptable, at any rate, not for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> but for the process we are talking about It's just something which is going against the mainstream of peaceable development of the world. It's something which goes against the process of disarmament. <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON> added: `` There's absolutely no need to do it, because we have begun in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> a historic process of reducing forces, unilaterally by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and multilaterally in negotiations.'' In any event, he said, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will not modernize its own battlefield nuclear weapons. `` We are strongly in favor of beginning negotiations to eliminate this class of weapons, too.'' Apart from the Lance missile issue, <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON> fielded questions about U.S.-Soviet relations in a way that reflected a warming trend in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> under President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. He said the Soviet leader probably would see <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> when he goes to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in the first half of May to hold a second meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON> described <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s first talk with <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, which was held March 7 in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, as `` a successful one'' and `` the beginning of a new, active period of Soviet-American relations.'' U.S.-Soviet negotiations to reduce long-range nuclear missiles were tentatively scheduled to resume in mid-February in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. But President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ordered a postponement and the administration is reviewing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy. Asked if the delay set back prospects for a treaty, <PERSON> Dubinin </PERSON> said: `` The delay is a delay. It's absolutely clear. But we understand the new administration needs some time to get things together. It's understandable.

 Rubella has almost vanished in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since a vaccine was licensed 20 years ago, but federal health officials said they are concerned over the large proportion of the remaining cases that may occur among women of childbearing age. Although the main symptom of rubella, also known as German measles, is a mild rash, if it attacks pregnant women it can cause serious birth defects. During the last major rubella epidemic, in 1962-64, there were 12.5 million cases reported in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, including 20,000 babies born with the disease and 11,000 fetal deaths. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> said people 15 and over accounted for 58.2 percent of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rubella cases from 1985-87.

 Researchers are using radio waves to treat patients with uncontrolled rapid heartbeats, a method they say is safer and less painful than other techniques. Radio wave energy can be applied to the heart in smaller, more controlled doses than electricity, doctors say, slowing rather than cutting the cardiac electrical connection that causes rapid heartbeats, allowing certain patients to escape the need for pacemakers. The method destroys offending heart tissue with only 30 to 40 volts of energy and can be done with local anesthetic. Researchers also said the radio wave technique is safer than an older method of electrical shock because it does n't reset the heart's electrical activity or risk burning a hole in the heart. The research was reported during the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cardiology </ORGANIZATION>'s annual meeting, which ended Thursday.

 A study suggests accident proneness in children appears to be a phase, rather than a long-term characteristic, raising the possibility that injuries can be prevented by identifying susceptible youngsters. Researchers studied 54,874 school children ages 6 to 18 over a three-year period in an <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> school district during school hours and recorded 8,429 injuries. Seventeen percent of the injuries occurred to 1 percent of the children, a significantly higher rate than could be expected from chance alone. Injuries were most likely to recur among junior high school boys, children engaged in athletic activities and youngsters attending schools with longer hours or who were engaged in alternative programs, such as `` open'' classrooms or `` magnet'' curricula, the researchers said. The researchers was published in the March issue of the American Journal of Diseases of Children.

 An end to cocaine use during the first three months of pregnancy can reduce odds that the baby will suffer physical damage, but does not appear to reduce the risk of neurological problems, a study says. Between Jan. 1, 1986 and Feb. 2, 1988, researchers studied 125 women: 52 who used cocaine throughout their pregancy, 23 who stopped using the drug during the first trimester and 40 with no history or evidence of drug use. Many babies born to women in the second group escaped physical problems found in those whose mothers used cocaine until delivery. But babies whose mothers were in either of the cocaine-use groups suffered significant neurobehavioral response deficiencies. In addition to lack of responsiveness and alertness, researchers found impairments in orientation, motor ability and ability to regulate behavior. The study was published in Friday's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Argentine Navy Ends Oil Spill Cleanup Efforts, Claims No Damage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Deteriorating weather has forced the Argentine navy to halt efforts to clean up a fuel oil spill from a ship that went aground Jan. 28 near an American Antarctic research station. A statement released Thursday by the <ORGANIZATION> Argentine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said that five Argentine naval ships that had been participating in contamination control work were being withdrawn `` due to glacier and meteorological conditions.'' The statement said that oil spilled from the Argentine supply ship <LOCATION> Bahia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paraiso </LOCATION> has been removed from the sea surface and that all `` potential pollutants'' have been removed from the wrecked ship. American experts, however, say about 50,000 gallons of fuel oil are still aboard the <ORGANIZATION> Bahia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paraiso </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Talmadge </PERSON> said that `` there has never been ship with oil in it that withstood an <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> winter.'' `` We're concerned about what might happen over the winter,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Bahia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paraiso </ORGANIZATION> lodged on rocks on <LOCATION> DeLaca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> near the Palmer station and dumped about 170,000 gallons of diesel and jet fuel into the pristine waters nearby. An American research camp called <LOCATION> Palmer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> is 1.1 miles away. Experts from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> stopped further leaks from the vessel and cleaned up much of the oil, but the Argentine navy now is leaving the scene while tons of fuel remain in the <LOCATION> Bahia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paraiso </LOCATION> tanks. <PERSON> Talmadge </PERSON> said the vessel could quite likely be susceptible to shifting by the force of ice and tide through the winter. The approaching Antarctic winter will not halt American efforts, <PERSON> Talmadge </PERSON> said, because the <ORGANIZATION> NSF </ORGANIZATION> icebreaker <PERSON> Polar </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> is able to operate out of <LOCATION> Palmer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> in virtually all seasons. The Argentine statement also claimed that `` no visible harm to the local ecosystem was noticed, especially with respect to its fauna.'' But experts at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, which operates the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> research program in the region, said that the spill of fuel oil from the <LOCATION> Bahia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paraiso </LOCATION> did cause some loss of wildlife in the area near <LOCATION> Palmer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION>, and that the eventual impact of the spill may not be known for years. An extra team of American scientists went to <ORGANIZATION> Palmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> earlier this month to conduct new studies on the effects of the fuel oil spill. They are expected to return in April. <ORGANIZATION> NSF </ORGANIZATION> scientists have been monitoring the effects of the spill since the ship first went aground and have reported: _ Among a population of 30,000 birds of at least eight species, fewer than 30 are known to have died directly as a result of ingesting the fuel oil However, there is indirect evidence of other losses. _ Penguins returning to the sea after nesting were forced to swim through oil-covered water Some penguins now are apparently being eaten at sea by giant petrels, a long-winged bird. `` This diet, unusual for petrels, is evidence that the oil spill affected penguins,'' an <ORGANIZATION> NSF </ORGANIZATION> statement says. _ An entire generation of South Polar skuas died in one rookery near <LOCATION> Palmer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> The skua is a gull-like bird of prey. NSF experts said skua parents were apparently affected by the oil spill and failed to protect their nestlings from other skuas and other predatory birds. There are, however, many skua rookeries in the South Polar region. _ The loss most feared by scientists is that the area around <LOCATION> Palmer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION>, which has been a science outpost for 20 years, may no longer be suitable for study because of distortions caused by the oil spill `` The usefulness of ... Palmer Station for basic research -LRB- of -RRB- the undisturbed <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> ecosystem is in question,'' an <ORGANIZATION> NSF </ORGANIZATION> statement said.

 Prominent women from <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinem </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Martina </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Navratilova </LOCATION> to <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> say they are worried about a backlash against <PERSON> Hedda </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> from those who believe she shares the blame for the death of <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>. `` Blaming victims will not save their lives,'' says a statement they signed along with actresses <PERSON> Roseanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> and <PERSON> Colleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dewhurst </PERSON>, singer <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, writer <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Oates </PERSON> and some 300 others. Organizers planned to present the statement Friday when <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> is sentenced for first-degree manslaughter in the death of 6-year-old <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>, the girl he raised with his battered companion, Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>, who was illegally obtained at birth by <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> from an unwed teen-ager, was removed comatose from the couple's apartment on Nov. 2, 1987, and died of a brain injury three days later. Prosecutors originally charged both <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> in the death, but later dropped charges against the woman when they concluded she was too badly battered herself to have saved the child. Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> has been hospitalized for physical and mental problems for most of the time since <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s death, and she became a key witness against <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> at his trial. `` We're concerned about the rising backlash ... which says <PERSON> Hedda </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> got away with something,'' said novelist <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>, who drafted the statement in the face of controversy over Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>'s role Ms. magazine carried a a variety of views on the dispute in its April edition, including an essay by author <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Brownmiller </PERSON>, who said, `` Many of us old-warrior feminists who followed the case from the beginning thought that <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> should have been standing trial as well, for reckless endangerment of a child, at least.'' Those who signed the statement argued that whether or not Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> was culpable, the controversy could divert attention from battered women who genuinely need help. `` I got into an argument with a woman defense lawyer and two female judges about this. Even these people, who should know better, do n't understand that <PERSON> Hedda </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> was a victim,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>, the former congresswoman and vice presidential candidate. `` We do n't know how to deal with these women yet,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>, who prosecuted both child abusers and wife-beaters when she was an assistant district attorney. `` They are all people who have been preyed upon and who find themselves in a situation they can not get out of; they are generally misunderstood.'' The statement says the <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> case `` has forced open the door between family violence and our conscience as a civilized society.'' It calls for help for women to escape family violence; methods to stop men from beating women and children; and acknowledgement of the `` enormous social and economic toll'' of domestic violence. It said women and children fleeing violence account for 40 percent of the city's homeless. `` This letter is done to remind people there are very few escape hatches for women who try to flee: no funding, few services,'' said <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Chesler </PERSON>, a psychologist and author. `` Rather than blame one woman because we may disagree with her, -LRB- the letter -RRB- reaffirms the larger point: Our duty is to protect women and children from being battered and help them escape, rather than to discuss, ` In what ways is she really to blame?'' Ms. <PERSON> Chesler </PERSON> said.

 Guerrillas blew up a bridge on the only paved road to <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, the government said Thursday. The bombing disrupted supplies to the city the guerrillas chose as their first major objective after the Soviet withdrawal. A Foreign Ministry spokesman said three other roads, all unpaved and more circuitous, remained open to military convoys between <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and the strategic city 75 miles to the east near the Khyber Pass. <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> told reporters the bridge near <LOCATION> Sarobi </LOCATION>, about midway between the capital and <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, was destroyed Tuesday by explosives planted on the span. He said the bridge was one of about 100 on the paved highway. Moslem insurgents based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and supported by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> launched their offensive around the eastern city March 6 but have not succeeded in dislodging government troops. Soviet military forces completed their withdrawal Feb. 15 under a U.N.-mediated agreement, after more than nine years of direct involvement in a civil war that began with a communist coup in April 1978. <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s airport is the terminus for military supplies from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which the Kremlin-sponsored government says will continue arriving until the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> stops supplying the guerrillas. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said the guerrillas fired 2,000 rockets and artillery shells at government positions outside <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> in the previous 24 hours. No government soldiers were killed, but five troopers and five civilians were wounded, he said. He claimed 89 guerrillas, including four local commanders, were killed in the same period. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> repeated his government's claims that Pakistani military personnel were aiding the insurgents, who call themselves mujahedeen, or holy warriors. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s neighbor to the east, has denied such involvement. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> accused <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> of ignoring its commitment not to interfere in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. He said <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> had grossly violated the U.N.-mediated agreement by allowing the rebels to form an interim government on its territory. He also charged that arms were being delivered to the rebels from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> via <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> in violation of the accord. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> noted a large number of Soviet civilian specialists remained in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> as well as the staff of a large embassy. `` Any attempts to encroach upon their security will draw a most resolute Soviet response,'' he said without elaboration. In <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Afghan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> operated by the <ORGANIZATION> Hezb-e-Islami </ORGANIZATION> rebel group of <PERSON> Gulbaddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> claimed army outposts north and west of the city were captured. Reports on casualties and the progress of fighting around <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> are impossible to verify from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. Guerrilla headquarters in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> have reported far lower death tolls for the mujahedeen. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said soldiers were conducting a `` mopping-up operation'' against insurgents near <LOCATION> Khak-e-Jabbar </LOCATION>, 15 miles southeast of the capital on one of the alternate routes to <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>. Blowing up the bridge could signal a change of mujahedeen tactics in the 17-day-old battle for <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, which illustrates the difficulty for guerrillas of direct confrontation with an army that has air power and long-ange missiles. Soviet-made Scud-B rockets have been fired daily from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> in the direction of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> since the battle bagan, according to foreign observers and residents of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. They have a range of at least 175 miles. A truck hauled three Scuds tightly wrapped in gray plastic through the center of the capital Thursday, accompanied by two other trucks carrying canisters of fuel that must be attached to fire the missiles. The trucks were seen on a major route from the airport, where Soviet Ilyushin-76 transports land several times a day. The huge planes can carry 40 tons of cargo. Thousands more Afghans have fled to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, further swelling a refugee population estimated at about 3.5 million. Refugee officials in <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION> said most were from villages in the <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> area, not from the city. Guerrilla and other sources said the government imposed a 24-hour curfew on <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> to avert an exodus. Insurgent leaders said they were reluctant to attack the city because of the civilian casualties it would cause.

 Officials criticized the British press Thursday for disclosing a secret <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> warning of a potential hijacking in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, but relatives of air terrorism victims said passengers have a right to know of such threats. Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said release of the warning compromises intelligence-gathering activities and jeopardizes airline passengers' safety. `` Hopefully no one will lose their life over this, but it is a very serious matter,'' he said. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> ordered the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> and a team of top aides now in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to investigate who leaked the warning to British news media. The <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> quoted from a copy of a March 16 <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> security bulletin which warned of a possible hijacking of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airliner during the upcoming Easter weekend. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>, which acknowledged issuing the bulletin after reports about it appeared in the Express and other <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> media, said, `` The release of this information by unauthorized persons can be counterproductive to the civil aviation community's efforts to provide a totally effective security system.'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said it is necessary to keep such bulletins secret to protect intelligence sources and, ultimately, the public. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> and other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials denied a <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> report that it warned government employees against flying in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> during the Easter weekend. But several relatives of victims of the Dec. 21 bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> said they believe the way the government handles terrorism bulletins has the effect of warning diplomatic and military personnel while keeping other potential passengers uninformed about risks. The relatives, in telephone interviews, criticized government reluctance to provide the public with information about terrorist warnings. British investigators have concluded that a terrorist bomb concealed in a radio-casettee player blew up Flight 103, killing all 259 people aboard and 11 others on the ground in <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. `` We do n't think they should use the American public as live bait,'' said <PERSON> Colleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hermann </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, whose brother <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahern </PERSON> was killed on Flight 103. <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ammerman </PERSON>, a spokesman for the relatives of <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> victims, said the group is not calling for general public announcements everytime there is a terrorist threat. But he said until `` prudent security measures'' can be taken to protect American carriers, a number should be set up for travellers to call to get information on any threat against a flight they plan to take. `` I do n't think that's going to paralyze the aviation industry,'' said <PERSON> Ammerman </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Demarest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, whose brother, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>, was killed in the Pan Am bombing. Another victim's relative, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodson </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, lawyer who lost his 16-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Melina </PERSON>, said the present security system amounts to a selective warning system. `` This whole thing gives us a feeling of deja vu,'' he said, referring to the secret warnings passed around among government and aviation officials before the <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> explosion. `` What happens when this information is kept secret and yet is passed around to literally thousands of security people is that it is bound to leak out and hurt the credibility of security. It then tends to sow panic even among those not directly threatened,'' <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> aviation consultant, said if all threats were made public, they might become so commonplace that people would simply ignore them. `` With 600 or so threats a year, you'd be crying wolf all the time,'' he said. Officials say all but a handful of threats are hoaxes. Sherry Price, a consultant at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Victims </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, which works with victims of violent crimes, said fears that warnings may disrupt commercial aviation are unfounded. `` They're not giving the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public the credit it deserves,'' she said. `` People are still going to go on airplanes, but I need to have the right to cancel my plans rather than cancel my life.''

<HEAD>Two Armenian Nationalists Sent to Prison for Airport Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two Armenian nationlists were sentenced Thursday to 18 months in prison for leading a strike that closed the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> republic's main airport in July, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. It said <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gevoyan </PERSON> and <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pogosyan </PERSON>, both unemployed, were charged with inducing unlawful actions that closed Zvartnots airport for three days. Evidence was given during the two-month trial that the men, in Civil Aviation uniforms, urged people at a mass meeting of the banned <ORGANIZATION> Karabakh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to march on the airport and force the staff to strike. `` The demonstrators, arriving at Zvartnots airport, blocked the approaches to the airport and the buildings of the air terminal,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Takeoffs were prevented and the airport's functions were paralyzed, jeopardizing the safety of numerous airliners.'' An Ilyushin-86 airbus carrying 300 people was able to land safely `` only by a lucky chance,'' the agency reported. According to the evidence, the defendants directed the three-day demonstration and strike. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said they `` ignored all the efforts of airport authorities, of representatives of party and government bodies to persuade them to end the blockage of Zvartnots airport.'' `` Instead of that, the demonstrators' leaders continued to make absurd demands and threatened to take hostages,'' the news agency said. `` It is only due to the intervention of forces protecting law and order that the dangerous developments were disrupted. `` The defendants have been sentenced to the deprivation of freedom for 18 months and are to serve the term in a correctional labor colony with a general regime.'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the sentence can not be appealed. The <ORGANIZATION> Karabakh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> began a campaign in February 1988 to annex <PERSON> Nagorno </PERSON> <PERSON> Karabakh </PERSON>, a predominantly Armenian enclave in neighboring <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. At least 87 people died in ethnic riots and efforts by Soviet troops to quell violence between the Christian Armenians and the Moslem Azerbaijanis.

 Police clashed with ethnic <PERSON> Albanian </PERSON> demonstrators in the province of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> on Thursday after the local legislature approved constitutional changes that will weaken the region's autonomy. Police used tear gas and clubs to disperse up to 10,000 stone-throwing protesters in <LOCATION> Urosevac </LOCATION>, a town about 15 miles south of <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION>, witnesses and the state-run media reported. <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> radio said `` several'' police officers and demonstrators were injured. Witnesses said at least 100 demonstrators were detained. About 2,000 university students in <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION> tried to stage a similar protest, but riot police forced them back onto their campus. The ethnic Albanians were protesting the adoption of amendments designed to give the country's largest republic of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> greater control over the affairs of the southern province of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>. Most of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s people are <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> and Slavic, and most people in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> are Moslem and ethnic <PERSON> Albanian </PERSON>. The demonstrators in <LOCATION> Urosevac </LOCATION> chanted, `` We will give our lives, but we will not give up <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>,'' the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> reported. Of 188 deputies at the parliamentary session, only 10 voted against the constitutional changes and two abstained from the voting, conducted by a show of hands, <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said. About 80 percent of the deputies are ethnic Albanians, and it appeared they voted for the changes in response to pressure from the national government. More than 100,000 ethnic Albanians demonstrated last November in <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION>, the province's capital, and thousands walked off their jobs in February to protest the proposed amendments. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s federal presidency last month imposed a partial state of emergency in the province by banning all public gatherings and issuing `` compulsory work orders,'' which carry the weight of a call to reserve military duty. At least a dozen prominent ethnic <PERSON> Albanians </PERSON>, including <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s former <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Azem </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlasi </PERSON> _ a bitter political rival of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s party boss <PERSON> Slobodan </PERSON> <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> _ were arrested in the past month on suspicion of instigating protests Hundreds of police officers, including heavily armed riot squads with police dogs, patrolled <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION>'s streets during the parliamentary session Thursday. About 85 percent of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s 1.8 million residents are ethnic <PERSON> Albanian </PERSON>. A majority has opposed any moved to restrict the wide autonomy granted to the region by the 1974 federal constitution. The constitutional changes allow tighter control by <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> over the province's judiciary and police. They also make it unnecessary for <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s parliament to approve amendments to the Serbian constitution that affect the province. Previously, any changes to the Serbian constitution had to be approved by the legislatures of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> and the republic's other autonomous province, <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION> Serbian authorities have maintained the constitutional changes are necessary to protect <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s Slavic minority, which they say is harassed and forced to leave the region by ethnic Albanians. Ethnic Albanians have countered that Slavs are emigrating from the province because of the region's severe economic problems, which include a 30 percent unemployment rate. They also have expressed fears that by taking away <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s power to approve changes to the Serbian constitution, authorities could restrict such rights as the use of the Albanian language in official matters and education.

<TEXT>
 Rebels in <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> have promised a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> famine relief effort safe passage to rebel-controlled areas where hundreds of thousands of people face starvation, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official said Thursday. `` Operation Lifeline,'' the biggest effort of its kind in any developing nation, aims to deliver more than 100,000 tons of food to more than 1 million people in April, which has been designated a month of tranquillity in <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s civil conflict. The object of the operation is to deliver the food by train, truck, barge and air to remote areas in the south before seasonal rains and floods make transport routes impassable. The cost of the project is $ 132 million, $ 55 million of which still must be raised. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials have said more than 600,000 of the 2 million to 3 million people displaced by the civil war could die of starvation during the April-December rainy season unless they get help. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Children's Fund, said at a news conference that the <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> has promised safe passage to rebel-controlled areas in the south. He said both sides agreed to the presence of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> staff to assure international donors that the supplies are being used for the purposes intended. Also Thursday, <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> was appointed personal representative of Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> for relief in <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> held talks in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, with Sudanese rebel officials on allowing the relief convoys and airlifts, which already have started. He said they had indicated their acceptance of `` corridors of peace'' to allow transport of relief supplies. The rebels are fighting for more autonomy for the Christian and animist south from the Moslem-controlled government.

 <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> went home a free man Thursday, meeting his family minutes after a prosecutor announced he will not retry the man who was once three days away from execution for the 1976 killing of a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> policeman. `` I've been standing a twilight zone for the past 12 -LCB- years,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said after hearing the news. `` I was in that twilight zone until the door opened. Thank God it did.'' <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> said the case was dropped because there is not enough evidence to retry <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, who has served 12 -LCB- years in prison. A judge ordered his release two days ago on grounds his first trial was unfair. `` It's almost impossible to find sufficient, credible evidence to try a case that is 13 years old,'' <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> was convicted and sentenced to die in 1977 for the murder of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> police officer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, a crime to which another man has virtually confessed. The one-time drifter has unstintingly maintained his innocence. His case drew national attention after it was portrayed in the movie documentary `` The Thin Blue Line.'' <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> announced his decision as <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> was en route to <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> to rejoin his family. He is free on a $ 50,000 personal recognizance bond. In <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> walked off an airplane and kissed his mother, <PERSON> Mildred </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>. Both broke into tears. About 100 friends and well-wishers were at the airport to greet him. `` You're supposed to have a resurrection around Easter,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. `` I guess this is it.'' <PERSON> Errol </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, director of `` The Thin Blue Line,'' had to battle a contingent of reporters and photographers to get close to <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>. He and <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> then embraced. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, who appeared red-faced and grimacing as he got off the plane before hearing the news, was given an <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> cap and a lei made of daffodils. He then was taken to a private room in the airport. The <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in March threw the conviction out, saying <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> had n't gotten a fair trial because prosecutors suppressed evidence and witnesses lied on the stand. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, who was three days away from execution before his sentence was commuted in 1980 to life in prison, has repeatedly said he'd welcome a second trial His attorney, <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaffer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Vance </PERSON>'s action served the purpose. `` I think he -LRB- <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> -RRB- would probably agree with me that his name has been cleared, that he's been vindicated in the court proceedings,'' <PERSON> Schaffer </PERSON> said. He said he believes the national spotlight on the case probably forced <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> to drop it. But <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> defended prosecutors' actions, including a legal fight that temporarily held up <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' release earlier this week. `` The easy route would have been to release Mr. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> immediately. However, my obligation is not to the media or to play the part of the hero. My responsibility in every case is to the victim, his family, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> citizens and the state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> said. `` I think Mr. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> would be the first to admit to you that the justice system works. If it did n't he would be on death row.'' <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> said a motion to dismiss the capital murder charge has been filed with state District Judge <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Baraka </PERSON>, who initially recommended that <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> be retried. Pressure to re-examine the case grew after `` The Thin Blue Line'' raised doubts about the testimony of the state's key witness, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> had picked up <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> the day of the shooting after <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' car ran out of gas In the first trial, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> had pulled over <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' car and <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> shot the officer. In the documentary, however, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> changed his story. And in December he told <PERSON> Baraka </PERSON> that <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> did not shoot <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> provided so many details of the crime that the judge said he considered <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' testimony a virtual confession. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> is on death row for another slaying but was n't charged in the Wood case. The district attorney previously said his decision on whether to retry would hinge on prosecutors' ability to find two key witnesses _ a woman investigators had not spoken with in 13 years and a man who identified <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, but later claimed he had forgotten his original testimony. <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> said Thursday he does n't believe <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> confessed, and he does n't expect him to be tried for the Woods killing. Detective <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crimes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Persons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> said the case probably will not be reopened. Most of the officers who worked on the 1976 shooting have retired or left the force, he said. `` It's just too bad they can let a guy out because somebody makes a movie that is n't right,'' <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON> said. `` They -LRB- prosecutors -RRB- know best if they have a triable case or not. In this business you have to roll with the punches.''

<TEXT>
 Senior <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration and Japanese officials met Thursday to discuss the controversial FSX fighter after the chief <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman declared that the joint production arrangement is `` not a done deal.'' `` The president still has to make the basic decisions,'' press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had said he wants to proceed with the deal, but with modifications to help safeguard <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> technology and to assure that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> industry has a share in the plane's production. `` We've pretty much finished our deliberations here inside the administration. I've made my decision to go forward, with certain clarifications,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said at that time. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> announced that Japanese officials would be meeting later with Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> and national security adviser Brent Scowcroft to present their views on revisions being proposed by the administration. The Japanese government has called for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> approval of the original plan negotiated by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration with as few changes as possible. Japanese officials in the meeting at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> included Vice Minister <PERSON> Seiki </PERSON> <PERSON> Nishihiro </PERSON> of the Japanese <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Nobuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsunaga </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. After the talks, <PERSON> Matsunaga </PERSON> brushed past reporters to a waiting limousine, saying only: `` We agreed to continue meeting. I have nothing else to say.'' A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, who spoke on condition he not be identified, said the talks woill resume Friday. `` There is no conclusion, but there is no breakdown either,'' he said. The FSX deal is expected to be sent to <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> within the next few days. It could be blocked if both the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> pass resolutions of disapproval within 30 days of being formally notified of the agreement. The president, however, could then veto the congressional action, with a two-thirds majority required to override the veto. Under the agreement signed late last year, <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> would join with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heavy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> to co-develop and co-produce the FSX as an advanced version of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> F-16 fighter. Proponents argue the agreement represents the best deal the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could negotiate in the face of Japanese opposition to buying F-16s directly from this country. They say the deal will promote exchanges of technology while helping <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry. Critics contend the arrangement amounts to a giveaway of advanced technology that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> may use to help propel its civilian aircraft industry into head-to-head competition with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the world market. They say <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> should purchase American-made planes to help offset the $ 50 billion <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. On <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, a group of seven <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members led by Rep. <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, D-Calif., circulated a `` dear colleague'' letter saying they continue to have `` serious reservations'' about the FSX deal `` If the Japanese were serious about improving the defense of the northern <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, increasing their share of the defense burden and reducing their massive trade surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, they would buy these planes directly from us. `` Instead, they are getting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> technology on the cheap to develop their own aerospace industry _ an industry which could someday become a major competitor of its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> counterpart in advanced commercial aviation and space launch vehicles,'' the letter said. Also signing the letter were Reps. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif., <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> majority whip; <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on trade; <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mo </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Competitiveness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taskforce </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsui </PERSON>, D-Calif.; <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Mineta </PERSON>, D-Calif., and

 Some European airports stepped up security after receiving a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warning of a possible hijacking, but others reported business as usual on a busy Thursday. Authorities in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> said security had been tightened at airports because of the alert, but no additional precautions were reported in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>.

In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, officials said the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government offices were notified of the threat but had issued no warnings to the public. <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Bachmeier </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> authorities received `` a vague warning'' but declined to give details. He said his ministry regularly receives indications or warnings of planned terrorist attacks and that security officials routinely investigate them. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> played down the warning, saying it was similar to many other terrorist alerts and travelers `` should be confident that all reasonable precautions are being taken.'' The alert was disclosed in several <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> newspapers, including the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>, which published a photocopy of part of the warning it said had been received by <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. `` The public has been super. They understand the situation and are very cooperative,'' said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Buttenshaw </PERSON>, assistant public relations manager at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Gatwick </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, through which a quarter-million passengers were expected to pass during the four-day Easter weekend. Buttenshaw reported no flight delays because of stepped-up security, and spokeswoman <PERSON> Roz </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> airport also reported traffic moving smoothly Thursday afternoon. On Thursday morning, however, passengers waiting to board stood in long lines waiting to be checked through security. Security staff `` were very thorough and searched everything we were taking thorough, which we were pleased to see,'' said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, who was waiting for a flight at <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION>. Authorities in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> said security was tighter, but no special precautions were reported in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airline offices in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> reported few cancellations. `` In fact, we are keeping tabs on this, but there have been no unusual cancellations,'' said <PERSON> Daniela </PERSON> <PERSON> Travaglini </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> office. <PERSON> Rik </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirs </PERSON>, a Dutch national police spokesman, said the agency was `` looking into whether we can increase certain aspects of the security situation here based on the alert we got.'' In <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, a police spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity said `` security at the airport is always at a high state of alert.'' The French government said it had received the warning but had done nothing special about it. `` We do not wait for an <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> communique to take measures,'' said an <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. Nine people who work for <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Field </ORGANIZATION>'s, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> department store, changed their Paris-to-Chicago bookings for Friday from <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> to a foreign carrier, a <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Field </ORGANIZATION>'s executive said.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> reached agreement Thursday on a <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> policy statement that would renew aid to the U.S.-backed Contra rebels and establish the first broadly bipartisan approach to the region in years. `` There is a deal,'' said an administration official, speaking only on condition of anonymity. `` I think they've come together,'' said Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Obey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>., of the sides that Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> has been seeking to unite behind a new policy for the past several weeks <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> were expected to meet on the agreement Friday morning, then announce the new policy in an appearance with congressional leaders. The statement expresses support for Central American peace efforts and democratic goals, calls for the ultimate reintegration of the Contras into Nicaraguan political life and calls for an end to regional hostilities. While it mentioned no specific figure for continued aid to the rebels, money was to flow at the current rate of about $ 4 million a month, putting the aid package at roughly $ 40 million. Thursday on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> met first with <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrats, then with <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Republicans, then with <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> was in recess, and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was seeking to reach key senators out of town to secure final agreement. <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> leaders canceled other plans for Friday to be able to appear at the White House. Meanwhile, however, <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> supporters said they were concerned about an audit report detailing alleged killing, rape and torture of prisoners captured by the Contras, and they called for changes in the rebels' political directorate to ensure such abuses do not recur. The credibility of Contra leaders is at stake, said one lawmaker who supports the rebels, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` They've got a lot of housecleaning they have to do.'' <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> sources, also speaking on condition they not be named, said there was compelling circumstantial evidence that <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>, also the Contra military commander, had sought to cover up abuses or at least to prevent auditors from finding out about them. The audit performed for the <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, which administers the aid currently flowing to the rebels in their Honduran camps along the border with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, turned up the allegations during interviews late last year with 32 prisoners held at Contra stockades. The agreement on the policy statement by a majority of congressional Democrats and Republicans represented a sharp break with the recent history of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy in Central America in general and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in particular. It was the most consistently contentious foreign-policy subject during President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s two terms in office. The compromise policy statement would extend non-military aid to the anti-Sandinista rebels through Feb. 28, 1990, after <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s scheduled national elections The idea is to keep the rebels in place along the Nicaraguan border until they feel able to safely return to their homeland or decide to voluntarily disband. The current $ 27 million aid package expires March 31. `` I do think the administration is legitimate on this,'' said Obey, a severe skeptic of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration policy toward the region. A key to the progress was insertion of a provision Obey proposed that will allow any one of four congressional committees dealing with foreign affairs to put an end to the aid at the end of November, should lawmakers decide the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration was not adequately supporting regional peace efforts. Another provision stipulates that aid will end automatically should the Contras engage in military attacks or cross-border incursions, or evidence further human rights violations. The package also says the aid money can be used for `` regional relocation'' of the rebels. Obey said, `` Our expectation is that this will be in full support of the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidents'' who have been seeking to forge a regional peace settlement, most recently at a February meeting in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Their agreement there called for establishing a plan by mid-May to disband the 11,000-man Contra force and for the rebels to be reintegrated into <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> as political freedoms are re-established. Much of the two-page <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy statement, which had been stamped `` Secret'' and kept under close wraps by <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, consists of broad and general policy pronouncements reaffirming democratic goals for the region. Missing from the document are the kinds of harsh denunciations of the Sandinistas that characterized <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration rhetoric. Lawmakers gave credit to <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, a relative newcomer to the foreign-policy field, for earning their trust by sitting through long meetings with them, taking a non-ideological approach to the talks and offering sincere pledges of good faith. `` There's no question that he wanted to find the center of gravity and rest his policy on it,'' said Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Spratt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, a moderate Democrat who has been part of a group of `` swing'' voters on <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> aid in the past. `` He has been trying to build a policy based on political reality.'' `` He offered statements that he is going to not only be a party to make the agreements and peace accords work, but that he personally would work against any secret military involvement,'' added Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Stenholm </PERSON>, a conservative <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat. As for the audit on alleged torture by the Contras, it said female prisoners between the ages of 15 and 25 reported being `` raped and tortured by -LRB- Nicaraguan resistance -RRB- officials at the time of their detention so they would confess to being infiltrators.'' Male prisoners detained on suspicion of infiltration or sabotage and spying also contended they had been tortured when they were picked up and imprisoned in the log huts and barbed-wire enclosures, and one prisoner was killed during interrogation. Contra spokesman <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON> said a rebel tribunal was prosecuting at least one, and as many as four, suspects in the case, and would mete out appropriate punishment. `` We think it is tragic, lamentable,'' he said.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> said Thursday he will not call elections early, as the opposition and some others have predicted. `` I am ruling out a July election,'' he said in a radio interview. <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> has said he would let the government run its three-year term until May 1990, but critics said his tearful admission on television Tuesday that he had cheated on his wife of 33 years may have been a bid for sympathy and votes. The 59-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader has won an unprecedented three terms as prime minister and, in the past, has called elections early despite asserting he would not. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, leader of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, suggested last weekend that <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> might call elections in July, 10 months early. In the radio interview, his first public comment since the television confession, <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> said: `` The people that meet me are as enthusiastic as they've ever been.'' His approval rating has fallen to 48 percent, however, and a poll published Wednesday indicated the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> would have lost if national elections had been held earlier this month. The tabloid <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION> speculated that the promise of large tax reductions beginning July 1 indicate an election is coming. `` Political tacticians on both sides agree boosting the average pay packet by at least $ 30 -LRB- $ 25 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- a week will be electorally advantageous,'' it said. <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> is a former trade union leader who once was a heavy drinker. His public admission of infidelity and his promise to stay faithful were unexpected. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassidy </PERSON>, his press secretary, tried to counter the talk of electioneering, and <PERSON> Clive </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who interviewed <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> on television, said he thought the remarks were made off the cuff.

<HEAD>Peruvians Hope For End To Mail Strike</HEAD>

 A postal strike that has held up millions of letters from tax forms to love notes entered its 50th day Thursday, but officials said it could end next week. `` For two months I have not received the check that my son sent me from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. ... I am living on loans. I do n't know what else to do,'' said an elderly man waiting outside <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>'s central post office He and dozens of others lined up in hopes that their mail somehow got through. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, national mail director, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that workers tentatively agreed to end their strike Monday, but the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> had not publicly agreed to a settlement. Courier services such as <ORGANIZATION> DHL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worldwide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> said business has surged since the strike began. Some people have gone into business for themselves by placing newspaper ads offering to carry letters for mailing in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> for a $ 2 to $ 3 charge. Postal officials in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> said there has been no home delivery since the city's 570 letter carriers struck. A small number of other postal workers remain on the job, but the mail flow, especially arriving letters, has been reduced dramatically. Still, officials said, more than 10 million letters are piling up in post offices in the city. Four storerooms in the central office are filled to the ceiling with swollen mail pouches. The postal workers union struck Feb. 2 for higher wages to counter inflation, which hit 110 percent during the first two months of this year. The government decreed a 30 percent wage increase for public employees earlier this month, but the union said the raise was insufficient and continued the strike. <PERSON> Eugenio </PERSON> <PERSON> Medina </PERSON>, a 25-year postal veteran, said his current salary _ equivalent to about $ 31 a month _ is barely enough to `` change the soles of my shoes.'' The inflation has combined with a 9 percent shrinkage of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s economy last year to plunge the nation into its worst recession of the century There have been dozens of strikes, including walkouts by telephone workers, bank employees, social security personnel and <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>'s morgue staff. Mine workers announced a tentative strike for Monday. The government has argued that the wage increases demanded by workers will only cause higher inflation and do little to boost their spending power. Analysts say the weak economy and a relentless eight-year insurgency by leftist guerrillas have undermined government stability. President <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> began his five-year term in July 1985. His center-left government cut inflation and sparked two years of growth in 1986 and 1987 by using government dollar reserves to subsidize imports of food and consumer and industrial goods. The economy began to falter late in 1987 when the reserves were gone and the government continued its program despite a growing budget deficit, considered the major cause of inflation.

 <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s affluent households are becoming richer while the poor are drifting ever deeper into poverty, says a federal report that compared family incomes from 1973 through 1987. According to the study, released this week by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, the wealthiest 20 percent of the nation's households saw, on average, a 12 percent increase in income over the 15-year period, from $ 60,299 to $ 67,416 At the same time, the poorest fifth experienced an 8 percent drop, from $ 5,507 to $ 5,107. `` This widening disparity between rich and poor, particularly for families with children, is very disheartening,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Downey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION> and the chairman of the subcommittee on human resources. `` These families are not even standing still. They are losing ground.'' The biggest reason for the poor becoming poorer, the report says, was cuts in welfare programs. Aid to families with dependent children was reduced over 30 percent during the period; food stamp benefits and other social programs also were cut. An economist for the committee, who preferred not to be quoted by name, said statistics also show that more jobs paid poverty-level wages in 1987 than in 1979, midway through the survey period. He also pointed out that more families consist of never-wed mothers and their children. While the total number of Americans under 18 years of age decreased by about 800,000 from 1960 to 1987, from 63.7 million to 62.9 million, the number living with a never-married mother grew from 243,000 to 4.2 million. Statistics also show that, after adjusting for inflation, 80 percent of all single working-mothers earned less in 1987 than in 1979. In families with both a mother and father raising children, income among the poorest dropped 11.3 percent from 1973 to 1987, from $ 14,038 annually to $ 12,796, the report said. The good news in the report is for the elderly who, married or not, saw their incomes rise 20 percent to 30 percent, on average, from 1973 to 1987. These increases were explained by rising Social Security benefits and the fact that a greater portion of the elderly population collected pensions in 1987 than in 1973, the report said. The years 1973, 1979 and 1987 were used in calculating incomes for the study, `` Background Material and Data on Programs Within the Jurisdiction of the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION>,'' because they were peak years within economic cycles.

 Two hundred anti-abortion activists waving pictures of aborted fetuses were arrested as they blockaded a health clinic Thursday in the first of a series of Holy Week protests that have put police on alert. The arrests of the protesters and their 29-year-old leader, <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>, who was carried away in a fetal position, brought cheers and applause from 150 pro-choice advocates outside the clinic 20 miles east of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The anti-abortion protesters organized by Operation Rescue, many from out of state, clutched rosary beads, sang hymns and prayed as they were arrested by police at the <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> in suburban Cypress. Counterdemonstrators chanted `` Not the church, not the state, women will decide our fate'' and hoisted `` Freedom of Choice'' and `` Keep Abortion Legal'' signs. The pro-choice people began gathering at 7:15 a.m. to counter what New York-based Operation Rescue billed as its biggest anti-abortion protest since undertaking blockades of clinics that perform abortions two years ago. `` I just think somebody has got to do this. This is too big to ignore. We need to do something for our voices to be heard,'' said <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Otti </PERSON>, one of those who tried to block Operation Rescue members. Southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> was targeted for the pre-Easter `` <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Week </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION>,'' organizers said, because of its high abortion rate and many clinics. The 400 anti-abortionists participating in the Cypress protest sang the `` Battle Hymn of the Republic'' and `` Jesus Loves the Little Children.'' The anti-abortion advocates refused comment. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>, who had displayed what he said was an aborted 19-week-old fetus in a small white coffin at a Wednesday news conference, said he would n't make a statement until the media shows pictures of aborted fetuses which the activists usually display on posters. `` We do have a certain sense that media are not being fair with this issue because a lot of the media has not explained adequately the moral dilemma'' of equating a woman's right to have an abortion to a fetus' right to live, said <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> of Traditional Values, a group representing 6,000 churches. The arrested were booked for investigation of failing to disperse, a misdemeanor. Under <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>'s order, they went limp during arrests, requiring four police officers to drag each one to a bus that took them to Cypress City Hall. At one point the pro-choice advocates tried to block anti-abortion protesters who crawled to the clinic on hands and knees to replace comrades who had been arrested. Later, the police used pro-choice advocates to help them escort about 25 workers and abortion patients into the clinic as Operation Rescue members shouted to one teen-age girl entering, `` Reconsider. Keep your baby.'' Calls to the clinic were referred to a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> office, where a secretary said there would be no comment from management. However, anti-abortion activists said the clinic's owner was Dr. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allred </PERSON>, a frequent target because he owns a number of clinics in the area. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> officials who had expected protests by 2,500 people, were on alert in a city command center four floors under City Hall. Police, fire and sheriff's officials kept tabs on activity at clinics throughout <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, including the Her Medical Clinic near downtown, where 50 pro-choice advocates gathered. Operation Rescue members had vowed to risk arrest and defy a federal court order obtained by the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> that forbid protesters from blocking entrances or gathering within 15 feet of the clinic. In suburban <LOCATION> Inglewood </LOCATION>, police expecting protests there set up <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> race track as a temporary jail site, but it was n't needed The Operation Rescue protest was supported by Archbishop <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahony </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archdiocese </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>.

 `` Spets! Spets! Spets! Spets!'' <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> rasped at a gathering of 1,000 workers, using Russian slang to criticize the network supplying special food, consumer goods, cars and drivers to <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials. His voice cracking from overuse, the former <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> boss of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> demanded the privileges be eliminated. `` All of them have to go,'' <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> said. The workers applauded. Days before Soviets vote in the first multicandidate elections, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> has become a lightning rod for people resentful of plenty for a privileged few and empty store shelves for the rest. The election is Sunday, and <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> is running against <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Brakov </PERSON>, director of the ZIL plant that manufactures the ultimate symbol of power and privilege: the shiny black ZIL limousine. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> received a warm welcome when he criticized official privileges at <PERSON> Brakov </PERSON>'s plant Tuesday in his drive to capture in a popular election a seat representing all of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The word `` spets'' is a short form of the Russian word for special, as in special privilege. <PERSON> Olga </PERSON> <PERSON> Ultiova </PERSON>, who joined a pro-Yeltsin demonstration in downtown <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Wednesday, praised him as the `` only one in 70 years of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> power who did not take the privileges offered by his position.'' <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> rallies, speeches and campaign posters are all over the Soviet capital. The campaigning is an unprecedented sign of political activity after years when Soviets dutifully went to the polls to mark their ballots for the only choice available, the candidate approved by party officials. The burly 58-year-old <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> native has become an issue himself. For or against, it is <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> who voters are discussing. `` For me, Comrade <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> is a real national hero,'' <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barinov </PERSON>, a disabled World War II veteran wrote to the <ORGANIZATION> Vechernaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moskva </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. But in a letter printed just above it, retiree <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pidevich </PERSON> wrote that a `` cult of personality'' already has begun to form around him. `` His personality is already covered by something that does n't correspond to reality, an unrealistic halo _ the basis of a cult. Those are charged words in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. For more than 30 years `` cult of personality'' is the term by which Soviets have referred to <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s reign of terror. It was <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s criticism of the party and warning that a cult was developing around President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> that got him fired as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party chief in November 1987. He charged into <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in late 1985 from the industrial city of <LOCATION> Sverdlovsk </LOCATION> as <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s choice to take over from the corrupt city administration of <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> Grishin </PERSON>. He won admirers for his energetic attacks on bureaucracy and food shortages, and was among the strongest supporters of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of `` glasnost,'' or greater openness. After his firing, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> went back to his original profession _ construction _ and was given a job as the first deputy chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. That job has the status of a government minister, but nowhere near the prestige. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> arrived at the ZIL plant in a black <LOCATION> Chaika </LOCATION> _ a limousine, but a step below the status of the factory's ZIL He admits to accepting special health services and a country home but says he turned down special food supplies, access to other special stores and services. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> is no more popular now with the party hierarchy than he was when he was accused of mistakes in his work as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party chief and being overly ambitious. But a <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> victory would be proof that under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> the party can tolerate diverse opinions. In an interview Thursday with the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> said authorities had been trying to restrict his access to the public during the campaign. Asked where the obstruction was coming from, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> said: `` First of all from the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> city authorities. But I think it has the agreement ... perhaps not the agreement, but at least the knowledge of the very top levels. `` It is clear that they do n't want me to get elected,'' <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> said. `` They get together and they say we're not going to let <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> through. I suppose it's because I ` m an awkward customer, they do n't know how to deal with me.'' The maverick Communist says he recognizes <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as the Soviet leader and does not intend to challenge him. `` From the viewpoint of the strategy of external politics, I fully support him,'' <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> said in February. `` From the viewpoint of the strategy of internal politics, fully. From the viewpoint of tactics, I have my own opinion.'' <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> says that is because the reforms have n't gone far enough. `` You may think this is a Utopia. I do n't consider it Utopia,'' he told the voters.

 <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents who arrested an ex-cabinet minister of <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> have warrants to arrest five other ex-aides to the ousted <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> leader, but are n't expecting them to visit, a federal agent said Thursday. A list prepared by <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> aides for security guards at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> showed that 11 former cabinet members were expected to visit the ailing <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, who has been hospitalized since Jan. 15 with heart and lung ailments. `` After what happened yesterday, we do n't have any information that they're still coming,'' said <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Girardi </PERSON>, assistant <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent-in-charge in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. `` We do n't have any absolute word that they're not, but we're really not expecting them anymore.'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> aides said the former ministers' trips may be canceled. The arrested aide, <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Laya </PERSON>, who was head of the <ORGANIZATION> Philippines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and later minister of education, was taken into custody on a material witness warrant Wednesday at <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. He was ordered to appear May 8 in U.S. District Court in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Girardi </PERSON> said material witness arrest warrants or subpoenas were also issued for at least five others, including five of the six former cabinet ministers scheduled to arrive in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> Thursday or Friday. Those who had been expected to visit <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> were C.E.A. <PERSON> Virata </PERSON>, former prime minister and finance minister; <ORGANIZATION> Manual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alba </ORGANIZATION>, former budget director; <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Azurin </PERSON>, former health minister, <PERSON> Placido </PERSON> <PERSON> Mapa </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, former secretary general; and <PERSON> Geronimo </PERSON> <PERSON> Velasco </PERSON>, former energy minister, <PERSON> Girardi </PERSON> said. The only scheduled guest who was not on the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s list was <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Pena </PERSON>, former director of Natural Resources, <PERSON> Girardi </PERSON> said. `` We may have just overlooked him,'' he said. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Gemmo </PERSON> <PERSON> Trinidad </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Rono </PERSON>, former minister of local governments, visited <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> Thursday, but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities did n't approach him. <PERSON> Rono </PERSON> came from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> said, and `` they probably did n't know he was coming so they did n't get him.'' `` Everyone who cleared their trip with -LRB- <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> was told ` sure, go ahead,' then when they get here they're greeted by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>,'' <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> said. `` It seems like there is an intimate cooperation between the two governments when Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has said her government would n't interfere in the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. matters.'' Meanwhile, former Philippine First Lady <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> called <PERSON> Laya </PERSON> `` a poor guy -LRB- who -RRB- does n't know anything about our business.'' `` This is really something to happen in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the land of democracy,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Honolulu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star-Bulletin </ORGANIZATION>. `` He was only coming here to pay his respects to a dying man. President <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' relationship with him was always very official. `` How very sad that a dying man can no longer have visitors,'' she said. <PERSON> Laya </PERSON> paid a $ 10,000 cash deposit on $ 100,000 bail Wednesday and was forced to surrender his passport. He was released pending a second bail hearing Friday to decide whether he can leave the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> before his scheduled <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> appearance. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> LaBella </PERSON>, lead prosecutor in the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> case, said <PERSON> Laya </PERSON> would not necessarily be held until May 8. `` He's important to the government's case and we want to make sure he's here to testify at the government's main case,'' <PERSON> LaBella </PERSON> said. `` It's calculated to make sure there's sufficient bail to ensure his appearance at trial.'' <PERSON> Laya </PERSON> was director of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' budget office in the mid-1970s and was later named <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> governor. He was forced to resign from the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in 1984 after the discovery of an overstatement of $ 600 million in the country's foreign exchange reserves. Despite criticism, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> then appointed <PERSON> Laya </PERSON> minister of education, a post he held until <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was ousted in 1986. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities said <PERSON> Laya </PERSON> earlier refused to talk to federal prosecutors in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, accused of stealing more than $ 100 million from his homeland and stashing much of it in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, remained in guarded condition Thursday at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francis </LOCATION>. Although Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> pleaded innocent to the charges and was freed on $ 5 million bail, her husband's ill health has prevented his arraignment. Four other visiting former aides _ <PERSON> Blas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ople </PERSON>, former minister of labor; <PERSON> Estelito </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendoza </PERSON>, former minster of justice; <PERSON> Conrado </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrella </PERSON>, former minister of agrarian reform; and <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Montes </PERSON>, former minister of social services _ have already received subpoenas and were ordered to appear in court with <PERSON> Layas </PERSON>.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> leader of a global ring that laundered drug-linked profits by claiming they were Israeli investments, at one point employing a Hasidic rabbi, was sentenced to 52 months in prison Thursday. Sentenced with ringleader <PERSON> Adi </PERSON> <PERSON> Tal </PERSON> was his chief lieutenant, <PERSON> Nir </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldeshtein </PERSON>, who received 40 months from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bissell </PERSON>. Each man pleaded guilty to conspiracy to launder money and two counts of specific currency violations. The 2 -LCB- - year investigation led to the indictment of 16 people last March in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> The government alleged $ 25 million was laundered during an 18-month period ending in March. The money in this case was shipped to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> or smuggled to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and wired to Panamanian bank accounts, officials said. In a memorandum released after <PERSON> Tal </PERSON>'s sentencing, the government provided more details about the money's origin. The government said Tal, a former airline worker who emigrated from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1983, worked with <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON>, allegedly a primary money-launderer for the Cali, a Colombian cocaine cartel that is one of the world's major exporters of the drug. According to the memorandum, Tal dealt repeatedly with <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON> over the telephone and directed money to be transferred to bank accounts controlled by <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON>. Tal's attorney, <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sellinger </PERSON>, said his client was recruited by a lifelong friend in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Korc </PERSON>, a fugitive in the case and <PERSON> Stroh </PERSON>'s nephew. He said <PERSON> Korc </PERSON> never told Tal the source of the money. The government has said it was tied to drugs. Tal and <PERSON> Goldeshtein </PERSON> were the last to be sentenced in the case. Both men, 28, had recently moved from the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> area to Edison before their arrest. Of the others indicted, nine have been sentenced. The wives of <LOCATION> Goldeshtein </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Tal </PERSON> entered a pre-trial diversion program and the rest are fugitives. One defendant, Rabbi <PERSON> Sholom </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitin </PERSON>, is the founder and head of <ORGANIZATION> Chabad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, a community center for the Lubavitch Hasidic sect. <PERSON> Levitin </PERSON> was sentenced to 30 days in a halfway house. Tal and <PERSON> Goldeshtein </PERSON> `` occasionally invested thousands of dollars at a time'' with <PERSON> Levitin </PERSON> in addition to his duties in the network, officials said. <PERSON> Levitin </PERSON> denied knowing the money he admitted laundering was ill-gotten. According to government papers, <PERSON> Tal </PERSON> told his mostly Israeli operatives that the money was unrelated to crime, <PERSON> Rabner </PERSON> said. Tal explained that the cash came from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for investment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or that it was somehow connected to the <LOCATION> Mossad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s secret service.

<TEXT>
 More than $ 18 million was mailed Thursday to 6,860 farmers in 10 states who settled a legal dispute with <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> over crop insurance applications rejected during the 1988 drought. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> lawyer who was appointed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> last fall to oversee the payments, said the farmers should be mailed the remaining 50 percent of their settlement payments by late April. <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> said he and his staff are still trying to resolve objections by about 930 farmers who oppose the $ 36.6 million settlement with <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Warren </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, and its insurance subsidiaries. Also still pending are processing problems with the cases of some other farmers, which remain to be worked out. The class-action case involves 7,484 farmers in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. The first payments cover 6,860 of the claims. The farmers sued after <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> began rejecting premiums and applications for insurance against crop damage as the drought worsened last year. <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> lawyers said the company was prepared to sell only about $ 40 million in coverage, but that its brokers sold more than $ 200 million. <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> and its insurance subsidiaries agreed in November to a settlement in which the company set aside a fund of $ 48.1 million to settle the farmers' claims. <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> said that not all of the fund may have to be used to pay the claims. <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and the farmers since have teamed to sue <ORGANIZATION> Good </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the agent that <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> alleges violated its contract with the company by selling more than the available number of crop insurance policies. <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> is to hear that lawsuit May 1. Good Weather has refused to comment on the case while it is under litigation.

 <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, newly freed from the charges that nearly led to his execution, arrived home Thursday to tears and hugs from family members and friends who had waited more than a decade for his release. `` You're supposed to have a resurrection around Easter,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' mother, <PERSON> Mildred </PERSON>, said shortly after embracing her son as he stepped off the plane at <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> `` I guess this is it.'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> arrived in his hometown just as the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, district attorney announced <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> would not be retried for the 1976 slaying of a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> policeman. Told of the news as he arrived, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> remained skeptical. `` I'll wait until I hear it from my attorney. I'm not supposed to talk about the case,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> told reporters. Later, he said, `` I've been standing in a twilight zone for the past 12 -LCB- years. ... I was in that twilight zone until the door opened. Thank God it did.'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> was convicted and sentenced to die in 1977 for the murder of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> police officer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, a crime to which another man has virtually confessed. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> was three days away from exection before his sentence was commuted in 1980 to life in prison. The case came under scrutiny in the documentary `` The Thin Blue Line,'' which questioned the testimony of the state's key witness, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>. Earlier this week, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> was released from prison in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> on grounds his first trial was unfair. As he arrived in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> embraced his mother first, and both broke into tears. <PERSON> Errol </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, director of `` The Thin Blue Line,'' had to battle a contingent of reporters and photographers to get close to <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>. He and <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> then embraced. About 100 supporters, many of them wearing yellow lapel ribbons, looked on. Among them was <PERSON> Tressa </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, a family friend. `` It feels great,'' Ms. <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> said. `` It's the best I've felt in 40 years, almost. His mother and I are real good friends, and we just stuck by each other. She's just really had a hard time. `` I told her all along that the Lord would have him released.'' Mayor <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Rinehart </PERSON> joined the merrymakers, offering a job to <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, who was unemployed before his arrest in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rinehart </PERSON> said he had no specific job in mind but would work that out with <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> told <PERSON> Rinehart </PERSON> jokingly, `` I did n't really want to be mayor.'' Asked if he expected such a reception, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said, `` I could n't have dreamed this I knew I would be home, but not this way.'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, who appeared red-faced and said he did not feel well after he got off the plane, was given an <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> cap and a lei made of daffodils. A few moments later, he held a news conference at the airport. As he walked from the terminal gate toward the area where the news conference was to be held, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' mother and his sister, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, stood on either side of him and appeared to be holding him up. He was taken to a private room in the airport and appeared fully recovered when he began speaking to reporters. While <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> was being reunited with his family here, District Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> announced in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> that a motion had been filed with state District Judge <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Baraka </PERSON> to dismiss the capital murder charge against <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in March set aside the conviction, saying <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> had n't gotten a fair trial because prosecutors suppressed evidence and witnesses lied on the stand.

 The Foreign Relations Department announced Wednesday it has no agreement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> allowing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> immigration officials to be based in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> recently posted teams of agents in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to monitor the routes of Central Americans passing through the country on their way to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, mostly to southern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The operation, which began Feb. 21 and has been canceled, came under criticism in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Mexican newspapers called it `` outrageous intrusion on Mexican sovereignty.'' The <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> was quoted as saying its patrols were carried out with the cooperation of the Mexican government. The Foreign Relations Department, in a dispatch sent to news agencies Wednesday afternoon, said, `` There is no diplomatic accord between <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that establishes the collaboration of the Mexican police and the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> to avoid the flow of undocumented immigrants to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> agents, traveling through <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, filed their daily reports to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, news reports said. The <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> has denied that the operation was undercover, but canceled it anyway. Central Americans have been emigrating to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in ever-increasing numbers, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say. Some officials estimate that 100,000 Central Americans will try to enter the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this year. On Feb. 21, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government clamped down on the flow of aliens asking for asylum in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by demanding proof of persecution. Since then, the overwhelming number of asylum cases in south <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> have been denied and the number of people seeking amnesty has dropped.

 An anti-crime group blew up a van Wednesday to dramatize the bombing of a vehicle driven by the wife of a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> captain, and authorities said the reenactment will be shown on local television to draw out witnesses. The videotaped bombing is part of the investigation into a March 10 blast that destroyed a van driven by <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, wife of USS Vincennes Capt. Will <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. A van similar to the one driven by Mrs. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> was taken to a deserted area near an airstrip and rigged for explosion and fire by Fire Department bomb experts. The reenactment is intended `` to trigger something in the mind of someone who may have seen something that day or in Mrs. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>' neighborhood leading up to the time of the bombing,'' said <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Cartmill </PERSON>, executive director of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> chapter of Crime Stoppers The national, non-profit organization, which staged the reenactment in cooperation with local and federal authorities, operates an anonymous tip hot line and raises reward money for those who help authorities solve crimes. On Tuesday, Mrs. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> was interviewed on videotape at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> police headquarters for the Crime Stoppers segment on the attack. The tape will be distributed to local television stations Monday. `` My understanding is she was an excellent speaker,'' said <PERSON> Cartmill </PERSON>. `` She did really well. She talks a lot about that morning, the explosion itself, and she makes a plea for information'' from the public. Mrs. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> escaped injury in the explosion, which occured when she was stopped at an intersection near the <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jolla </LOCATION> area of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. Authorities are investigating if the attack was terrorist retaliation for the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>' mistaken destruction of an Iranian jetliner in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> last July. All 290 aboard were killed. A total of $ 27,000 is being offered for information in the case: $ 25,000 from an anonymous <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> developer, $ 1,000 from Crime Stoppers and $ 1,000 from the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> crew. The videotape is being created with the cooperation of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, the lead agency in the investigation, as well as <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> and local authorities, <PERSON> Cartmill </PERSON> said. On Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Rogerses </ORGANIZATION> made their first public statement since the bombing, sending out a letter that calls on the nation to resist bowing to terrorism. `` The image of a burning van in the middle of a street of our community must not become a symbol of fear and unreasoned reaction,'' they said. Mrs. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> reportedly is resentful over the loss of her teaching job at La Jolla Country Day school following the bombing. Although the school has maintained that her leaving was a mutual decision, sources told the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> that Mrs. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> was fired after the possibility of terrorism was raised. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, the school's development director, said officials are standing by their earlier statement that Mrs. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>' and school officials decided she should leave her fourth-grade teaching position `` to ensure the safety of the children.'' <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> also said the school will pay Mrs. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> her full salary through August. He declined to say how much that is.

<HEAD>Oscar Ballot Comes Under Scrutiny As Some Allege Team Voting</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Oscar selection has come under scrutiny as film studios go to new lengths to pull votes out of the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>. And with the flood of <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> vote enticements _ from free coffee mugs to complimentary buffet dinners _ Academy members are acknowledging that some Oscar voting is done by committee, in violation of the rules. Secretaries, spouses and friends, several Academy members say, are marking ballots in what is supposed to be the entertainment industry's most esteemed awards competition. `` It's like a local election of judges,'' said Academy member <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Clein </PERSON>, who said he's witnessed team voting. `` A lot of people do n't know who the candidates are. So they take a look at who's around them and see what the consensus is `` As far as elections go, it's not bad. But I've never been through an election in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON>, who oversees the Oscar balloting for the accounting firm <ORGANIZATION> Price </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Waterhouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said that there is no guarantee that Academy members have actually filled out their own ballots. `` All we know is that a properly numbered ballot has been returned,'' he said. `` Members are on the honor system to fill out the ballot themselves.'' More than 4,600 members were given ballots this year for the 61st Annual Academy Awards, which will be telecast on March 29 from the <ORGANIZATION> Shrine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auditorium </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Academy members vote on their area of specialty. The Academy's actors branch, for example, is the only group to select nominees in the four acting categories. Since the voting is done secretly _ members do not sign their ballots _ the ballot's authenticity is ensured solely by a numeric control number, <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> said. Ballots are invalidated only if there is more than one vote in a given category, and only the votes in that specific category are not tallied, he said. Nominations for acting, directing, art direction and all specialized categories are handled by select branches and committees composed of Academy members. All voting members of the Academy can participate in the best picture nominations and may vote for the final awards in all categories. Winners for best documentary feature, best animated short film and best live-action short film are chosen by only those members who have seen all the nominees. Academy constituent <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Blaustein </PERSON> said that most of his colleagues take the voting very seriously. `` I do n't even vote -LRB- in a category -RRB- if I'm not familiar with the pictures in that category. ... And I've never told someone to vote for a film, even when I've done some of them. Meanwhile, other Oscar voting rules are perhaps being broken, speculates veteran Academy member <PERSON> Millard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON>. `` Although you're asked to vote in the nominations for five pictures, I think a lot of people figure out that they have a better chance if they just vote for their own picture and leave the other four blank,'' he said Given the tremendous impact both an Oscar nomination and an Oscar victory have on a film's fortunes, it's not entirely surprising that a certain degree of artifice might surround the Oscars. `` The Last Emperor'' took in $ 18.9 million, close to half the film's gross, after it won last year's best picture trophy. More than 70 percent of the revenues generated by 1986's best picture, `` Platoon,'' came after the film was nominated. On average, a best picture award is worth about $ 20 million these days. A $ 500,000 Oscar promotional campaign mounted by a studio, therefore, can be a good investment. In the case of this year's awards, a flurry of Academy-oriented newspaper advertisements, banquets, complimentary gifts and photo mailings tied to five late releases appears to have been remarkably successful This year, all best picture nominees and the large majority of top acting nominees came from movies released in December: `` The Accidental Tourist,'' `` Dangerous Liaisons,'' `` Rain Man'' and `` Working Girl'' were all released after Dec. 16. While these five movies might be good, the nearly complete exclusion of films from the rest of the year has highlighted the studios' mastery of Oscar marketing. `` I think the Academy Awards are crap,'' said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilliam </PERSON>, director of `` <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'' and the current `` The Adventures of <PERSON> Baron </PERSON> <PERSON> Munchausen </PERSON>.'' `` It's about selling films is all it's about,'' he said. `` It's one more way of flogging some films When ` <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>' got nominated -LRB- in 1986 -RRB-, they asked me to be a member of the Academy. And I would n't join I just do n't want to be a part of that at all.'' And at least one prominent Academy member, director <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Reiner </PERSON>, says that the manipulation of Oscar voters has reached new depths. <PERSON> Reiner </PERSON> said that <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION>' all-out effort to bag votes for <PERSON> Sigourney </PERSON> <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON>, a best actress nominee for `` Gorillas in the Mist,'' could lead him to vote against the film. `` I have in my house more color reproductions of <PERSON> Sigourney </PERSON> <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON> and a beautiful gorilla than I need,'' <PERSON> Reiner </PERSON> said of promotional material sent to his home. `` We've got to tell the Academy to stop this advertising. I'm getting turned off on the pictures I like.''

<HEAD>Retirement's Peace Shattered As Children Move Back In To Die</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN SEWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HUDSON, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Retirement's tranquility, seen by many as a reward after the responsibilities of child-rearing, is coming to a jarring end for a growing number whose children want to move back in _ and have AIDS. `` Some parents find out for the first time their child is gay and at the same time he also has AIDS. This is a real blow,'' said one 56-year-old woman whose son was diagnosed two years ago with AIDS. She asked that her name not be used because her son does n't want his identity known. `` Parents always think they should die first, before their children.'' `` And AIDS can split families,'' she added. `` Some members of the family accept, others reject him. That makes it worse for everybody. And you lose friends. Some churches even reject you.'' In addition, said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> of the Health Crisis Network in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, the $ 50,000 to $ 120,000 costs of care for AIDS patients `` put an extra burden on the parents, particularly if they are elderly and have limited finances.'' Increasingly, social workers and AIDS help network officials say, AIDS victims are coming to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Some come from the North because warm weather helps protect them from the pneumonia and flu they are susceptible to, others come from small states for better health care _ and others have parents here. `` My parents have been great,'' said a 41-year-old AIDS patient who moved from <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> five months ago. `` The clinic -LRB- in <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> -RRB- is really pretty good. Certainly, the weather is great.'' State officials have no firm data on AIDS migrants, but some clinics estimate that 10 percent to 15 percent of AIDS patients came to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> after being diagnosed. The number of reported cases, which officials said would not include some victims diagnosed elsewhere, has tripled since January 1987 to 6,856, putting <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> third behind <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` We do n't turn patients away,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Cobb </PERSON>, administrator of the state AIDS clinic in <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. `` But we ca n't be the front doorstep for the country. We do n't want to resemble the Statue of Liberty.'' As education about acquired immune deficiency syndrome has improved, and when relatives accept that the deadly virus is n't contracted by casual contact, instances of family rejection are decreasing, <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said `` Think about being at the terminal stage of your life and you have been rejected by the ones you feel close to, and you feel isolated from your relatives.'' `` The scariest thing for a young person is to be alone,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Meeker </PERSON>, who through <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> volunteer activities now works with the Pasco AIDS Support Community and cares for two AIDS victims as a volunteer. `` I found that gays are the first ones to turn and run when they find out you have AIDS,'' said a 26-year-old <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> man who was diagnosed in October and asked not to be identified to protect his lover. `` But my family has been very supportive. I'm glad they're there. In small towns like <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION>, 30 miles north of <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, news that someone is infected with AIDS spreads quickly and reaction can be quick. The <ORGANIZATION> Hernando-Pasco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospice </ORGANIZATION>, dedicated to helping terminal patients die with loving care at home, in October 1987 started a Pasco support group. Participants have painful memories: a son whose parents changed the locks; a youth whose brother-in-law told him to hurry up and die so he would n't burden the family; a woman whose boss made her get tested after he learned her son had AIDS, then transferred her from a cafeteria job despite a negative test result. The group has grown from four to at least 36 members and spawned two other groups in <LOCATION> Pasco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where 44 percent of the 260,000 residents are over 55. `` We have so many elderly people here, so many parents in one place, that we're seeing AIDS patients from other cities coming here to die with their parents,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Pavich </PERSON>, a support group member who has been diagnosed with human immune deficiency virus, HIV, which causes AIDS. <PERSON> Pavich </PERSON> said the group has helped him understand rejection by his family. `` It's really unfair. It's supposed to be their golden years, and everything's going great and then they're hit with this brick wall and everything changes.'' The hospice helped the 26-year-old <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> man, who feared he would die in a hospital in October as pneumonia worsened, his weight dropped to 95 pounds, and doctors refused to release him unless he could supply his oxygen, medicine and other needs. He's now up to 145 pounds and talks with determined optimism. `` I try not to think about it. I know eventually it's going to happen, but I live day to day and try to make every day the best possible,'' he said. In this county, which is typical of rural counties being discovered by developers, a relatively small influx of AIDS victims quickly strains services. `` There are so many things we need in this area. We need food, medical attention, outpatient care, dental treatment,'' said <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON>, a hospice services coordinator who recently called seven dentists before finding one who would care for an AIDS patient. `` We get frustrated; we get angry. What we need is more information and more education.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> is trying to win the friendship of the former <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> colonies where it fought bitter wars just 15 years ago. Prime Minister <PERSON> Anibal </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavaco </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>'s recent visit to <LOCATION> Guinea-Bissau </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>'s former West African colony where the fight for independence was the fiercest, was the latest in a series of journeys that included the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> island nations of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tome </LOCATION> e Principe and is likely to continue with <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> in southeast <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> later this year. A package of nine accords signed in <LOCATION> Bissau </LOCATION>, including an agreement to create the framework of an escudo zone, is seen as an effort to regain influence in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and improve <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>'s diplomatic standing worldwide The escudo is <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>'s currency. A string of left-leaning governments that followed the <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> military coup April 25, 1974, never seemed able to get close to the then-Marxist revolutionary governments in the five <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> countries where Portuguese is still the official language. The five nations _ known by the <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> acronym PALOPS, for Portuguese-Speaking African Countries _ are <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guinea-Bissau </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> and Sao Tome e Principe. They embarked on a Marxist-inspired path of development via industrialization and centralized economies after gaining independence in the mid-1970s. According to <PERSON> Adelino </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON>, lecturer on <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Higher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION>, `` it was always a question of values'' with <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>'s socialist governments `` If -LRB- African -RRB- governments were n't democratic enough, there was no deal. It was an obstacle to cooperation.'' <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> said <PERSON> Cavaco </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>, a center-right Social Democrat <PERSON> Cavaco </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>, `` puts business first.'' `` The reinforcement of our relations with the PALOPS is a priority of this government,'' says <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Durao </PERSON> <PERSON> Barroso </PERSON>, secretary of state for foreign affairs and cooperation, who is regarded as the driving force behind <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>'s African policy. Since the Social Democrats under <PERSON> Cavaco </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> won <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>'s first absolute parliamentary majority in July 1987, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> has signed 78 cooperation accords with its former African colonies In the beginning these involved agreements on sports, education, farming and health, but recent agreements include military accords with all PALOPS countries except <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, which remains locked in civil war. Nevertheless, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> will become the first Western nation to have a military attache in <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s capital, following a recent exchange agreement. The decision to guarantee the convertibility of <LOCATION> Guinea-Bissau </LOCATION>'s peso currency by linking it to <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>'s escudo, was a `` major, qualitative step in cooperation,'' <PERSON> Durao </PERSON> <PERSON> Barroso </PERSON> said Sao Tome and <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION> are likely to be interested in a similar accord. <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s membership in an escudo zone is expected to be discussed before the end of the year. Up to now, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>'s drive for closer links with the Africans has concentrated mostly on the three smallest countries. Because Cape Verde, <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tome </LOCATION> e Principe and <LOCATION> Guinea-Bissau </LOCATION> lack the size and potential wealth of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, they have retained close trading links with <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>. The view in <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION> is that increased influence in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> would lend <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> greater political weight in the international arena. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Deus </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinheiro </PERSON> has been drumming up international support for a projected $ 600 million-economic assistance plan for <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, once fighting ends between the Marxist government in <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION> and U.S.-backed rebels of <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> has pledged $ 50 million toward the rehabilitation of the strategic east-west <LOCATION> Benguela </LOCATION> railway that before independence provided a vital route for exports from nearby <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>. But competition for influence in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, potentially one of sub-Saharan <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s richest nations, is growing. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, itself a former <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> territory, has already granted <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION> a $ 1.2 billion-credit to be repaid in Angolan oil. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and other <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> nations are looking to increase trade with <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, a country <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> regarded as the jewel in its colonial crown. As the poorest member of the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> can not compete on economic terms with its European neighbors. But <PERSON> Durao </PERSON> <PERSON> Barroso </PERSON> says the Portuguese should cash in on a competitive advantage of experience and adaptability. `` The Portuguese have a good understanding of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and Africans ... and we cost less,'' he said. `` It's usually cheaper to employ a <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> teacher, say, than one from a richer country.''

 Amid the rock'em, sock'em yocks of Saturday night, viewers will soon have a saner alternative when a kinder kind of talk-show host, <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Wholey </PERSON>, returns to <ORGANIZATION> PBS </ORGANIZATION> with `` LateNight <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' `` I guess you could say we're going to be the Saturday alternative to wrestling and the Church Lady,'' <PERSON> Wholey </PERSON> said, referring to the popular character on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Saturday Night Live.'' <PERSON> Wholey </PERSON>'s two-hour weekly talk show will feature in-studio guests _ newsmakers, authors and celebrities _ responding to telephone queries and comments. It premieres Saturday on about 100 public television stations nationwide. <PERSON> Wholey </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> radio talk-show host, was host of the critically praised `` LateNight <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' on <ORGANIZATION> PBS </ORGANIZATION> from 1982 until he ended the run in 1985. `` I made a decision to leave, because I wanted to take a look at my own background,'' he said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, where the show will originate. `` I grew up in an alcoholic home, and as a recovering alcoholic myself, I just wanted to get out of the public eye.'' <PERSON> Wholey </PERSON> went through private therapy, started some Adult Children of Alcoholics groups and wrote books: `` The Courage of Change: Personal Conversations About Alcoholism,'' `` Are You Happy?'' and the most recent `` Becoming Your Own Parent: The Solution for Adult Children of Alcoholics.'' After all that, he said, `` I felt very good, and all of a sudden it came time to go back on the air again.'' Part of the talk show will revolve around self-help issues, but mostly it will be a discussion of an eclectic collection of subjects _ for instance, upcoming topics include gun control and the Academy Awards. Viewers who flee the confrontational styles of many current talk shows can relax with <PERSON> Wholey </PERSON>. `` I think that people trust me,'' he said. `` I do n't think that television is church. I make mistakes. I probably mispronounce words. I'm up there, I'm one of them, and I think the audience perceives that I'm part of who they are.''

 In <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s new `` Men,'' four high-school buddies, a surgeon, a lawyer, a newspaper columnist and a cop, now in their 30s, still meet weekly over poker to crack wise. Just like a million guys in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Despite the unlikely premise, `` Men,'' set in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> and filmed in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, comes darn close to succeeding, thanks mainly to the fine cast: <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Wass </PERSON> -LRB- `` Soap'' -RRB-, <PERSON> Saul </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubinek </PERSON>, Ving Rhames and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>. It premieres Saturday. The look of the show, directed by <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Werner </PERSON>, will contribute to the already unavoidable comparison to `` thirtysomething.'' `` Men'' is n't `` thirtysomething,'' even though it is about 30-ish folks who spend a lot of time trying to figure out why they're not happy. It's not nearly as well-written. <PERSON> Rubinek </PERSON>, the only Canadian among the regulars, plays <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, a columnist for the <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> who rhapsodizes about his ex-wife, before finding out she plans not to get back with him but to marry an investment banker who saves <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s ego by turning out to be bald. <PERSON> Wass </PERSON> is surgeon <PERSON> Steven </PERSON>, who spends most of his time picking up new women, then finding something wrong with them and dumping them before things get serious. Rhames is lawyer <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON>, the black member of group and its resident, well-adjusted family man. <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> is <PERSON> Danny </PERSON>, a quick-tempered young cop, whose older brother <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>, also a cop, was a founding member of the group. In the pilot, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> is killed chasing down a purse-snatcher in an incongruously violent sequence. His death prompts soul-searching among the others. Too often the pilot wanders into sentimentality when it is n't being awfully convenient. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> is the surgeon who operates on <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>. What are there, four people in all of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>? <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> works at a newspaper, but does n't seem to write anything Would <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Breslin </PERSON> not write about the death of a cop who was one of his best friends? After <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>'s funeral, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> goes off to the old high-school football field. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> shows up there, too, just by chance. The two run across the field reliving that touchdown run that won the big game. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> chides that the game-winner occurred `` only once.'' `` Once was immortal,'' declares <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>. `` Once gives me bragging rights forever.'' So it's been lifted from innumerable buddy movies. It's still a nice scene. By the end of the episode, <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> has won his place in the group and we're back at the poker table. `` Men'' is worth dealing in, at least for a few hands.

<HEAD>PBS Series Looks At U.S. Education</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE MITGANG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The first of a five-part public TV series on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> education is called `` The Education Race'' _ an unfortunate title for an otherwise superb, eye-opening program. Learning these days is too often spoken of as a race rather than a lifelong habit. Current fashion has it that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> children are in some sort of global education contest from birth. And they are `` losing'' this race to the Japanese, the Koreans and just about everyone else. This perception seems more curmudgeonly than constructive. If we're losing economic ground to the Japanese, it's a bit heartless to put that failure on the shoulders of kindergartners. Fortunately, despite its title, the first hour of the PBS series, `` Learning in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' sidesteps that trap. The series, premiering tonight and airing weekly, is the product of more than 1,000 interviews in 21 states, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> _ and all that reporting shows. The first part, narrated by <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Mudd </PERSON>, is extraordinary television for its depth and sophistication. The PBS correspondents behind the series, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Solman </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Merrow </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charlayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter-Gault </PERSON>, include the right balance of experts to paint an incisive and sobering view of American classrooms. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kearns </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, says schools need complete restructuring if they are to produce tomorrow's workers. <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozol </PERSON>, an authority on illiteracy, says the biggest corporate `` gift'' a company could give a school would be for executives to send their children to the local public school, not private academies. A generation ago, <PERSON> Mudd </PERSON> says, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> asked, can <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> read? Now it's, `` Can <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> think? Can <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> compute?'' He takes us to classrooms in a high school in <LOCATION> Fremont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and one in <LOCATION> Yokohama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, students go through `` exam hell'' to see who goes on to college and career success. They spend 240 days a year in school. Americans spend 180. But, we learn Japanese youngsters rarely feel neglected or alienated. There is no time and little inclination for sex or drugs. Their parents sacrifice. They expect hard work from their children, but they do n't saddle them with household chores or afterschool jobs. In such a small country, parents ca n't leave a legacy of land to their children. Learning is the birthright. And they do indeed learn. It could n't be more different in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Teens are said to display a `` cool indifference'' to hard work. Parents see themselves as busy surviving, so schools wind up with much of the parenting role. Non-college-bound Japanese youngsters go to vocational schools, like many Americans. But in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> they learn on sophisticated, high-tech equipment and have a full load of academic courses. Nearly all get jobs eventually. In <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, vocational students learn to repair cars. Instead of academics, they get Mickey-Mouse courses in cooking or how to balance checkbooks. Many wind up in junior college where they learn what they should have mastered in high school. This failure to educate amounts to a `` hidden tax'' on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry, which winds up spending thousands of dollars educating workers in basic skills. In a particularly informative sequence, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> youngsters display their dismaying ignorance of the skills needed to succeed in the job market. Students think they can always get a `` factory job'' no matter how little they know. The reality is that even entry-level jobs now require computer and thinking skills. The program reveals that some 350 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies have set up operations in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> where an eager and educated workforce is more than happy to settle into jobs that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> youngsters are thumbing their noses at. <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> sends health claim forms to <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> to be processed by workers who are not afraid of work, and who have the math skills that many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> high school graduates lack. Finally, the program takes a look at <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, perhaps the closest thing <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has to an educational miracle. The state passed a sweeping education reform package in 1984 that has helped raise test scores and lure whites back to public schools. The program correctly indicates that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> is a national model for bringing business into partnership with schools. It omits, however, the more questionable features of that state's reform efforts, particularly the incredible volume of state-mandated tests heaped on students. Such nits aside, this first hour of `` Learning in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' augurs well for the remaining four: `` Upstairs-Downstairs,'' private vs. public schools; `` Teach Your Children,'' concern about curricula; `` Wanted: A Million Teachers,'' getting and keeping good teachers; `` Paying the Freight,'' the future _ and cost _ of education in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>No Tax Increase? Why It's Unnatural</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 No tax increase? Why that's like saying the sun wo n't set or the tide wo n't rise or that your pay stub next year wo n't read any differently than it does right now. It's against nature, in this instance human or political, no matter what the promise was by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The president may not be reneging, but there will indeed be a tax increase this year, amounting to nearly $ 147 billion. Anyone checking out a pay stub already is aware of some of that increase, because an additional $ 36.1 billion income tax bill and billions more in Social Security tax increases went into effect automatically with the new year. The riddle has a simple if painful explanation: Since the big tax cut in 1981, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has enacted 13 separate tax bills. The additions to the tax load began in the very next year and continued right through 1988. Provisions in those bills kick in automatically. That is, says the <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, which supplied these numbers, taxes grow without any new tax action, the reason being that `` increases are already here.'' The situation has many lessons, among them: _ When it comes to taxes, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> can dictate policy for a president who, at the time, had n't even announced his candidacy _ <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> giveth and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> taketh away It giveth dramatically, it taketh quickly and, when possible, quietly. For example, the biggest tax increase of the 1980s, the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act, was passed in 1982, one year after the biggest tax cut of the 1980s, the Economic Recovery Tax Act in 1981. _ <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> tax policy is inconsistent, changing every year But the biggest, most important and most painful lesson is that there seems to be no way of avoiding tax increases, even when the most powerful political figure in the nation gives his promise. The Washington-based research foundation, whose non-profit and non-partisan designation confers certain tax-exemptions, calculates that <ORGANIZATION> TEFRA </ORGANIZATION> _ the 1982 tax increase _ will by itself raise taxes $ 55.7 billion this year. Moving right along, the 1984 Deficit Reduction Act -LRB- DEFRA -RRB- likely will raise another $ 27.7 billion more this year than last, $ 16 billion of it through individual income taxes and the rest from corporations. The Revenue Act of 1987, enacted in an effort to avoid any election-year tax manipulation, managed to do something of that very sort. Last year it yielded $ 8.6 billion; this year, it will cost taxpayers about $ 14 billion. Unlike income tax increases, which are broadly based, some increases scheduled for this year affect only certain groups. The Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act, passed last July 1, will impact senior citizens mainly, especially those in higher-income brackets. Says the foundation: `` The estimated -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> MCCA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- revenue increase for 1989 is only $ 600 million; but after 1989 the revenue take will average around $ 7 billion a year, just from the elderly.'' In other words, while the impact of that measure will be felt mildly this year it will provoke cries of pain thereafter. It is the kind of reaction that might make <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> consider still another version of tax policy. End Adv PMs Friday, March 24

<TEXT>
 A few feet from the spot where a young <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON> once performed for an indifferent audience, <PERSON> Lena </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> makes her bed. In the same room where <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> McLean </PERSON> played while his `` American Pie'' was climbing the charts, <PERSON> Lena </PERSON>'s 14-year-old white Persian cat, <PERSON> Sasha </PERSON>, pads across the wooden floor worn smooth by the tapping feet of a generation of folk music fans. This is <PERSON> Caffe </PERSON> <PERSON> Lena </PERSON>, regarded as the nation's oldest continually run coffeehouse. It is the place where <PERSON> Lena </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> has made her livelihood for 29 years and her home for the past two. Here, one floor above a French bistro, a vacant violin shop and <PERSON> Hattie </PERSON>'s Chicken Shack, 20 small tables and 80 chairs fill an L-shaped, brick-walled room. A small stage, microphone stand and an upright piano take up most of one corner. <PERSON> Lena </PERSON> has been forced out of her last three apartments by new landlords intent on renovations and higher rents. `` I finally said, ` What the heck,' and set up a room in the back.'' Failing eyesight and heart ailments have slowed her over the years, and her friends fret over the fact that she lives alone with only <PERSON> Sasha </PERSON> for company. But <PERSON> Lena </PERSON>, who turned 66 on Jan. 4, feels an attachment to the <LOCATION> Caffe </LOCATION> that most people reserve for old friends. `` The Caffe is my whole existence, the be-all and end-all of my life,'' she said. `` My life began almost in 1960.'' <PERSON> Caffe </PERSON> <PERSON> Lena </PERSON> has seen such folk stars as <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON>, <PERSON> McLean </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Seeger </PERSON>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bromberg </PERSON>, <PERSON> Loudon </PERSON> <PERSON> Wainwright </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, <PERSON> Arlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON> and Ramblin' <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliot </PERSON>, sidekick of the late <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON>, <PERSON> Arlo </PERSON>'s father Veterans of the folk circuit, such as <PERSON> U. </PERSON> <PERSON> Utah </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Paxton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Ronk </PERSON>, return year after year, drawn by <PERSON> Caffe </PERSON> <PERSON> Lena </PERSON>'s informal setting, appreciative audiences and <PERSON> Lena </PERSON>'s own indomitable spirit. Others, such as <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Rush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Danko </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapin </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> play <PERSON> Lena </PERSON>'s to boost solo careers. And then there are the young musicians, the ones who saw the folk venues dwindling but found an audience at <PERSON> Lena </PERSON>'s: The <PERSON> Roches </PERSON>, Aztec Twostep, <PERSON> Rory </PERSON> <PERSON> Block </PERSON>, <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Lavin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Bird </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> bluesmen, gospel singers, jazz players, actors, playwrights and poets have all found an outlet at <LOCATION> Caffe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lena </LOCATION>, where they do n't have to compete with televisions or video games. And <PERSON> Lena </PERSON> has never had a liquor license. Coffee, tea and baked goods are served, along with the music, for a cover charge of $ 5 to $ 15. Running <PERSON> Caffe </PERSON> <PERSON> Lena </PERSON> has not been easy. <PERSON> Lena </PERSON>, as she likes to be called, still takes reservations over the phone herself, books all acts, does her own publicity work and deals with bills and creditors. Though a tight group of friends and supporters distributes her posters around town, serves as waitresses and cooks on performance nights and works the lights and the sound system, the tough times get more difficult as the years progress. `` I get through those periods,'' <PERSON> Lena </PERSON> said. `` I just grit my teeth and say, ` Damn it, I'm going to continue.''' And she puts everything she has into the coffeehouse. Keeping <PERSON> Caffe </PERSON> <PERSON> Lena </PERSON> open has meant many sacrifices, including her marriage. Her husband, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON>, left her in the early'60s when he wanted to move on and she did n't. She does n't own a car and depends on taxis and friends for transportation. Money is tight. A $ 32 residual check for a bit part in the movie `` Ironweed'' seems like a windfall. Part of the blame for her situation lies with <PERSON> Lena </PERSON>. Since its first day, her coffeehouse has primarily served as a place where young musicians come to develop their skills. `` She insists that young people have a forum, a stage on which to build an audience,'' says <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> McKenney </PERSON>, a folk music festival coordinator. `` It's a brave _ some say foolish _ policy, but a good one.'' Many of the regular performers at <PERSON> Lena </PERSON>'s are musicians who have been coming back for 10 or 20 years or more. They eventually become part of her family. Folksinger <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Alarik </PERSON> remembers <PERSON> Lena </PERSON>'s apartments always being filled with `` stray cats and folksingers. `` And she always insists on paying people as much as she can, which for <PERSON> Lena </PERSON> means more than she should,'' he said. <PERSON> Caffe </PERSON> <PERSON> Lena </PERSON> was once the favorite haunt of students at <ORGANIZATION> Skidmore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, a liberal arts school formerly located up the street from the coffeehouse. The college's relocation to the outskirts of town in the early'70s was followed by a decline in folk's popularity, and <PERSON> Caffe </PERSON> <PERSON> Lena </PERSON> suffered. `` The really good years were the'60s and early'70s,'' <PERSON> Lena </PERSON> said. `` People would come to the Caffe no matter who was performing. They could trust my judgment.'' But the students, perhaps inspired by the music of such new folk artists as <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, are returning. The Caffe is attracting more and more students who are too young to get into <PERSON> Saratoga </PERSON>'s bars And <PERSON> Lena </PERSON>'s still holds a special place on the folk circuit. `` People still want to play <PERSON> Lena </PERSON>'s,'' said <PERSON> Alarik </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> musician who first performed at the coffeehouse a decade ago. `` It's still as good as it gets for folk music For getting right up close and friendly, I do n't think it gets any better than <PERSON> Lena </PERSON>'s.'' <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Ronk </PERSON> has been playing <PERSON> Lena </PERSON>'s since the beginning. `` At that point I do n't think anyone envisioned themselves going on for 29 years,'' he said. It was a call from <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Ronk </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Terri </PERSON> <PERSON> Thal </PERSON>, to <PERSON> Lena </PERSON> that got <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON> a gig in <LOCATION> Saratoga </LOCATION>, one of the few coffeehouses he in which he performed before going on to concerts. But when <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON> took the stage at <ORGANIZATION> Caffe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lena </ORGANIZATION>, the audience was more interested in their own conversations than the music. `` Nobody would listen to him,'' <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Ronk </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> climbed up on the stage and balled the audience out. He said, ` There's something important going on here.' <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> said it did n't work Everyone kept on talking. He was quite upset.'' <PERSON> Lena </PERSON> had a backstage pass for <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON>'s concert last summer at Saratoga Performing Arts Center. She said they chatted and <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON>, like he had 28 years before, fretted about that night's performance. If anything, she's realistic about her place in his career. `` I do n't credit myself with discovering any talent,'' <PERSON> Lena </PERSON> said. `` I credit myself with providing a place to perform early in a career. `` I guess I've been doing the right thing. I'm still here.''

<HEAD>England's Second City Celebrates a Birthday and Economic Recovery</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Now <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s second largest city, <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> has been around for at least 900 years, but this year it is celebrating a centennial and a new beginning. It is marking its recovery from a severe recession and hopes people will forget what they thought about it before and take note of what's good about it now. It was in 1889 that <PERSON> Queen </PERSON> <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON>, who had her own misgivings about the place, granted <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> its city charter. That's the reason for the centennial. But it is using the occasion to bury a recession that wiped out more than 200,000 jobs and ravaged its traditional metals industry. The city of 1.05 million, 100 miles northwest of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, is hoping the year-long celebration, with more than 600 individual events, also will clear away its image as a cultural wasteland and sterile, concrete jungle. Birmingham-bashing is as old as the city itself. History books tell of <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> drawing the shades of her royal carriage to block out its industrial soot, gloom and grime when she came here on her travels through the English midlands. In her 1816 novel `` Emma'' <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Austen </PERSON> wrote: `` One has no great hopes for <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>. I always say there is something direful in the sound.'' `` Manufacturing used to be a very dirty industry,'' explained <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Fretter </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION>'s principal marketing officer. `` It's not anymore. People have n't yet adjusted to that new situation.'' <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> has been a trading center for centuries, although the Domesday Book of 1086 rated it one of the poorest in <LOCATION> Warwickshire </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. It prospered during the 16th century as a finishing center and marketing outlet for basic metal goods from the surrounding area and is acknowledged to have been the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution long before it became a city. As <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s workshop, <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> attracted a rich diversity of immigrants, primarily from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s farflung Empire, until the recession struck in 1979. `` It hit hard,'' <ORGANIZATION> Fretter </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Vast swathes in the city of <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> were left totally derelict.'' `` The shakeout of the <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> economy was catastrophic, to say the least,'' said <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bore </PERSON>, chairman of the economic development committee of the Labor Party-controlled <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>'s recovery was spurred by the council's sponsorship of several megaprojects, including a modern science park and the $ 215-million <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> scheduled to open in 1991. It also spent the equivalent of $ 2.5 million on a bid to be the host of the 1992 Summer Olympics. The bid failed _ <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> won out _ but it signified the new confidence of a city that only two years ago came dead last in a survey of the quality of life in 38 British cities. Besides its traditional prides and joys _ more canals than <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s largest public library, a rating as having the best tap water of any big city in the world, even if it is piped from <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> _ <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> is scheduling $ 2.5 billion for development. Manufacturing production has outstripped the previous record set in 1979, 80 percent of manufacturers are working at more than 90 percent capacity and unemployment has fallen to 7.5 percent from 1982's peak of 16.8 percent. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> set up his automobile works in the city's <LOCATION> Longbridge </LOCATION> district in 1905 and pioneered the popular Austin 7 Today, <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> holds <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s only street-circuit car race, the annual Super Prix, and the auto industry is once again the city's largest employer, home to the <ORGANIZATION> Rover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>'s modern robotic car plant and the <ORGANIZATION> Austin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> division of the British <ORGANIZATION> Leyland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Business travel to the city, streamlined by a modern international airport, has helped create 73,000 jobs and has made <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> the fifth most visited city in Visitors spent the equivalent of $ 635 million here in 1987. `` Brummies,'' as <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>'s residents are known, concede they now must pay attention to how their city looks, as well as how it works. In the 1960s, most of the city's Victorian heart was torn out and replaced by featureless concrete and mirror glass buildings, surrounded _ some say strangled _ by a beltway. It's architectural style is still symbolized by two of its best known landmarks _ the <ORGANIZATION> Bull </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ring </ORGANIZATION>, a covered shopping complex soon to be replaced by a $ 688-million continental style arcade, and Spaghetti Junction, a vast criss-crossing of roads, cloverleafs and overpasses. The planners `` ripped the city apart in the'50s and'60s,'' <PERSON> Bore </PERSON> said. `` The drive to clear the slums and to provide for the age of the motor car lacked the sensitivity the planning community now has.'' The city has an eclectic mixture of performing arts: UB40, the acclaimed multiracial rock group, comes from <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>; `` Spitting Images,'' the wickedly satirical puppet show is produced here, and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Rattle </PERSON>, the wunderkind of British conductors, has led the <ORGANIZATION> Birmingham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION> since he was 25 years old. In a recent coup, the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> lured the <PERSON> Sadler </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ballet </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> with a $ 10.3-million financing offer. The traveling section of the Royal Ballet will move into the 1,950-seat Hippodrome in August 1990.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Nahid </PERSON> <PERSON> Samir </PERSON> went to college and earned an engineering degree. Today, she's a housekeeper-nanny. <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> studied business administration at <ORGANIZATION> Cairo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. He drives a taxi. They're lucky; they have jobs. Other college graduates _ roughly a million by one official estimate _ ca n't find any work at all, a situation that is potentially explosive. Egyptian universities turn out 100,000 graduates a year. Many find their dreams brutally shattered by a twin headaches in this overpopulated country of 54 million: unemployment and underemployment. Official estimates put <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s jobless rate at around 10 percent. But another 10 percent are in `` jobs'' supplied to graduates under a 30-year-old government policy that pays almost nothing in wages but requires little more of the job-holder than signing a work register. `` It is a high percentage without doubt,'' said <PERSON> Mokhtar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Hamid </PERSON> of the governing <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, head of the labor committee in the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, the national parliament. `` We are a developing nation and need the efforts of every person. This high percentage can affect development.'' For the first time, President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s government is ringing the alarm bell and testing a variety of remedies. `` We do not need more people,'' <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> said in a recent speech. `` What we need is better planning and development of the educational system, and connecting it to the needs of development. `` We hope the government will be able to open new fields for -LRB- graduates -RRB- so we can destroy this unemployment phenomenon.'' Proposed solutions include small-business loans for graduates or selling them cheap desert land for agricultural reclamation. Opening retraining centers also has been suggested, in hopes of turning unemployed graduates into skilled tradesmen, who are much in demand. The employment problem is the result of several factors. Very important is the mushrooming population, increasing by a million every nine months. Also, the world oil glut that hit the economies of the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> countries brought home to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s labor pool hundreds of thousands of Egyptians whose jobs abroad had disappeared. Part of the problem lies with two policies left over from <PERSON> Gamal </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON>'s socialist <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> of the 1950s and 1960s: free higher education, which has created a surplus of university graduates and a shortage of skilled laborers, and the promise of a job to any graduate who ca n't find one in private business. By January 1989, the government was looking to find jobs for people who graduated in June 1983. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s economy is stagnant, encumbered by a $ 44-billion foreign debt and high inflation. The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> has been discussing unemployment and <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> himself is meeting with senior politicians in search of a solution. `` Lots of things combined and led to this unemployment problem,'' the assembly's <PERSON> Abdel-Hamid </PERSON> said. He enumerated the main ones as population growth, the large number of graduates, the lack of money for building new factories to create jobs and the return of the workers from the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> oil fields. `` There has to be a study to know what the Egyptian market needs, and then -LRB- we should -RRB- set education policies accordingly,'' <PERSON> Abdel-Hamid </PERSON> said. `` There also has to be more work on institutes or junior colleges to teach certain skills that are needed like carpentry and plumbing.'' The Engineers' Union says 20,000 new engineers are looking for jobs. Fewer new doctors than that are out of work, but a physician's starting salary in a government hospital is 60 pounds -LRB- $ 25 -RRB- a month And with the present rate of population growth, 6 million new job-seekers will enter the market in the next decade.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 American education is laid bare in a landmark television series virtually certain to leave viewers unsettled and embarrassed. `` Learning In <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' starting Monday night on <ORGANIZATION> PBS </ORGANIZATION>, is a five-part, multimillion dollar look at what's happening in the nation's classrooms, featuring <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Mudd </PERSON> and three correspondents from the MacNeil-Lehrer Newshour. The portrait is always revealing, sometimes chilling. `` I do n't want to graduate, to tell you the truth. It's just fun. I like it,'' says a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> high school senior interested mainly in sports. `` I think it's my senior year and I'm going to relax,'' says his friend, explaining why he's taking nutrition and lifestyle courses instead of the math he needs to become a computer repairman. And from <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> high school teacher <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagel </PERSON>: `` This is a job that breaks your heart every day.'' The makers of `` Learning in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' roved from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION>, from <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, to paint a broad television canvas unusual in the far-flung, locally controlled education field. `` The reason education does n't get covered well on TV is that it's so decentralized. Finding out about what's going on is very time-consuming,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinlan </PERSON>, executive producer of the series. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> put up nearly $ 4 million for the series, equally divided between production and promotion, and had nothing to do with content. A number of other companies were also interested in financing the project, <PERSON> Quinlan </PERSON> said. `` That's one indicator of the anxiety levels of American business,'' he said. `` American business is in shock right now'' about the state of the education system. A shocker in the first section of the series is the revelation that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Life </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Freehold </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> is shipping thousands of medical claims to a rural Irish town to be processed. A personnel officer of the company said she ca n't find enough competent, motivated high school graduates close to home to fill her workforce. <PERSON> Mudd </PERSON>, who taught for a year at a private boys school before going into journalism, said in an interview that the two students drifting through high school `` are probably generally typical of that big group of kids between the gifted and the slow. The top and the bottom get all the attention. It's the middle group that's worrisome. <PERSON> Mudd </PERSON> noted the boys' plans to attend a free, open-admissions junior college and remarked: `` In one year they'll try to learn the stuff they did n't learn because they'd been playing for four years, and of course the taxpayers will have to foot that bill.'' In fairness to the boys, the series notes that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> schools do n't have clear goals and expectations for middle-range students This is contrasted with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, where all students are expected to be serious, disciplined and solidly prepared for their futures. Another key point is that Japanese parents are totally involved in their children's education, while <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> parents are more likely to be locked in a consuming struggle for economic survival. `` The main thing I noticed -LRB- in making the series -RRB- was how fast the American family has changed and how far we all are behind in responding to that, not just the schools but the whole society,'' <PERSON> Quinlan </PERSON> said. He cited women in the workplace, divorce rates and single-parent families, latch-key kids and students working 30 hours a week after school. `` It really hit home _ we're not in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> anymore, Toto,'' <PERSON> Quinlan </PERSON> said. The most disturbing parts of the series examine inequities in American schools and problems in the teaching profession. <PERSON> Nagel </PERSON> is shown trying to call her gynecologist from a public phone; a 23-year veteran does n't have his own classroom; an incompetent teacher is fired and then hired within hours by another principal who never bothered to call for a reference. <PERSON> Mudd </PERSON> said he came away from the series `` agitated but not depressed, because enough places are in fact doing something and doing it well.'' But correspondent <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Merrow </PERSON>, a former teacher who holds a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> Ph.D. in education, said the successful formulas at such schools most often are ignored elsewhere. `` All these terrific things that happen, they are not copied,'' <PERSON> Merrow </PERSON> said in an interview. `` There are some very hopeful signs. The question is, is progress being made at a fast enough rate to keep us from going into the dumpster?''

 Maybe it's the immaculate rows of discounted shampoo and paper towels, or the doorside hand-pumping `` people greeters'' who make visitors feel like they've entered a sprawling mom-and-pop corner store. If the 97,000-square foot <ORGANIZATION> Waxahachie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> is any indication of the discount chain's operations in 26 states, it's not hard to see why <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has staked a claim as the country's dominant retailer, pleasing customers and sending nervous ripples into the boardrooms of competitors `` As for <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> becoming a household word, we never think about things like that,'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Glass </PERSON>, president and chief operating officer, said in a telephone interview from company headquarters in <LOCATION> Bentonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark </LOCATION>. `` What we want is for customers in our territories to think of us fondly.'' Local shopkeepers as well as giants like <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> are watching Wal-Marts spurt like weeds and wondering whether some of their business could be choked by a rival that religiously pursues its corporate strategy with the fervor of a rural evangelist. <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> took root when <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> and his brother <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> founded the first <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Discount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rogers </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark </LOCATION>. in 1962. Under <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON>, the company expanded in the 1970s and 1980s, making his family worth billions and vaulting <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> to the third-biggest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retailer behind No. 1 <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> and second-ranked <ORGANIZATION> K </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. At 70, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> remains He has retained the title of chairman although the company's day-to-day operations are handled by Glass, 53. A visitor to a <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> immediately senses workers are aiming to foster a friendly image, as though trying to preserve the charm historically associated with the neighborhood shops that many retail chains now threaten. When customers step inside an official greeter, sometimes in the form of a hand-clasping retiree, ushers them in, offering advice or just a `` how-do-you-do.'' Regular Wal-Mart stores attempt to provide one-stop shopping for consumers, stocking basic neccesities ranging from shoes and clothes to televisions and outdoor grills. Three <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> supercenters and three hypermarts, marketing experiments that are attracting hordes of customers, offer a wider array of merchandise, such as full grocery lines. Within the <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Waxahachie </LOCATION>, a community about 25 miles south of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, everything appears tidy with merchandise in its proper place, typical of Wal-Marts elsewhere. Workers known as `` associates'' in the corporate patois, patrol the floor, retrieving hangers, unwanted items and the clutter that bargain-hunters sometimes leave behind. One of <LOCATION> Waxahachie </LOCATION>'s assistant managers, <PERSON> Millie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, says <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> encourages associates to be helpful. `` It might be beyond what other discount stores do but I do n't think it's beyond <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION>,'' she says. What really draws customers, though, is price. `` You can find the same stuff at <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> that you can find at other stores but cheaper,'' says <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> regular <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Starks </PERSON> while lunching with three of her four children at a McDonald's near the <LOCATION> Wal-Mart </LOCATION> in the east <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Gilmer </LOCATION>. `` The clothes we have on came from <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION>, the shoes we have on came from <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION>.'' In the <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> she frequents, a 16 ounce bottle of Suave balsam and protein shampoo was selling for $ 1.08 while the supermarket a few doors away in the same mall offered the same for $ 1.69. Four rolls of Charmin toilet tissue went for 96 cents in <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> vs. $ 1.45 at the supermarket. Bounty designer kitchen towels were 78 cents in <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> and $ 1.07 in the store nearby. <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION>'s flag-waving patriotism also seems to have struck a responsive chord in the small towns and cities in the heartland, where the chain has multiplied. Anecdotal evidence suggests the company has won customers through publicity programs such as its `` Buy American'' pitch. If there's one big criticism, it's that local merchants _ especially small shops that ca n't buy in the volume that allows <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> to keep prices low _ get blown away when Wal-Marts move in. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, an economics professor at <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, looked into the impact of Wal-Marts after chambers of commerce and business people expressed concern about the consequences of new Wal-Marts in their areas. Stone's conclusions were mixed. Retail trade will expand, boosting business for some local merchants but causing others to lose sales, he found. The bottom line, <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>'s study shows, is that a strategy should be developed `` for existing merchants so that they may better co-exist in a <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> environment.'' Glass concedes Wal-Marts can make big economic waves. He says some businesses may flee from their competitive might, but overall, the chain tends to benefit areas by drawing customers to many stores. `` In the aggregate, I would argue that we have a good impact on a community by making it a trade center, a place where people come to shop,'' he says. Wall Streeters praise <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION>, especially the chain's application of computer technology to most routine retailing tasks, including inventory control The past decade is the best evidence of <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION>'s phenomenal growth. As of Jan. 31, the company ran 1,259 <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> stores, 105 <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>'s Wholesale Clubs _ outlets for shoppers buying in bulk _ and about two dozen other retail operations. At the start of 1979, <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> ran 276 stores. This year, the company plans to open 155 Wal-Marts and 20 wholesale clubs. The opening of new stores has helped maintain momentum in sales growth, which was 29 percent in 1988 when sales rose to $ 20.65 billion from $ 15.96 billion. Earnings last year totaled $ 837 million, or $ 1.48 a share, vs. $ 628 million or $ 1.11 a share a year earlier. The company's ambitious plans have expanded to the concept of supercenters and hypermarts, which are huge mega-merchandizing emporia with everything from groceries to computer software under one roof. Judging from <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION>'s stock market performance, the company has faithful followers. One analyst estimates the price of a <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> share will rise to $ 49 this year from about $ 32 recently. On the cost side, the corporation is known for dealing shrewdly with suppliers for the best possible price. Its operating expenses, as a proportion of sales, are the lowest industrywide. In a recent report on the company, <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loeb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> had nothing bad to say. `` The customer is key to the success of <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION>. Management is insisting that every customer be treated as a guest in <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> stores,'' <PERSON> Loeb </PERSON> wrote. `` This unique attitude is producing a strong response from consumers since service with a smile is often a forgotten commodity in retailing.''

<TEXT>
 In the <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> parking lot, a car radio plays a country ballad about a relaxed, `` porch swing state of mind.'' Outside the store's entrance, a vendor sells corn dogs and cold soda. Nearby, a woman gently coaxes her young daughter into getting off the small merry-go-round; two rides are enough, she says, `` Mommy's got to go shopping now. Reluctantly, the little girl dismounts and tags along into the store. Her pout gives way to a grin as a smiling woman greets the child with a `` Hi honey!'' while fixing a happy-face sticker on her hand. Anyone entering the <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> in this east <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> town _ and Wal-Marts elsewhere _ encounters such a person. The people greeters welcome shoppers, give advice on where to find things and mark merchandise carried in for returns or exchanges. On the way out of some Wal-Marts, exit greeters thank people for coming while keeping an eye out for receipts to make sure people are n't shoplifting. The people-greeting practice is one of many ingredients in <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s highly successful retailing recipe. Staffing entrances and exits is not unheard of at other retailers, particularly at discounters that have heavy traffic. What sets Wal-Marts appart is the way they handle the task. Customers in some high-volume stores feel bullied by employees demanding that they reveal the contents of parcels, for instance. Not in Wal-Marts. <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> `` associates,'' the term the company has substituted for employees, give the impression that the security element of people-greeting is secondary to acting like a friendly host or hostess. They appear to genuinely enjoy passing the time with patrons. `` I get to see everybody who comes to <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> and everybody in <LOCATION> Upshur </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> comes to <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> sooner or later,'' says <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> while on duty at the entrance of the <ORGANIZATION> Gilmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a 39-year-old <PERSON> Gilmer </PERSON> resident who won an award for being the most courteous employee in the county in February, speaks proudly about working at <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION>. She's grateful to have the job. Other people living in the area of <PERSON> Gilmer </PERSON>, a town of an estimated 6,500 people about 120 miles east of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Upshur </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> seat, are less fortunate due to deep staff cuts at a local steel mill and the prolonged slump in the state's oil industry. <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> store managers say not all associates are suited for people-greeting duty. Besides friendliness and maturity, useful personality traits are patience and perhaps a touch of inquisitiveness, some say. Retirees supplementing their fixed incomes are frequently found doing stints on <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION>'s hospitality patrol. One of them, 68-year-old <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, says being a people greeter at the <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Duncanville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, fits his needs fine. After 20 -LCB- years working in the warehouse of a tractor company, he enjoys less physically-demanding work. Deploying someone at <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> doors originated with one of the hourly associates. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON>, company founder and chairman, liked the suggestion and it became a company-wide practice.

 The store manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> in this community on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> tells a story that gives an insight into the man considered responsible for a retailing phenomenon. Manager <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Bost </PERSON> remembers one day last summer when a secretary telephoned from <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s corporate headquarters in <LOCATION> Bentonville </LOCATION>, Ark. Chairman <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> was about to land at a nearby airport and the secretary asked if someone could fetch him and bring him to the <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Soto </PERSON> store. Paying unexpected calls on stores is one way <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> has kept in close touch with everyday goings-on. His example is followed by other <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> executives and most make a point of spending a lot of time in the field. Says <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>, district manager for 9 stores in the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> metropolitan area, `` It's not like ` Uh-oh, someone's coming,' because they're always out.'' By all accounts, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON>'s personality permeates operations throughout the company. Everyone, from <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> President and Chief Operating Officer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Glass </PERSON> down to an hourly store worker, can readily quote the gospel according to <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>, as he is called. To paraphrase <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>'s primary rules of retailing, `` Rule No. 1 is the customer is always right Rule No. 2 says just in case the customer's wrong, revert to rule No. 1 If the principles sound old-fashioned and homespun, they are because that's the way <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> is, people who know him say. He shuns the limelight that his company's success has shed on him and has decided to refuse almost all press requests for interviews. He's happy to chat with folks in his stores, though. He also regularly reminds <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> `` associates'' that hospitality to customers is crucial. He preaches it in person or via high-tech satellite hookup with his stores. <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> employees became known as associates under a company effort to prove it cared about employees, partly to thwart a union organizing effort in the late 1960s. One of the most sensitive subjects for <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> is the fortune he's amassed A close associate says <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> would `` probably give anything'' not to be named on Fortune magazine's list of the country's wealthiest people. The magazine has estimated that his immediate family's stake in <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> stock is worth about $ 6.8 billion. `` <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> is more interested in his backhand than he is in his bank account,'' says <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Shinkle </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> turns 71 on March 29. He was born in <LOCATION> Kingfisher </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, and grew up as the son of a farm-mortgage banker. He graduated from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> with an economics degree in 1940 and joined <ORGANIZATION> J.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> as a management trainee in <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. After serving three years in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, he went to <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and opened a <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> five-and-dime store, eventually becoming the company's biggest franchisee. The seeds of the <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> empire were sown when <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> and his brother <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON>, or <PERSON> Bud </PERSON>, opened the first <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Discount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> in 1962. The rest will probably earn an entry in the history of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retail trade. <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> is a senior vice president and board member of <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION>. Three of the four grown children <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> had are involved with the company in various capacities. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> has n't slowed much, enjoying hunting and tennis as much as ever, and is said not to suffer after effects from a bout with leukemia, now in remission. He spends less time in the office since handing over most responsiblities to <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Glass </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> is still chairman of the board. Glass does n't hesitate when asked if <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> can flourish without <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>. The answer is an emphatic yes because, he says, `` We have great people.'' The <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> family will always be involved, he adds. Commenting on the future, Glass says: `` We'll be judged on what we produce today. Tomorrow, what we've done in the past wo n't matter.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In 1848, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> had just completed the scoring for `` Lohengrin'' when the idea for a work on the Nibelung _ dwarfs who owned a magic ring and a horde of gold _ began to crystallize. Twenty-eight years later, he put the final touches on the score of `` Der Ring des Nibelungen'' -LRB- `` The Ring of the Nibelungen'' -RRB-. It was a staggering accomplishment at the time and remains so today. Two major companies are about to meet the most difficult challenge in the world of opera _ producing <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>'s Ring, 17 hours of music originally intended by <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> to be performed over four days. The Metropolitan Opera will perform the entire epic about love and greed and gods and goddesses three times in the next few weeks _ the first time it has presented it in so short a span in 90 years. The <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION> is bringing its version to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in June. <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> deliberately made his Ring inaccessible to most theaters of the day, and he created an opera house in <LOCATION> Bayreuth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, in 1876 to show the work. `` I no longer gave a thought to the <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> or any other court theater in the world; my sole preoccupation was to produce something that should free me, once and for all, from this irrational subservience,'' the composer wrote in his autobiography. Few opera companies perform the four works _ `` <LOCATION> Das </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rheingold </LOCATION>,'' `` Die Walkure,'' `` Siegfried'' and `` Gotterdammerung'' _ in four days. Usually, the operas are seen singularly, or if produced as a ring cycle, are stretched out over weeks or months. `` Clearly <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> knew what he was doing,'' said <PERSON> Speight </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, general director of the <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opera </ORGANIZATION>. `` For the sake of the power of it, it needs to go the way it was meant to go.'' <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> started an annual Ring cycle in 1975. It is n't performing it this year because of the other two productions. Both productions are selling out, as <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> buffs from around the world scramble to attend one or both. At the Met, tickets for all four operas range from $ 60 to $ 620. Tickets at the Kennedy Center range from $ 120 to $ 380. The first cycle in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is June 2. The first Met cycle starts April 1. All will be broadcast live on radio. The Met's new production is the most traditional in the world. The rocky mountain top where <LOCATION> Brunnhilde </LOCATION>, surrounded by a circle of fire, is put into a deep sleep by her father, <PERSON> Wotan </PERSON>, resembles a craggy peak. But the production departs from the very earliest traditional stagings by eliminating her horse and not having the <ORGANIZATION> Valkyries </ORGANIZATION> actually fly. <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s Ring, new in 1985, is set in a futuristic tunnel designed by <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sykora </PERSON>. It was staged by <PERSON> Gotz </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedrich </PERSON>. Costumes are contemporary with punk underpinnings. In `` Das Rheingold,'' for example, <PERSON> Alberich </PERSON> is clothed in a diving suit with air hoses. And <LOCATION> Brunnhilde </LOCATION> wears black leather and leather boots in the later operas. `` It's very modern. It is hot, especially with the lighting of the stage. But it looks quite snazzy,'' said <PERSON> Dame </PERSON> <PERSON> Gwyneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who sang <LOCATION> Brunnhilde </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> last fall. `` It shows the personal, psychological relationships between the persons in the Ring. It is a human Ring. It's not political at all,'' said <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez-Cobos </PERSON>, general director of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION>. `` The idea is that every end is a new beginning. At the beginning of the Ring you see a vision from the very end, and at the very end you see once more the first picture of ` Rheingold.' It is life, going over and over.'' At <LOCATION> Bayreuth </LOCATION> in 1976 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the opera house <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> built, <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Boulez </PERSON> conducted and <PERSON> Patrice </PERSON> <PERSON> Chereau </PERSON> staged the first Ring ever taped for television. The Chereau Ring is a comment on corruption brought by industrialization. Instead of three mermaids swimming around, `` Rheingold'' starts with three prostitutes near a hydroelectric dam. In the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> production, <PERSON> Wotan </PERSON> is a stage director whose actors get out of hand. `` It's the only untraditional cycle in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> said. `` We try to be as mythic as possible. I think we follow very faithfully the words of the text and pay no attention to the stage instructions of <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>.'' The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION> is the only other American company performing a Ring. In 1985, when it was new, <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>'s unconventional Ring caused fistfights at cocktail parties. By 1987, it was accepted and sold out. <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> likes innovative approaches to staging the `` Ring.'' So does <PERSON> Lopez-Cobos </PERSON>, who's conducting the first cycle in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` Sometimes they go too far,'' <PERSON> Lopez-Cobos </PERSON> said. `` I prefer to take the risk. You are sometimes inspired by new and interesting concepts on the stage.'' <PERSON> Dame </PERSON> <PERSON> Gwyneth </PERSON> will sing <LOCATION> Brunnhilde </LOCATION> in the Met's third cycle. Next fall she'll sing in a Ring at the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION> and in a new `` Die Walkure'' at Covent Garden. The Welsh soprano has sung in a lot of Rings, including the televised <LOCATION> Bayreuth </LOCATION> cycle. One problem with the Ring in the latter half of this century has been that <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> liked it and considered it a glorification of a master race. Throughout its history it's story has been the subject of differing and often bizarre interpretations. The music, though, is another matter. In 1969, <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Cross </PERSON>, the late commentator on the Met's Saturday afternoon radio broadcasts, wrote that the music's greatness and majesty present the `` conflicts, tenderness, grandeur, heroism, passion and a tragedy that stirs us to the depths of our beings.'' <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>'s grandson, <PERSON> Wieland </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>, made a fresh start at <LOCATION> Bayreuth </LOCATION> in 1951 _ the first postwar Ring. With an almost barren stage, he stressed symbolism, thereby triggering the interpretive productions which have followed. Both the Met's and <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s current Rings replaced productions based on <PERSON> Wieland </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>'s. At the Met in 1975, the stage showed a ring shape _ a giant, tilted, flat doughnut _ with singers in costumes resembling dark choir robes. The lighting, mainly dark blue, set the psychological moods. The shortest amount of time in which one could attend all four operas in that 1975 Met Ring production was six weeks. The Met chose a traditional Ring, said artistic administrator <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Friend </PERSON>, because its audience prefers it. `` If you make a mistake with the Ring, it is a very expensive mistake. The more stylized a production is, the more difficult to get a larger proportion of our public to accept it. `` In some of the stylized productions, the text and music are at a complete opposite to what you're seeing on stage.

<HEAD>Gingrich Choice by GOP May Crimp Bush's Bipartisanship</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 It was intramural politics, an election settled by a bare majority of a chronic minority. But the leadership choice <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Republicans made last Wednesday may change the way both parties do business in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and could put a crimp in President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s new-look bipartisanship. The House GOP judgment seems to be that if they ca n't make laws, at least they can make noise. Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, newly elected as the assistant Republican leader of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, clearly intends to do just that. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, loudly conservative, said he will build a more aggressive, activist party. That is not the traditional task of the party whip, a job title that traces to Parliament and was around before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was. The whip's task is to line up votes, count heads, try to make sure his party's supporters are on hand when the roll is called. The best of them deal in the favors and compromises that oil any legislative machinery. It's a doubly difficult assignment when undertaken for the programs of a Republican administration in an overwhelmingly <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. But compromise is not <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>'s style. And he says the party wanted a new job description when he was chosen whip, 87 to 85, over Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Madigan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. He also says that his primary assignment is to work for House Republicans, not necessarily for President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Indeed, Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, the minority leader, said after <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> was chosen that he may have to take on some of the vote-counting and other duties that normally go to the whip. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>'s new deputy has no practice in those assignments. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> and his conservative allies argue that the way toward a Republican resurgence in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is confrontation, not compromise. They say that <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> GOP leaders have been too tractable and too anxious to get along with the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> majority. By now it seems a permanent majority, especially to frustrated political warriors like <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>. Republicans have n't controlled the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in 34 years, going on 35. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> lineup _ now 258 Democrats, 174 Republicans, with three seats vacant _ is determined in 435 separate elections every other year. National issues, trends and tickets affect those contests. State and regional issues, personalities and, above all, incumbency, affect them, too. The <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> game plan is based on the theory that the national side of that political equation can become the base for a Republican revival. That's in tune with the aggressive outlook of new leaders at the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the party's <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. It carries risks. Controlling <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, Democrats also control many of the perks, projects and federal favors that members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> seek for their districts and their constituents. Those are vital ingredients in the local side of a campaign for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. They can be punishing weapons _ a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> member needs to be able to deliver for the voters back home. Former Speaker of the House <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, an old <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> foe, always counseled that all politics is local. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> and company are on the opposite track, contending that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> can be won back on the strength of national Republican issues. The proof, if there is any, will be a long time coming, with an 84-seat Democratic margin which actually widened by three seats while Republicans were winning the presidency in 1988. The White House party usually loses <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seats in off-year elections like those coming in 1990. Time and again during their minority decades, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Republicans have looked to new leaders to change their lot. Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Halleck </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> ousted Rep. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> as minority leader in 1959, saying he offered new, vigorous leadership. Six years later, in another uprising, Rep. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> was elected leader, saying the party wanted new leadership, a new image and positive programs to counter the Democrats. When <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> was promoted from whip to leader in 1980, he said `` We're going to take the offensive.'' Now <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> says he'll do all that and more from the No. 2 job, although he obviously has his eye on the leadership.

<BYLINE>Inflation Control, Another Import From Japan? ^By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When the producer price index showed a big increase the other day it was as if a million Americans had shouted `` fire.'' Among those millions were investors, whose nervous systems had been imprinted by years of inflation fears. Believing inflation is ruinous for stocks, they nearly proved the thesis, knocking the averages for a loop. Economists, many of whom had been waiting at least two years for the inflation event, having prematurely forecast its onset, took bows and sent overnight letters to their clients saying, `` I told you so.'' The media joined in the excitement, dutifully finding `` experts'' who could identify the causes of the inflation problem and explain what damage might be expected _ that is, a recession, rising unemployment and the like. Then the consumer price index was released. The numbers in this report were much lower or, as some headlines stated, `` more modest'' than the bawdy producer prices. The president said he was encouraged. An economist declared the inflation numbers had returned to sanity. The departure from sanity was of course not in the brainless numbers but in the interpretation by humans. And what that interpretation showed is that when you expect inflation, almost any sign is an inflation sign. Americans have been under great stress for at least two years now, reminded almost daily that an expansion that lasts 77 months, as this one has, is destined to be consumed at almost any time by the fires of inflation. The explanations: You can not work your production facilities at the very high rate of 85 percent of capacity without adding to prices, because increasingly you are bringing onto line the least efficient plants and equipment. And you can not drop the jobless rate to near 5 percent without dipping into a labor pool of inexperienced and inefficient, and therefore costly and unproductive, workers. Moreover, with labor in short supply, wages must rise. Is that so? It might be. It might not. So many inflation-recession theories have been expounded that one has to question them all. Most of them can be logically presented. Many of them have merit, but a good many of them also leave something unexplained. If the most popular explanation is correct _ the one that says inflation is growing because of stress on job markets and plant capacity _ how do you explain the Japanese experience? <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s unemployment rate is about half the American rate, which is somewhere just above 5 percent a year. And <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s capacity utilization rate is only a couple of percentage points below the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rate. In addition, its money supply growth rate often has exceeded the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> money growth rate, the high level of which also has been named as a factor in inflation. And its budget deficit has sometimes been worse than <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s. Those four factors _ high plant utilization, low jobless rate, fast money supply growth and big budget deficits _ are probably the four most popular explanations for present and future inflation. Many of the economists who use these factors to explain <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inflation, and who forecast a recession for Americans this year, have little to say of the Japanese anomaly. It is, it seems, another impenetrable Oriental mystery. It is true that the Japanese have a high savings rate. And that those savings help finance larger and more efficient production. And that the Japanese are hard workers. But there is more to it than that. The explanation could be the most beneficial Japanese import of all, better than cars, cameras, TVs, VCRs and computers.

 The government said it will try <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and a top executive for a third time on stock fraud charges despite a mistrial that defense lawyers called a major setback in the pursuit of Wall Street corruption. `` We still have a great deal of faith in our evidence in this case,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Benito </PERSON> <PERSON> Romano </PERSON> said Wednesday after a federal judge declared her second mistrial. `` It's appropriate to try the case again.'' The <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> case was the first criminal trial stemming from the insider trading scandals of the mid-1980s and considered a critical test of information supplied by jailed stock speculator <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>. After 12 days and more than 90 hours of deliberations, the jury of nine women and three men in federal court in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> said they were hopelessly deadlocked in a three-way split and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> declared the mistrial. On Jan. 10 <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> declared a mistrial after determining prosecutors unintentionally withheld an expert's report that a key piece of evidence had been altered. <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION>, two subsidiaries and Vice Chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> were indicted last July for allegedly trying to boost <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s stock price in 1986 shortly before selling a large block of Carbide shares. They also were charged with securities fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy. <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> is a <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON>, N.J.-based chemical and building materials manufacturer with operations worldwide. Its chairman, <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Heyman </PERSON>, was named by prosecutors as an unindicted co-conspirator in the case. <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON>, 55, of <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, hugged his wife as the mistrial was announced. Sweating profusely, he told reporters outside the courtroom, `` My family and I are all just completely exhausted.'' The government had made <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> its leadoff case in a series of trials scheduled for this year that hinge on the confessions and testimony of Wall Street figures who already have admitted securities law violations. Defense lawyers said they would fight any move by the government to retry the case. `` If a jury can not agree despite 12 days of patient deliberations I believe it's a waste of resources to continue to try this case,'' lead <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Liman </PERSON> said. Wall Street securities fraud lawyer <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Arkin </PERSON> said the mistrial indicated the government was failing in its attempt to bring criminal charges in what should be civil cases. `` I do n't think this case demonstrated any harm,'' he said. `` It never seemed to me like a criminal case and I do n't think it is.'' <PERSON> Romano </PERSON> denied that the mistrial marked a defeat for the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office, which has brought charges in more than 50 securities fraud cases since 1983. All prior criminal frauds, including pending charges against the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, were settled through plea bargains. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> agreed in December to settle securities fraud charges unrelated to the <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> case by pleading guilty to six felonies and paying a record $ 650 million. In a separate development, the government on Wednesday obtained its first conviction in a Drexel-related case as a jury convicted former <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> assistant trader <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of perjury and obstruction of justice. The government's case against <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> was based largely on the testimony of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> broker <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON>, an admitted felon expected to play a key role in other securities fraud cases as part of a plea arrangement with the government. The purpose of the alleged stock manipulation was to maximize <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION>'s profits from the planned sale of a large block of <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> stock after a failed takeover of the much larger chemical concern earlier in 1986. Defense lawyers branded <ORGANIZATION> Jefferies </ORGANIZATION> a crook who had schemed illegally with <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, who paid $ 100 million to settle insider trading charges in late 1986. <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> fingered <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON>, 58, who last year agreed to plead guilty to two securities law violations. <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON>' testimony is seen as crucial to separate Boesky-derived cases against speculator <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> and takeover specialist <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON>. On the ninth day of deliberations, the jury reported an 11-1 split but resumed discussions after the judge asked them to reconsider their positions in the interests of reaching a verdict. It was not known whether the lone juror was for acquittal or conviction, but some jurors clearly changed their minds, leading to the three-way deadlock. <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> and the two subsidiaries faced maximum fines totaling $ 12 million, or $ 500,000 on each of eight counts against each of the three. <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> faced 40 years in prison and a fine of up to $ 2 million.

 The perjury conviction of a young assistant bond trader at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> will help the government's ongoing investigation of the powerful Wall Street investment firm, prosecutors said A federal jury found <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, 26, guilty of perjury and obstruction of justice Wednesday in a case with links to the government's most prominent target: multimillionaire <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> bond financier <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a one-time runaway who climbed to a $ 100,000-a-year job at the giant brokerage firm, faces a total of 35 years in jail and a maximum fine of $ 1.75 million. Sentencing was set for May 22. It was the first trial of a <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> employee after more than two years of investigations. Defense lawyers alleged that the government overzealously prosecuted <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who was charged with lying to a federal grand jury about alleged shady stock deals involving <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Princeton-Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LP </ORGANIZATION>, a now-defunct <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> securities firm whose partners face racketeering charges. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who made $ 117,000 last year and still is on <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s payroll, worked for former <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> trader <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Newberg </PERSON>, one of the Princeton-Newport defendants, who in turn reported directly to <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> has been informed by the government to expect to be indicted on fraud and racketeering charges. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Benito </PERSON> <PERSON> Romano </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> conviction, which did not involved securities law violations, would nonetheless help future cases. `` I think perjury convictions help all law enforcement investigations,'' he said. `` I think -LRB- this case -RRB- is a tragedy because this defendant did n't or could n't understand what was required of her and could have avoided this but did n't,'' <PERSON> Romano </PERSON> added Defense lawyer <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> said he would appeal the verdict. He equated <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> to a `` little person run down by a truck.'' During the trial, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> broke down repeatedly on the stand as she was grilled about her life and the grand jury testimony on her work as an assistant trader at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, high-yield junk bond department. Her job included placing orders and writing up trading tickets. To help prove their case, prosecutors showed <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> lied about her age, marital status, birthplace and education. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> told a federal grand jury in January 1988 she did n't recall any discussions about stock `` parking'' _ when one investor buys stock for another to conceal its true ownership _ in her contacts with <PERSON> Princeton-Newport </PERSON>. Parking is n't illegal, but the government is seeking to demonstrate that such deals violate securities laws if conducted with fraud in mind. Prosecutors showed <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> handled transactions in which Princeton-Newport sold securities to <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and repurchased them at a prearranged price 31 days later. They claim the deals were designed so Princeton-Newport could retain ownership while claiming losses for tax purposes. The government's star witness in the <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> trial, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> <PERSON> Hale </PERSON>, a former junior trader at Princeton-Newport, testified that he and <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> parked stocks in 1985 and knew it was illegal. The link is considered important. <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> is expected to testify against Princeton-Newport and possibly <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> about the questionable trades. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' lawyer maintained she did n't know what parking was, could n't remember every trade she executed during eight years at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and was bullied by government investigators who knocked on her door in late 1987 in connection with the Princeton-Newport probe. Princeton-Newport defense attorneys said they doubt the <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> case will have any direct impact on their trial, set for June 5, other than showcasing <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> as a witness. They also chastised the government for its treatment of <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who they said revealed little that would would help make racketeering charges stick. `` For all practical purposes, her credibility has been so destroyed that it is unlikely she will ever be used as a witness by either side,'' said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, who represents <ORGANIZATION> Princeton-Newport </ORGANIZATION> partner <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>. `` She is a tragic figure caught in the middle.'' The <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> case has no direct bearing on the government's settlement with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> over complaints stemming from information supplied by now-imprisoned speculator <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> The firm agreed to pay $ 650 million and plead guilty to six felonies to settle criminal fraud charges. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Anreder </PERSON> said the firm had not decided whether <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> will be fired. She was on a paid leave of absence from <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, which paid her legal fees.

 Eyes, not instruments, are the best detectors of airplane structural problems, according to members of a task force trying to determine how to ensure the safety of the nation's aging aircraft fleet. `` The most important thing you can do today is to be around an airplane and be alert,'' said <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosgrove </PERSON>, engineering vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, whose planes have been involved in some widely publicized incidents involving structural failure. `` Eighty percent of all damage is found by eyeballs,'' he said. <PERSON> Cosgrove </PERSON>, and other members of the task force formed by the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> spoke Wednesday at an aircraft maintenance and ground support trade show in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. The task force was formed last year after a section of fuselage ripped off a 19-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 over <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. A flight attendant was killed and 61 people were injured in the incident, which focused public attention on the increasing age of the nation's airplanes. There have been several other highly publicized incidents recently, the most serious also occuring over <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and involving a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> plane. Last month, a section of the fuselage of a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 tore off just after the plane left <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. Nine people died when they were sucked out of the airliner. `` Current economic and market conditions have resulted in the use of airplanes beyond their original economic design goal,'' said <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Kizer </PERSON>, engineering and maintenance vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. While the public has become aware of the age of the planes, estimated to average 12.7 years, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> executive who chaired the task force said age alone has little to do with an airplane's airworthiness The number of flights, the environment in which the planes operate, and the attention paid to regular maintenance are more important factors, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Doll </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for technical services. `` I do n't see why there would be'' a limit to the operational age of an aircraft, providing it is properly maintained, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Cosgrove </PERSON> said the company has inspected 20-year-old aircraft that look as if they just rolled off the assembly line, and other, much younger aircraft in much worse shape. `` It's really down to the guts of an airline's organization,'' <PERSON> Cosgrove </PERSON> said. `` Inspection and maintainence of an aircraft, whether it is one year or 20 years old, is important.'' Whether closer visual inspection would have averted the <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> disaster is unclear, indicated <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Trippe </PERSON> <PERSON> Nall </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> member who is leading the investigation. <PERSON> Nall </PERSON>, in a separate speech Wednesday, said investigators found stress fractures around screw holes near the damaged area of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s fuselage. As a result, the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> _ although not ready to release its full findings _ already has recommended some screw holes be redesigned on the 737s to change their stress point. <PERSON> Nall </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> findings likely will be released May 9 when the board has its next regular meeting. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Doll </PERSON> said the task force was concerned about the varied levels of maintenance practices it found throughout the industry. Although he defended <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s inspectors, <ORGANIZATION> Doll </ORGANIZATION> said the task force was working on how to raise expertise industrywide. Doll balked at one questioner's suggestion that it would be better to replace old aircraft rather than update them. `` If we pay $ 130 million -LRB- for a new plane -RRB- every time the ashtrays get dirty, you're not going to be able to afford the ticket,'' he said. Industry experts estimate that only about 15 jetliners have been scrapped voluntarily by the airlines during the last decade. In the meantime, airlines are rapidly buying planes, but Doll noted that most of the planes are being used for expansion and not replacement of older aircraft. The <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Nall </PERSON> stressed that training and following regulations are the best ways to keep airplanes safe.

 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which has spent much of its time lately fielding questions about aircraft quality, has plenty of good news for a change: two major new aircraft orders and prospects of record employment. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> announced in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Wednesday it was ordering 35 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> jetliners, along with up to 150 Fokker-100 short-haul jets. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s share of that order is worth an estimated $ 1.8 billion to $ 2.1 billion. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Havilland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> said it received its largest order ever, a $ 425 million deal from <ORGANIZATION> GPA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jetprop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> for 38 Dash 8 Series 300 turboprop planes. And Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> said it planned to add 2,300 employees in the first half of 1989, with mid-year employment in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state reaching a company-record 102,000. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> currently employs 99,700 people in the state and 155,000 worldwide. The company has endured a rash of bad news recently, including reports of miswiring in some jets, delays in its new 747-400 jumbo jet, questions about the safety of older aircraft, and a series of crashes and mishaps involving <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> aircraft. But the tone at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION> was distinctively upbeat Wednesday. `` I think that would be fair to say,'' chuckled spokesman <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> when asked if the company was heartened by the American order. So far this year, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has announced orders for 102 jetliners worth more than $ 8.2 billion. If that pace continued through 1989, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> could set a record for order value for the fifth straight year, breaking last year's mark of $ 29.7 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> had orders for 636 jets in 1988, an industry record. American ordered 25 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 757-200s and 10 767-300ER aircraft, bringing American's total orders of those aircraft to 85 firm and 85 options. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said a mid-sized 757 sells for $ 46 million to $ 52 million, depending on configuration, while the wide-body, extended-range 767-300ER is priced at $ 72 million to $ 78 million. At those prices, the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> share of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION>'s order would be worth between $ 1.87 billion and $ 2.08 billion. `` American's been a good customer _ they are a good customer,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. `` To see them buying what we call the 757-767 family is very encouraging. It's another indication that last year's surge in 757 sales will continue.'' Last May 26, American ordered 50 757s, valued at about $ 2 billion, and took options on 50 more. The next day, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> ordered 30 of the planes, worth about $ 1.3 billion and optioned the same number. Those orders were seen as a strong vote of confidence for the 757, a fuel-efficient, quiet aircraft that had been a slow seller since its introduction in the early 1980s. To date, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has announced orders for 447 757s and 372 767s. GPA Jetprop, a partnership between <ORGANIZATION> GPA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> PWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Calgary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION>, is a major lessor of turboprop aircraft. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Appleton </PERSON>, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Havilland </PERSON> vice president for marketing and sales, said its order is probably the largest ever for a single model of turboprop airliner. `` This order transforms us to a central role in the turboprop acquisition business,'' said <PERSON> Naill </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, GPA Jetprop managing director. `` We have gone from being a boutique to being a department store.'' The twin-engine Dash 8 Series 300 carries 50 to 56 passengers and is used primarily on commuter routes. With GPA <PERSON> Jetprop </PERSON>'s order, de Havilland has firm orders and options for 86 of the aircraft, valued at more than $ 1 billion. For the entire Dash 8 family, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Havilland </PERSON> now has orders and options for 297 aircraft from 34 customers. GPA Jetprop earlier ordered nine Dash 8 Series 100 aircraft, which carry 37 to 40 passengers, and took options on another five. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has been hiring about 900 workers per month, with employment expected to level off by mid-1989. Most of the new hires will be at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Everett </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION> widebody jet plant, where the company is hustling to get deliveries of the 747-400 back on schedule, company spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Binder </PERSON> said. In 1988, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s total employment rose by nearly 11,000, or 7.7 percent, to 153,000. The company is predicting job growth will be at about 5 percent this year. `` It's slowing somewhat, but if you look at the level of economic activity generated by <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> right now, it's just extraordinary,'' said <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Pedersen </PERSON>, vice president and economist with <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>U.S. Appeals Court Upholds Block to Consolidated Gold Fields Takeover</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court has upheld a preliminary injunction blocking <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 5.7 billion hostile bid for <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fields </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> on antitrust grounds. A three-judge panel of the 2nd <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> also said Wednesday <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>'s bid should be sent back to a lower court for consideration of whether it violates <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> securities laws. <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>, which is largely controlled by two South African corporations, <ORGANIZATION> Anglo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, launched its bid for Gold Fields, a British firm, last fall. <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> corporation, already held nearly 30 percent of Gold Fields' stock. Gold Fields has resisted the bid in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, and also filed an antitrust action here. <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> `` is the largest producer of gold in the non-communist world, accounting for 20.3 percent of all gold production in the western world,'' according to court papers. Gold Fields, meanwhile, has significant gold mining holdings in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, including 90 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Newmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION>, the largest gold producer in the country. Gold Fields `` accounts for 12 percent of the western world's gold production, making it the second-largest gold producer in the non-communist world,'' according to court papers. The company's <ORGANIZATION> Newmont </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary claimed that because it costs less to mine and produce gold in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> than in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> eventually would shut down <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> operations if the takeover was accomplished. `` <ORGANIZATION> Newmont </ORGANIZATION>'s claim is that its ability to compete in the marketplace will be reduced by anti-competitive influence, exercised from inside its own boardroom'' if the <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> bid succeeded, wrote Circuit Judge <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> in the 2nd Circuit's 25-page opinion. `` <ORGANIZATION> Newmont </ORGANIZATION>'s threatened injury is precisely the type that the antitrust laws were designed to protect against,'' the court said in a 2-to-1 decision upholding an injunction imposed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Mukasey </PERSON>. Late last year, <PERSON> Mukasey </PERSON> issued a preliminary injunction preventing <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Anglo </ORGANIZATION> American and <ORGANIZATION> DeBeers </ORGANIZATION> from proceeding with their tender offer until the antitrust issue was resolved in the courts. Just before <PERSON> Mukasey </PERSON>'s ruling, the <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> bid was referred to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Monopolies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mergers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> for investigation of possible anti-competitive consequences in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION> on such strategic metals as titanium and zircon. British law prohibited further action on the takeover bid until Feb. 2 when the commission found that the acquisition of Gold Fields would not operate against the British public interest, the 2nd Circuit opinion noted. With that ruling, <PERSON> Mukasey </PERSON>'s injunction remained the only legal obstacle to <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>'s offer. <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> said it would nopt buy any new shares unless the injunction was lifted or modified. In seeking the injunction, Gold Fields also claimed <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> violated the anti-fraud provisions of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> securities laws, for allegedly making and false and misleading statements about how much control South African corporations and individuals have over it. Gold Fields claimed the Oppenheimer family of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> indirectly controls <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Anglo </ORGANIZATION> American and <ORGANIZATION> DeBeers </ORGANIZATION> and that the stigma of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s apartheid racial policy could make it difficult to conduct business in some countries. The appeals court sent the case back to <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> for further consideration of the fraud issue. In his decision, <PERSON> Mukasey </PERSON> claimed he lacked jurisdiction in rejecting a Gold Fields claim that its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investors entitled the concern to sue in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> courts alleging violations of federal securities law. About 2.5 percent of Gold Fields' outstanding shares are held by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens. But the 2nd Circuit panel, said `` the tender offer had sufficient effects within the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to warrant application of American securities laws.''

 Alarmed by slumping prices from the Alar scare, and dazzled by skyrocketing prices for chemical-free fruit, many <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> apple growers are rushing into experiments with organic farming. The interest is motivated more by economics _ primarily the 300 percent higher prices for organic apples _ than philosophy. `` I've had more calls in the past two or three weeks about growing fruit organically than in the past three years,'' said <PERSON> Brooke </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> tree fruit extension agent for <LOCATION> Yakima </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. `` Organic growing in the past was a philosophical question,'' <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said. `` Today it's economic. There are higher prices for it.'' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> produces half the nation's apples, and the 5,000 growers of the $ 312 million crop are unlikely to switch more than a small percentage of the orchards to chemical-free growing. But rising consumer interest is creating a niche market many want to tap. At meetings in the apple belt communities of <LOCATION> Okanogan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wenatchee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Yakima </LOCATION> this week, Pacific Fruit Growers-Packers, <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> will discuss organic techniques with hundreds of growers. `` I think that organic farming is essentially another -LRB- apple -RRB- variety for us,'' said <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> McPherson </PERSON>, an assistant general manager for <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fruit </ORGANIZATION> and also a grower. `` There's definitely a market.'' In the wake of the nationwide Alar scare, prices for organically grown <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> apples have doubled to $ 48 per box. Prices for the top grade of commercially grown Red Delicious apples, in contrast, slumped another $ 1 this week to between $ 11 and $ 12 per 42-pound box, barely above the break-even point and $ 2 to $ 3 less than before the Alar scare. <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Dempster </PERSON>, of <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON>'s Produce in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, which markets organic fruit, said the gap between organic and standard apples is not usually so great. `` Normally its 20 to 50 percent higher -LRB- for organic -RRB-,'' she said. `` It's partly the Alar scare and a real increased demand.'' Organic growing has received a lot of attention in recent weeks, after a <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> report on pesticides in children's food said eating apples treated with Alar increased cancer risks in children. The industry disputes the findings and the federal government has reassured consumers that apples are safe to eat. But a <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> poll released this week found that 84.2 percent of those surveyed would choose organically grown food if given a choice. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> are the only states that have organic certification programs, where farmers attest they have not used synthetic fertilizers or pesticides. Only about 20 of the state's 5,000 apple growers are currently certified as organic growers, according to <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> <PERSON> McEvoy </PERSON> of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>. And a recent survey in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> found that only 1 percent of the produce is organically grown, he said. To be certified in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a grower must not have used artificial chemicals for two years, he said. `` We're seeing a lot of apple growers interested,'' said <PERSON> McEvoy </PERSON>, who runs the certification program. However, many growers contend it is impossible for the entire apple-growing industry to switch to organic techniques. A major reason is that the codling moth would devastate virtually the entire crop, infesting it with worms, <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said. But <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> growers are considering experimenting with a variety of techniques. <PERSON> McPherson </PERSON> said he plans to hide 12 acres of organically-grown apples in the middle of his orchards, surrounded by 48 acres of chemically-treated apples. The pests normally stop at the first available tree to lay their eggs, and he hopes that surrounding the vulnerable chemical-free trees with a ring of sprayed trees will keep the moth away. There are other techniques being developed to handle the codling moth without artificial chemicals, <PERSON> McEvoy </PERSON> said. But, he added, `` Apples are by far the hardest thing to grow organically in the state.''

<HEAD>Report: First City Interested in MCorp</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> bank holding company that was saved with the help of federal regulators last year is now bidding to acquire troubled <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION>, a newspaper reported today. The Dallas Morning News, quoting anonymous industry sources, said <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancorporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbout </PERSON> has approached federal regulators about bidding to acquire Dallas-based MCorp. <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON> is working on a bid with the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment firm, <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jenrette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which helped raise the $ 500 million last April that allowed him take over Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION>. That deal included $ 1 billion in <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> aid. <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> <PERSON> Lufkin </PERSON> officials could not be reached for comment Wednesday. A First City spokesman told The News he could neither confirm nor deny any interest in <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> by <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON>. Combining First City, with $ 11 billion in assets, and <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION>, an $ 18.8 billion institution, would raise a host of issues for the government, particularly because of terms of the previous deal with <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION>. That transaction gives the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> a stake in the company's ability to collect on its bad loans. The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> will recoup some of its investment based on the collections on soured loans made under the previous First City management. A number of observers speculated that <PERSON> Abboud </PERSON> would consider a bid for <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION> only if federal regulators first declared the company's banks insolvent, avoiding the process he endured in taking over <LOCATION> First </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION>'s most troubled banks include MBank <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> MBank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION>, two of its largest susidiaries. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported that nearly a third of <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION>'s banks had exhausted their equity capital by the end of 1988, leaving them virtually insolvent and opening the door for regulators to seize assets. <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> figures show that seven MBanks around <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, including four of the company's seven largest banks, reported negative equity _ exhausting shareholder funds _ at the end of 1988; representing $ 11.8 billion of <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 18.8 billion asset base. <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>, has indicated he wants the company to remain independent. He said last October that the company could raise new capital to combine with <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> aid, which analysts have estimated would exceed $ 1 billion. The government said in November that it would consider management's proposal while seeking other bids. Few suitors have surfaced, partly because of complications that might arise in trying to buy the company's banks without the cooperation of Bishop. <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION>'s management also has retained about $ 400 million in cash and other assets in the holding company. <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> has indicated that money may be available for helping the company's banks only as part of a management-blessed reorganization.

The <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> signed a contract Thursday to team up with <PERSON> Kumagai </PERSON> <PERSON> Gumi </PERSON>, one of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s biggest construction firms, in an 11.2 billion yen, the equivalent of about $ 85 million, construction project in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Shuwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Shuwa </ORGANIZATION>, one of the largest Japanese holders of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> real estate, owns 37 buildings in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, including <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Richfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plaza </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and the ABC Building in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> The companies said <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'s portion of the joint venture would be 10 percent. <PERSON> Kumagai </PERSON> <PERSON> Gumi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> agreed last summer to cooperate in construction projects in the two countries, and are jointly involved in three projects in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Commerce Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> welcomed Thursday's contract as a `` fine example'' of private Japanese industry honoring the spirit of last May's bilateral construction agreement, in which <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> agreed to give <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies access to a range of public works projects `` Most significant is that this private-sector project is outside of that accord, but reflects most clearly our goal that American companies be given the opportunity to introduce their expertise and experience to all sectors of the Japanese market,'' <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> said in a statement. `` I want to make a small contribution to alleviating trade friction,'' <ORGANIZATION> Shuwa </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Shigeru </PERSON> <PERSON> Kobayashi </PERSON> told a news conference after the signing. `` Instead of arguing and negotiating, the two sides should promote more joint activities.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have charged that Japanese bidding practices and other industry customs have blocked foreign entry into the Japanese construction market. Japanese builders have denied that foreigners are excluded, and say <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> construction firms showed little interest in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> before the bilateral pact. `` I do n't think the customs would prevent us,'' Turner Senior Vice President <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> said after the contract signing. `` From our perspective, the Japanese government and certainly <ORGANIZATION> Shuwa </ORGANIZATION> have been providing the opportunities.'' <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> said his company was more interested in increasing its business in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other countries through the <ORGANIZATION> Shuwa </ORGANIZATION> venture than in increasing its access to the Japanese market. `` It does n't make a lot of sense to beat your head against the wall ... unless there's something that you can bring to the table that's different than what the very capable industry can deliver over here,'' he said. `` The world's a very big place ... and at the moment there are more than enough opportunities in the world with better prospects where we can bring something to the table.'' <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> discounted what he described as `` paranoia'' in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> about an erosion of market share for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> contractors resulting from the arrival of Japanese developers. `` The Japanese have brought building opportunities to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> which probably would n't have been there because there was n't anybody to invest in those projects,'' he said Earlier this month, <ORGANIZATION> Tishman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realty </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> announced it was forming a joint venture with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Aoki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to build a luxury hotel in <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION> in what it said was the first private construction agreement by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company following the bilateral pact

<HEAD>Annual Inflation Rate Rises to 7.8 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s annual inflation rate jumped to an unexpectedly high 7.8 percent in February, from 7.5 percent the previous month, largely because of rising mortgage rates, the government said Thursday. The higher mortgage rates stem from the government's drive to push up interest rates as a way of fighting <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s resurgent inflation, which Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> repeatedly has said is her top economic priority. Excluding mortgage payments, the annual rate of inflation stood at 5.7 percent, said <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>, secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION>. The annual rate was above the 7.7 percent rate the markets had been expecting and fueled speculation that interest rates might be hoisted even higher than their current 13-percent level. The pound held steady on the news. But share prices surprisingly gained, as investors took the report in stride ahead of the long Easter holiday weekend. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index, which had been down 6.4 points before the report, was down 2.7 points, or 0.1 percent, at 2,045.9 afterward. `` The reaction was very muted,'' said one <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> trader. `` For some people maybe, the figures were n't as scary as they thought.'' Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> warned during his fiscal budget speech earlier this month that he expected <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s annual inflation rate to peak at around 8 percent in the middle of year, and that he expected the underlying rate, excluding mortgage rates, to peak at 5.5 percent, a level it surpassed with the latest report. `` The chancellor already has some egg on his face,'' said <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardiner </PERSON>, economist at the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Warburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. `` The market was a little bit disappointed by the figures.'' <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> also said he expects the annual inflation rate to decline to 5.5 percent by the fourth quarter of 1989 and to 4.5 percent by the second quarter of 1990. `` Higher interest rates, which are affecting inflation in the short term, will help bring the rate down in the longer term,'' <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>, the employment secretary, said. `` Indeed, retail sales have eased off and the recent figures show the underlying trend to be broadly flat since autumn.'' The commercial banks' base lending rate has risen to its current 13 percent from 7.5 percent last summer. The department said retail prices rose 0.7 percent in February from January. It said its retail price index stood at 111.8 in February, 111.0 in January and 103.7 in February 1988. The index uses a 1987 base of 100. The department also blamed the higher prices on clothing, shoes and household goods following January sales. Gasoline prices also were up, it said.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy grew at a moderate annual rate of 2.4 percent in the final three months of last year, even better than previously believed, the government said today. But the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the increase in the gross national product, the broadest measure of economic health, was accompanied by a pickup in inflation, reflecting higher food costs and rising import prices. The 2.4 percent increase represented an upward revision from last month, when the government estimated that the GNP had grown at an annual rate of just 2 percent in the October-December quarter. The economy's momentum would have been an even stronger 3.5 percent except for the lingering effects of last summer's drought, which subtracted more than 1 percentage point from growth. However, the strong growth, propelled by high consumer demand, has economists and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> worried, given the tight labor markets and high factory operating rates. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> last month embarked on a renewed drive to push interest rates higher in an effort to dampen demand and cool off growing inflationary pressures. But the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration and some private economists have complained that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> may be in danger of overdoing that effort and end up pushing the country into a recession. Despite some alarming reports on inflation in January and February that sent the stock market plunging, many analysts believe that growth is slowing and the central bank does not need to do more in its anti-inflation efforts. First word on the GNP performance for the first three months of 1989 will be released in April. An inflation index tied to the GNP rose at a sharp annual rate of 5.3 percent in the October-December quarter, up from a 4.7 percent rate of increase in the third quarter. Since the index, known as the GNP deflator, has been rising at annual rate of 3.8 percent or less for the past three years, analysts said the uptick over the 5 percent mark indicated that inflationary pressures have increased. In a look at how <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses performed, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said corporate profits after taxes shot up 14.6 percent in 1988, aided by a 2.8 percent rise in the fourth quarter. The annual increase was the best performance for corporate profits since a huge 22.4 percent jump in 1983, the year after the end of the steep 1981-82 recession. The upward revision in the GNP for the fourth quarter made growth for the entire year look slightly better. The government said the GNP rose 3.9 percent in 1988, the best performance since a 6.8 percent increase in 1984. The yearly GNP increase had been put at 3.8 percent earlier. The 2.4 percent GNP growth in the fourth quarter followed a 2.5 percent rise in the July-September quarter. While it was the slowest advance since a 1.4 percent rise in the fourth quarter of 1986, analysts said the pace was still too strong because the overall rate was held back by the drought. The government has said it expects growth in the first quarter of 1989 will be boosted by 2.5 percentage points, reflecting a bounce back from the drought. The upward revision for the fourth quarter reflected higher government spending than previously estimated and a smaller decline in business investment. The positive factors were offset somewhat by a larger trade deficit. The government said the gap between imports and exports shot up at an annual rate of $ 11.5 billion in the fourth quarter, the sharpest widening of the trade imbalance since the third quarter of 1986. While exports climbed by 6.5 percent, this improvement was swamped by a 13.5 percent rise in imports. Many analysts are fearful that the improvement in the trade deficit, which contributed almost half of total growth last year in the economy, has stalled out. These analysts predict that the combination of a worsening trade picture and the credit-tightening by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> will translate into much more sluggish growth this year. That possibility has the administration worried because President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is counting on economic growth remaining robust as a way of lowering the budget deficit without resorting to a tax increase. The administration's economic forecast, upon which it based its assumption that the budget deficit would decline below $ 100 billion next year, called for the GNP to expand at a healthy clip of 3.2 percent. However, private economists, even those who think the country can escape without a recession, are much more pessimistic. The latest consensus forecast from <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indicators </ORGANIZATION>, a financial newsletter which surveys 50 top economists each month, puts growth for 1989 at 2.7 percent, based on a belief that consumer spending, business investment and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports will all show less strength than in 1988. Many analysts believe there is plenty of evidence that the slowdown is already occurring in weaker consumer spending and slower business investment. On Wednesday, the government reported that orders to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories for `` big ticket'' durable goods declined for a second straight month in February, the first back-to-back monthly declines in three years. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jasinowski </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION>, said the decline in factory orders provided `` solid evidence that the economy is slowing down.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, said he believed the slowdown would not snowball into an outright recession even though he said the worse-than-expected inflation reports so far this year did increase the possibility of a slump.

 A partnership seeking to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is suing the company, claiming management is unfairly hindering its efforts to wage a proxy fight for control of the firm. <ORGANIZATION> SOQ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> limited partnership, announced Wednesday that it had filed a lawsuit in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, charging that <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> was illegally soliciting proxies for its April 11 annual meeting.

<HEAD>Holly Farms Board Rejects Tyson's $63.50-A-Share Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LITTLE ROCK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A judge in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> has ruled that an offer from <ORGANIZATION> Tyson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Springdale </LOCATION> to buy out the <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, is better than a rival offer from <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb </LOCATION>. But Vice Chancellor <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartnett </PERSON>'s 29-page decision Wednesday left it up to <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> stockholders to choose between the Tyson and <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> offers. <PERSON> Hartnett </PERSON> said shareholders would probably reject the proposed merger agreement from <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION>. Today, <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> announced that its board had decided to reject <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>'s offer of $ 63.50 per share and to recommend that stockholders not tender their shares pursuant to that offer. The board met Wednesday. Last week, <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> increased its offer to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> stock from $ 60 a share to $ 63.50 a share in a deal worth about $ 1.18 billion. <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> has offered a stock swap deal worth between $ 1.09 billion and $ 1.17 billion. But <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>, says his company's offer is worth much more. <PERSON> Hartnett </PERSON>'s ruling came in a suit by <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> asking that the judge stop a scheduled April 14 vote by <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> shareholders on the merger. The judge allowed the vote to proceed. Should shareholders approve the merger, <PERSON> Hartnett </PERSON> said he would n't allow the agreement to go through until he makes a decision on a so-called `` crown jewel lockup'' provision worked into the merger The provision would give <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> an option to buy prime assets from <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> if the merger fell through. The provision is intended to make an acquisition by <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> diffcult. <PERSON> Hartnett </PERSON> said the provision was tainted and probably unenforceable. The <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> board said in a news release today that by continuuing to condition its tender offer on the invalidity of the lockup agreement, `` <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> had failed to provide the board with the necessary assurance that <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> would complete an acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> on a timely basis, if at all. `` Unless and until <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> removes from its tender offer the Asset Option condition,'' a <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said in the release. `` Holly Farms' stockholders can have no assurance that <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>'s $ 63.50 price represents deliverable value For this reason, <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION>'s merger agreement still represents, in the board's view, the best alternative for our stockholders.'' <ORGANIZATION> Tyson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> has hired a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> firm to help it sway <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> stockholders in its direction. But the board of <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION>, which has said it prefers the offer from <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION>, has also hired a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> firm in an effort to keep its stockholders in the <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> camp. The management of <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> needs two-thirds of its shareholders of record to vote April 14 to approved its merger with <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION>.

 Officials of two of the three unions at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> _ including the striking Machinists _ are among the members of a committee representing unsecured creditors of the crippled carrier. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, the federal trustee supervising administration of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s bankruptcy reorganization appointed the 15-member committee Wednesday to represent the unsecured creditors, and included officials of the machinists and the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, which represents flight attendants at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, was not included. However, the creditors' panel does include a representative of non-union employees, most of whom were laid off a few days after the Machinists' walkout began and are demanding back pay. In <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, a federal appeals court today was scheduled to hear an <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> request to force pilots to cross Machinists' picket lines and go back to work The Machinists struck the airline on March 4 after 17 months of wrangling with management over a contract. The pilots' support for the walkout virtually grounded <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and forced it to file for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws on March 9. The Eastern pilots are owed more than $ 500 million in back pay and other claims, said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, a spokesman in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> for the pilots union. Flight attendants also honored the Machinists' picket lines. The creditors' committee has the right to review any reorganization plan proposed by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and can propose its own plan to the bankruptcy judge. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> told a gathering of around 400 creditor representatives, financial analysts and reporters the role of the creditors' panel is `` far more expansive'' than his. Eastern says it has $ 5.9 billion in assets and $ 4.5 billion in liabilities. Unsecured creditors, such as ticketholders and travel agents, are the most likely to lose money in a bankruptcy reorganization because they have no collateral, or security, from the debtor in case of default. The airline's secured creditors, mainly bondholders, met with Eastern President <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakes </PERSON> on Tuesday. Eastern's liabilities include $ 1.69 billion in long-term debt, $ 736 million in capital lease obligations and $ 165 million in unused tickets issued to passengers, <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, one of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s bankruptcy attorneys, told the creditors' meeting `` The objective of Chapter 11 is to rebuild <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a partner in the law firm Weil, <ORGANIZATION> Gotschal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manges </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s plan to resuscitate the airline and build back its flight schedule.'' The embattled airline recently started advertising for new pilots in newspapers. Only about 200 of the 3,600 or so pilots at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> have crossed Machinist picket lines to fly. Eastern is operating only a fraction of the flights in its normal schedule, except for nearly normal service on its Northeast air shuttle and to <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said 167 planes out of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s fleet of 254 aircraft are currently inactive, parked on airport runways in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. In addition to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION>, the other members of the unsecured creditors' committee are as follows. Where available, the amount owed them by Eastern is included: Aircraft manufacturer <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrie </ORGANIZATION>, $ 95.94 million; <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, $ 75.47 million; <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, $ 58.74 million; <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, $ 53.98 million; <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, $ 22.30 million; <ORGANIZATION> IBJ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schroder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, $ 19.56 million; <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, $ 12.76 million; <ORGANIZATION> Rolls-Royce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, $ 5.89 million; <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, $ 1.05 million; <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>, $ 800,876; <ORGANIZATION> Rohr </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aero </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>; and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> <PERSON> Shore </PERSON>, representing non-union employees of Eastern. Ms. Shore is an elected representative of a non-union group called PEACE, or <ORGANIZATION> Positive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, which union officials allege is sponsored by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> management. `` I think it's quite insulting that every employee group at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> is on the creditors' committee except the flight attendants,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, president of a <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> local representing <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> flight attendants. `` It's really a slap in the face.'' She asserted that Ms. Shore is really a representative of Eastern management rather than the airline's employees. `` That group -LRB- PEACE -RRB- is nothing but a union-busting group of people,'' Ms. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said today in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>.

 White House and congressional budget negotiators reported today that their talks have been `` cordial and constructive'' but that they were still some distance from reaching a spending compromise. `` What is most important is the clear understanding of every member of the negotiating group of the need for an effective budget agreement,'' the bargainers said in a letter to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders. The closed-door sessions, aimed at producing a fiscal 1990 spending plan, were put on hold Wednesday because of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' Easter recess and are scheduled to resume April 3 `` Our meetings have been both cordial and constructive,'' the letter said. `` A number of budget options have been discussed. We intend to continue to negotiate on the basis of these and other options in an effort to reach a compromise.'' `` It is our hope that we will achieve a compromise on the broad outlines of a resolution ... that can serve as the basis for congressional action within the next few weeks,'' it said. Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, D-Tenn., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said that `` because we have n't reached agreement today does n't mean we do n't have a good chance of reaching one down the road. Earlier this month, <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON> and his <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> counterpart, Rep. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, D-Calif., had promised to report to <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders today on the progress of the talks The two Democrats, however, warned that unless an agreement is reached with the White House in early April, they will write their own budget and attempt to move it through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think we're either going to have an agreement by the middle of April, or know we ca n't have an agreement,'' <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON> said his panel will begin writing its own spending plan if the talks fail to produce a deal within the first two weeks of April. <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON> was even more demanding, saying that for his panel to meet its deadlines, he believes the talks will have to produce a package within the first week in April. Under the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is supposed to complete its budget resolution by April 15. Later legislation is needed to provide the actual spending for programs. So far, the main players in the talks have been ranking Democrats and Republicans on both chambers' budget committees and <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> budget director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>. Administration officials have met intermittently with congressional budget writers ever since President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> introduced his $ 1.16 trillion spending plan on Feb. 9. In its effort to reach the Gramm-Rudman requirement of a deficit of no more than $ 100 billion, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal contained $ 14 billion in new revenues. The White House refuses to characterize them as new taxes; <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> pledged during his presidential campaign to oppose tax hikes. `` The limitation we're struggling with is the political limitation on revenues, and that continues to haunt these discussions,'' <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON> said. Democrats have complained that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s budget relies too heavily on domestic cuts for its savings, and have proposed an alternative that would reach half the deficit reduction goal with additional revenue, one-fourth through military cuts and one-fourth with domestic reductions. But <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON> said that so far in the talks, <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> has merely `` restated the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> budget, perhaps with minor differences.''

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>

 Wheat futures opened slightly higher this morning on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, partly in response to a diminshed chance for rain this weekend in the <LOCATION> central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> states where winter wheat is grown. Soybean and oat futures were mostly lower in early trading while corn was nearly unchanged. The early gains in the wheat market follow a steep sell-off on Wednesday prompted by forecasts for rain early next week in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and other key winter-wheat areas. But this morning's forecasts indicated the chances for rain this weekend in the central Plains were fading, encouraging some traders to buy wheat futures. Soybean futures opened slightly lower on profit-taking after Wednesday's rally, then turned mixed. Corn was nearly unchanged. In early trading, wheat was unchanged to 1 -LCB- cents higher with the contract for delivery in May at $ 4.27 \ a bushel; corn was unchanged to \ cent lower with May at $ 2.79 a bushel; oats were unchanged to -LCB- cent lower with May at $ 2.07 -RCB- a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents lower to 1 cent higher with May at $ 7.92 a bushel Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .20 cent lower to .25 cent higher with April at 78.30 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower to .32 cent higher with March at 79.75 cents a pound; live hogs were .20 cent lower to .17 cent higher with April at 42.60 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .20 cent lower to .03 cent higher with May at 38 cents a pound. Cattle futures settled lower on Wednesday while pork futures finished mixed.

<HEAD>De Beers Raises Prices 15.5 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The De Beers diamond cartel of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, citing strong demand, says it is increasing prices for rough gemstones an average 15.5 percent. The price increase for a broad range of uncut diamonds, announced Tuesday, is effective next week. It follows a 13.5 percent increase last May and a 10 percent increase in September 1987. De <ORGANIZATION> Beers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, which is based in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, controls 80 percent of the world's rough diamond market through its London-based marketing arm, Central Selling Organization. It does not disclose what the prices are. The cartel only sets prices for rough diamonds, which it does n't disclose, and operates a pipeline of diamonds from its mines in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> to dealers and cutters in the world's major diamond cutting centers, <LOCATION> Antwerp </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> It holds about 10 `` sights'' _ or sales _ for international diamond dealers a year, with the next one scheduled for next week. `` We are responding to prevailing conditions in the market. It was market-led,'' spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON> said Thursday about the price increase. Demand for rough diamonds of two carats and less is especially strong, he said. `` The industry is anticipating another good year in 1989 from retail diamond and jewelry sales,'' <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON> said. The generally weaker dollar has helped sales because diamonds are priced in dollars and holders of Japanese yen and <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> currencies get more for their money. In addition, sales should improve in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> after April 1 when a 15 percent tax in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> on luxury items costing about $ 300 or more is replaced with a flat 3 percent sales tax on all items, <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON> said. The markets in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> are particularly strong, with good advances also in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, he said. `` We are bringing rough prices up in line with those prices of polished diamonds that are prevailing within the diamond cutting centers,'' he said. The organization had record sales of $ 4.2 billion in 1988, up 37 percent from $ 3.08 billion in 1987, the previous record. Most of the world's diamonds are industrial diamonds, used primarily in drilling. Between 10 percent and 20 percent are gems.

 <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Liman </PERSON>, a gangly disheveled man with a Noo Yawk accent, probably is best known for picking apart <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> on national television as captive nation watched. `` <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, is n't it a fact ...,'' <PERSON> Liman </PERSON> prefaced each question to the deposed <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonel during the congressional Iran-Contra hearings that made <PERSON> Liman </PERSON>'s baggy face and half-moon ears a household image. His simple, direct, persistent style pierced the veil around the man President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> called a `` national hero'' and earned <PERSON> Liman </PERSON>, an outsider in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the admiration of fellow Democrats and Republicans alike, as well as bags of hate mail. `` It was like <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> who was vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee <PERSON> Liman </PERSON> served as general counsel two years ago. `` The guy is good.'' The guy is back in his native <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, returned to the highest -LRB- and highest-paid -RRB- echelons of the city's legal community and to the almost notoriety-free existence he prefers after a summer when every <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> cabbie knew him by name. <PERSON> Liman </PERSON>'s career has taken him from investigating the <LOCATION> Attica </LOCATION> prison riots, to defending the likes of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Vesco </PERSON>, to boardroom negotiating at <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, to grilling <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>. At 56, <PERSON> Liman </PERSON> declines specialties, though he is considered a brilliant trial attorney and the city's most prominent securities fraud lawyer in a decade permeated with Wall Street crime. <PERSON> Liman </PERSON> most recently was lead defense attorney in a major stock manipulation case against <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. He also represents <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s financier who expects to be indicted for fraud and racketeering. `` I am not a specialist in criminal securities fraud cases,'' <PERSON> Liman </PERSON> said in an interview during the exhausting 12-day deliberations in the <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> case, which ended March 22 in a second mistrial. `` I've always believed that a trial lawyer should be able to try any kind of case. I have avoided narrow specialization.'' A sampling of <PERSON> Liman </PERSON>'s clients over the last few years demonstrates the versatility his peers respect. On the corporate side, he represented <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> against <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 and even delivered testimony on the witness stand that helped send <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> into bankruptcy court. <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> are clients _ the two, not coincidentally, just announced a massive merger. In 1986, <PERSON> Liman </PERSON> negotiated a handshake between clients <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Tisch </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Paley </PERSON> that led to the ouster of <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s Chief Executive Officer <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyman </PERSON>. In the public domain, <PERSON> Liman </PERSON> supervised <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s disbarment and probed allegations of wrongdoing in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s medical examiner's office. His clients are n't all saints. In addition to <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and insider trader <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, <PERSON> Liman </PERSON> has represented <PERSON> Zaccaro </PERSON>, the real estate mogul and husband of former vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Vesco </PERSON>, the fugitive businessman. `` He's negotiating this case now and he could be negotitating a takeover deal tomorrow,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> lawyer and former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney who has known <PERSON> Liman </PERSON> 20 years. `` He's extremely versatile. He handles an enormous variety of cases.'' Born in <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Liman </PERSON> joined the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> law firm of <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifkind </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wharton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Garrison in 1957 after finishing first in his class at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. But he cut his teeth on white-collar crime during a 2 -LCB- - year stay at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> under <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgenthau </PERSON> starting in 1961 `` I had never worked on a securities case because there really were n't any,'' <PERSON> Liman </PERSON> said. `` We were breaking new ground.'' He recalled himself as the office `` garbage pail,'' taking small cases colleagues shunned. <PERSON> Liman </PERSON> once won a conviction of a bartender for diluting liquor but got just a $ 1 fine _ the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> judge had a bartender father. In 1971, <PERSON> Morgenthau </PERSON> appointed <PERSON> Liman </PERSON>, who had since returned to <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, as special prosecutor to investigate the <LOCATION> Attica </LOCATION> prison riots in upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. It was the first probe inside a prison, and <PERSON> Liman </PERSON>'s team interviewed every inmate. His report was nominated for a National Book Award. The <LOCATION> Attica </LOCATION> hearings were televised, but <PERSON> Liman </PERSON> said they formed an almost polar contrast to the turbulent and politically charged Iran-Contra proceedings, during which <PERSON> Liman </PERSON> received at least two serious threats for his perceived attacks on North. `` I knew the hearings were going to be televised but it never occurred to me they would become such an object of media attention,'' he said. `` Nor did I really anticipate there was going to be this wholesale stripping away of my privacy. `` All of a sudden we were receiving 100,000 hate letters and a few fan letters. ... Whenever somebody is very public in this country it brings out the crazies.'' With North now on trial in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Liman </PERSON> recalls the hearings as an exercise in unearthing evidence, not bringing anyone to justice. The philosophy of the mission, he said, quoting the late <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandeis </PERSON>, was that `` sunlight is the best disinfectant in a democracy.'' `` There are some events in American history where it's most important for the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people to understand how it happened and why it happened,'' <PERSON> Liman </PERSON> said. `` When I went down to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on the job there was a rumor a day on what happened. What people forget is these hearings dispelled so much of that. If we were n't able to find out everything that happened we were able to find out much and let the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people judge. `` I told the committee when I took the job that I could never determine for them what the real truth was _ because too many documents had been shredded and we'd have to rely on credibility.'' <PERSON> Liman </PERSON> talks to judges and juries and <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Norths </PERSON> in the same paced, deferential, just-folks manner. Facing the bench, hands in his pockets, he exposes drooping shirttails behind a tapered suit. `` I think juries do n't go for the dramatic,'' he said. `` I think they see the things and decide for themselves.'' <PERSON> Liman </PERSON> also is notoriously absentmindend. He has appeared in court in mismatched suits. One oft-repeated story has <PERSON> Liman </PERSON> asking his secretary to call a client. When she reported the man had died of a heart attack, <PERSON> Liman </PERSON> replied, `` Just have him call me when he gets in.'' Said <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON>: `` What is deceptive is <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Liman </PERSON> speaks like the guy next door. But what is driving the verbiage is a computer in his head. Even <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> came away with great respect for <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Liman </PERSON>. He was fair. He never took a cheap shot at anybody in those hearings. `` I do n't know what life holds for <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON>. Maybe someday there'll be a Democratic president If there is, I hope <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Liman </PERSON> ends up in government.''

 Sales of cars and light trucks made by the nation's Big Three automakers rose 2.3 percent in mid-March compared with a year earlier, driven by strong demand for trucks, the companies reported Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said they sold cars and light trucks at an average daily rate of 36,321 during the March 11-20 period this year, compared with 35,505 during the same time last year. Truck sales soared 7.5 percent during the period, offsetting a 0.8 percent decline in car sales. During mid-March of 1988, vehicle sales fell off a torrid pace set earlier in the year. During mid-March this year, automakers extended some buyer incentives and boosted others to reduce vehicles stockpiling on dealer lots. The companies have said that results in March and April, usually a good time for the industry, will be a test for them and the deals they offer the consumers. So far this year, car and truck sales for the Big Three averaged 32,066 vehicles a day, down 7.4 percent from the 34,617 daily average during the period last year. Car sales were down 10.7 percent and light truck sales were 1.5 percent lower as the first quarter of the year drew nearer an end. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> reported car sales rose 6.1 percent in mid-March this year, to an average daily rate of 7,185 cars compared with 6,773 last year. For the first 20 days of the month, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s car sales were down 9.3 percent and for the year, they were off 2.1 percent from the same periods last year. Truck sales by <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> ran 10.6 percent ahead of last year's rate in mid-March and 1.8 percent behind the year-to-date pace. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> said cars sold at a daily rate of 11,545 during mid-March this year, a 0.2 percent increase over the daily rate of 11,522 during the same time in 1988. So far in the month, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s cars sold at a rate 6.7 percent lower than last year's rate for the same period, and for the year, car sales were 12.7 percent lower. Light truck sales by <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> ran 5.5 percent ahead of last year's pace during mid-March and 4.3 percent behind the rate since the first of the year. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> said cars sold at a daily rate of 3,228 during mid-March this year, down 16.2 percent from the 3,850 car-a-day rate during the same time last year. Sales for the first two 10-day periods of March this year were 26.6 percent behind last year's rate, and for the year, car sales were 20.7 percent lower than in 1988. In mid-March, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s light trucks sold at a rate 6.7 percent higher than last year's rate for the same period. Year-to-date truck sales were 3.9 percent ahead of the daily sales rate during the same time last year.

 <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fields </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> shares plummeted Thursday on speculation that a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> court ruling would block <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION>'s hostile takeover attempt for the British mining giant for at least a year. The attempted buyout, valued at about $ 5.5 billion, is <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s biggest ever The 2nd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> late Wednesday upheld a lower court's preliminary injunction barring the South African-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> from buying more than 30 percent of shares in Gold Fields, which has both <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interests and American shareholders. <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>, which is controlled by the gold and diamond mining giants <ORGANIZATION> Anglo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, already owns 29.6 percent of its target. The appeals court said the proposed takeover likely would violate <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> antitrust laws. The court also ruled that the <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> bid should go back to a lower court for consideration of whether it violates <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> securities laws. The court noted that <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>, through its various holdings, `` is the largest producer of gold in the non-communist world, accounting for 20.3 percent of all gold production in the western world,'' while Gold Fields, a British firm, is the free world's second-largest gold concern Luxembourg-based <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> now can either appeal the latest ruling to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> or take the case back to the lower court for a trial on the antitrust issues. But analysts said they saw little chance the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> litigation could be resolved within the time limit allowed for the bid under British takeover rules. <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> said it was disappointed with the ruling and said it was `` reviewing the court's opinion with its advisers and studying the options available to it.'' Gold Fields shares dropped the equivalent of $ 3.15 a share to close at $ 21.50 in active trading on <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> rose 29 cents to $ 12.90 a share. Gold Fields Chairman <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON> called the ruling good news but said `` the implications for the outcome of the bid are n't yet clear.'' Under British takeover regulations, <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> ca n't extend its bid beyond April 26 and must control more than 50 percent of Gold Fields' outstanding shares by then. <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> then would have until May 17 to satisfy or waive all outstanding conditions on the bid, which offered one new <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> share plus $ 35.26 in cash for every two Gold Fields shares. One of these conditions is resolution of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> litigation, which could continue for weeks, months or years. `` What has happened is very bad news for people who were hoping for more money out of the Gold Fields issue,'' said <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Spreckley </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> CL-Alexanders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laing </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Cruickshank </PERSON>. `` Time is just not on <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>'s side. Unless legal miracles start happening -LRB- in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> -RRB-, I think this bid is bordering on dead.'' <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>'s only incentive to sweeten its offer would be if it thought it could persuade <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fields </ORGANIZATION> to accept a friendly buyout and drop the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> litigation, said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Summers </PERSON>, an analyst with the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Hoare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Govett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd </ORGANIZATION>. But, `` It's very unlikely that <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> would raise the bid,'' <PERSON> Summers </PERSON> said. `` Mr. <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON> and his board do seem to be determined to stay independent. Given some of the vitriolic remarks which have passed between the two camps ... I will be very surprised if Gold Fields would be willing to consider an offer from <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>.'' There was some speculation <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> might persuade the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers to extend the time period within which it must complete the bid until the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> court case is resolved. <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> also could clear up the litigation and make a new offer for Gold Fields sometime after February, when the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> takeover regulations would permit it to launch another bid, the analysts said. `` Anglo-American and <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> have spent many years planning their attempt on Gold Fields and I again would be surprised if they walked away from it purely because of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> court ruling,'' <PERSON> Summers </PERSON> said. `` I think <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> might be willing to take a very long-term view.''

 Corporations' after-tax profits shot up 14.6 percent in 1988, the best showing in five years, the government said Thursday in another report cited as evidence of last year's strong economic picture. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said after-tax profits rose to $ 163.8 billion last year following a 10.1 percent gain in 1987. Last year's advance was the biggest since a 22.4 percent post-recession jump in 1983 After-tax profits were up 2.8 percent in the final three months of 1988, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 173.9 billion, after advancing 3.9 percent in the third quarter. The report said increases in manufacturing profits were strongest in the chemical industry. Profits also increased in the trade, transportation and public utilities sectors. Analysts said that with the economy likely to slow this year and production and materials costs rising, the corporate profit outlook for 1989 is not as bright as it was last year. `` At this stage in the business expansion, profits are going to lose momentum,'' said economist <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` 1988 was a terrific year for the economy and for corporate profits. Profits did extremely well because of good sales and low costs. But we're past the best times in profits.'' He projected that after-tax profits this year would increase by 5 percent to 6 percent and could then decline in 1990. Among the details in the profits report: _ Before-tax profits rose 1.8 percent last quarter, to a seasonally adjusted annual level of $ 319.5 billion, after rising 2.6 percent in the third quarter _ Corporate profits, after adjusting for depreciation and inventories, rose 3 percent last quarter, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 339.9 billion, after rising 1.1 percent in the third quarter _ Corporate cash flows, a measurement intended to show the funds corporations have for investment, increased 3.2 percent last quarter, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 409.2 billion, after rising just 0.8 percent in the third quarter _ Dividend payments to stockholders rose 2.2 percent in the fourth quarter, to an annual rate of $ 108 billion, following a 2.5 percent rise in the third quarter

<HEAD>Carmaker Settles Dispute With 7 States, Will Have Safety Messages</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BREA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suzuki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said today it has agreed to put safety warnings in advertising for its four-wheel-drive Samurai to settle a dispute with the attorneys general of seven states. The company said the messages _ which warn against abrupt maneuvers in the so-called `` sport utility vehicles'' _ are to be included in all ads and promotional material. The dispute with the top law enforcement officials of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> stems from a controversy that erupted in June over a consumer group's allegation the sporty cars were likely to roll over. The attorneys general had accused the company of violating laws against false and deceptive advertising. <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> has heatedly disputed the allegations by <ORGANIZATION> Consumers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, the publisher of Consumer Reports magazine, and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in September denied a petition to order a safety recall. The agreement requires the Japanese carmaker to include in its ads the following statement: `` This vehicle handles differently from ordinary passenger cars. Federal law cautions to avoid sharp turns and abrupt maneuvers. Always wear your seat belt. For specific details, please read your owner's manual.'' The company also agreed to reimburse the states $ 200,000 for legal costs. American <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arm of the Japanese automaker, noted the company had n't acknowledged any safety problems with the cars. `` For <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> and Samurai owners, this agreement with the attorneys general is the final chapter in a long story of false allegations about the Samurai,'' <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazza </PERSON>, the company's vice president and general manager, said in a news release from American <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Brea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> offices Consumers Union tests found that because of its short wheelbase and high center of gravity, the Samurai is dangerously prone to roll over under what the consumer group maintained are normal driving conditions. <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> officials have said the car, classified for import as a `` sport utility vehicle,'' handles no differently than other four-wheel-drive cars made in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and elsewhere.

 Soybean futures prices fell sharply Thursday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in response to weaker cash markets, forecasts for weekend rains in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and perceptions of increasing supplies.

<HEAD>Trial ResultsCast Doubt On Government's Ability To Try Corruption</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A second mistrial in a key stock manipulation case and the perjury conviction of a young bond trading assistant highlight problems the government has when it takes Wall Street crime cases to court, defense lawyers said Thursday. The white-collar corruption probes that started with <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> in 1986, led to <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> and targeted <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> yielded their first criminal conviction Wednesday with the guilty verdict against 26-year-old <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. Less than 30 minutes later in the same courthouse, a federal judge declared another mistrial in the <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> stock manipulation case after the jury said it was deadlocked after 12 days of deliberations. The outcome of the two trials left defense lawyers unimpressed with the government's trumpeted efforts to bring Wall Street criminal charges to court. In the <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> case, attorneys said, the government may have overzealously pursued a defendant who was by all accounts a minor figure in the alleged scandal. And with <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION>, the government was unable to convince a jury of its case. `` In a day where you have all this Wall Street bashing, a jury was unable to decide after two weeks, and that means to me they did n't have what evidence goes with a criminal case _ harm, malevolence, evil intent,'' securities fraud lawyer <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Arkin </PERSON> said. Until now, cases derived from the insider trading scandals of the mid-1980s were settled through government plea bargains or as civil claims by the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. At least half a dozen criminal trials are scheduled for later this year. They will test the confessions of <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, the now-imprisoned arbitrager, and other financial figures who have cooperated with the government in exchange for leniency. Prosecutors based much of the <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> case, which ended in a January mistrial after the government unintentionally withheld evidence, on testimony by <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> broker and admitted felon <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON>. He said <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> asked him to illegally manipulate the price of <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> stock. Many attorneys expected the trial to turn simply on whether jurors believed Jefferies. But during deliberations, the panel asked for charts and graphs and re-heard testimony involving the often-confusing intricacies of stock trading. The <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> case also was seen as problematic because none of the accused made any money from the alleged deals. `` What it proves is the jury element is an important distinction between civil and criminal cases,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> lawyer now in private practice. `` You just never know about a jury _ whether they'll understand the case, what they'll focus on in making a decision.'' <PERSON> Said </PERSON> <PERSON> Arkin </PERSON>: `` I think whenever they try cases where nobody got hurt and they are hypertechnical cases, -LRB- prosecutors -RRB- ought to rethink it.'' Under former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, the government brought charges in more than 50 securities fraud cases starting in 1983 and made fraud prosecution a priority, increasing the complement of investigators to about 20. A handful of earlier, insider trading-related cases did go to trial, including the 1986 conviction of former <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> reporter <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> <PERSON> Winans </PERSON>, but <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> was the headline case spun off from <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Benito </PERSON> <PERSON> Romano </PERSON> said after the verdict the government intends to bring the case again and attributed the second mistrial to the vagaries of juries. Some defense lawyers agreed. `` I do n't think that means either the government can or ca n't win an insider trading case. It means that in this case nobody won so far,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldberg </PERSON>, a prosecutor under <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> from 1981-84. The <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> jury, which was sequestered March 10, issued a statement through <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> saying it would not comment on deliberations. In the <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> trial, defense lawyers harshly criticized the government's tactics, accusing prosecutors of badgering her, misleading the jury and raising red herrings about stock deals that <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> may not have understood. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> was convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice for lying to a federal grand jury in 1987 during an investigation of possibly illegal stock purchases by <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for now-defunct <ORGANIZATION> Princeton-Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LP </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> worked for <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Newberg </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> trader who faces a June trial on racketeering charges along with five <PERSON> Princeton-Newport </PERSON> partners. <PERSON> Newberg </PERSON> reported directly to <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, who is expected to be indicted for fraud and racketeering. Lawyers portrayed the prosecution of <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a one-time runaway who rose to a $ 117,000-a-year position at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, as overzealous. They claim she was treated harshly on the stand _ she broke down repeatedly _ as a message to potential future witnesses.

<HEAD>Steve Jobs's Next Inc. Switching Tactics With Businessland Deal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE WILSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Jobs </PERSON>' <ORGANIZATION> Next </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, in an abrupt switch in marketing tactics, next week will announce plans to sell its `` scholar's workstation'' through the nation's top retailer of desktop computers to business, industry sources said Thursday. Next's deal with <ORGANIZATION> Businessland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which has 112 outlets nationwide, would give Jobs' Palo Alto-based company greater visibility, speed up development of software for its workstations and deal a blow to rival <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Microsystems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, analysts said. Jobs, who called a news conference for March 30 to make `` a major business announcement,'' said last fall Next would initially sell its workstations exclusively to educators and students at a discounted price of $ 6,500 and would not venture immediately into the business market. `` That was always a smokescreen,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Lupatkin </PERSON>, analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Hambrecht </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` Anybody who is awake would realize you could n't build a big business in workstations and avoid selling to the corporate and technical market.'' The worldwide market for general purpose and technical workstations _ high-powered desktop computers that range from about $ 8,000 to $ 80,000 _ is estimated at $ 4 billion to $ 5 billion and is growing rapidly. The retail price of the Next Computer System, according to industry sources, will range from $ 10,000 to $ 12,000. Next's workstation, a sleek, black magnesium-boxed computer, which features a magneto-optical disk drive that can hold about 200,000 typewritten pages of information, is Jobs' first product since his ouster as chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in 1985. <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Microsystems </ORGANIZATION>, headquartered in <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> View </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, is the leading maker of Unix workstations for engineers and technical users and has been negotiating with <ORGANIZATION> Businessland </ORGANIZATION> and other resellers. `` Sun is out in the cold as far as <ORGANIZATION> Businessland </ORGANIZATION> is concerned,'' <PERSON> Lupatkin </PERSON> said. `` This is a step in the right direction for Next, but I do n't think it means they have arrived and will replace the leaders.'' <ORGANIZATION> Businessland </ORGANIZATION>, which declined comment on the deal, also is expected to announce it will carry new versions of <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s RT PC technical workstations that can use Next's software. `` Every workstation manufacturer is jockeying for market position,'' <PERSON> Jobs </PERSON> said in a letter announcing the news conference. `` Next believes that several non-technical factors will play key roles in determining who wins.'' Jobs said Next has been shipping its computers for almost three months, and noted that several customers and key software developers would join in the announcement next week. Jobs declined to confirm the deal with <ORGANIZATION> Businessland </ORGANIZATION> or name the software firms, but sources said he would announce development of spreadsheets, word processors and database programs by <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ashton-Tate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Claris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Initially, Next is expected to market its workstations through <ORGANIZATION> Businessland </ORGANIZATION> for scientific and engineering jobs because it already has some software for those uses. Software for business will take longer to develop. The switch from a focus on the education market to the business and technical market, however, may backfire on Next, said <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> <PERSON> Alsop </PERSON>, publisher of P.C. Letter. `` You ca n't run around for three years saying one thing and then change it overnight,'' he said. `` And educators, who until now have been Next's top priority, are very sensitive to how they rank in the eyes of their suppliers.'' Some analysts wonder whether Next, which has about 250 employees, is ready to meet the demands of selling the computer in the retail market. <PERSON> Alsop </PERSON> said selling retail would be `` fundamentally a mistake'' for Next, noting that its computer was not designed for business use and is not compatible with existing standard products. He added, though, that the computer industry is in a state of confusion, particularly in the market for machines such as Next's that use versions of <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's Unix operating system `` Next has an opportunity to walk into the Unix market and set the standard,'' <PERSON> Alsop </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The store manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> in this community on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> tells a story that gives an insight into the man considered responsible for a retailing phenomenon. Manager <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Bost </PERSON> remembers one day last summer when a secretary telephoned from <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s corporate headquarters in <LOCATION> Bentonville </LOCATION>, Ark. Chairman <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> was about to land at a nearby airport and the secretary asked if someone could fetch him and bring him to the <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Soto </PERSON> store. Paying unexpected calls on stores is one way <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> has kept in close touch with everyday goings-on. His example is followed by other <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> executives and most make a point of spending a lot of time in the field. Says <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>, district manager for 9 stores in the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> metropolitan area, `` It's not like ` uh-oh, someone's coming,' because they're always out.'' By all accounts, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON>'s personality permeates operations throughout the company. Everyone, from <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> President and Chief Operating Officer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Glass </PERSON> down to an hourly store worker, can readily quote the gospel according to <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>, as he is called. To paraphrase <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>'s primary rules of retailing; `` Rule No. 1 is the customer is always right Rule No. 2 says just in case the customer's wrong, revert to rule No. 1 If the principles sound old-fashioned and homespun, they are because that's the way <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> is, people who know him say. He shuns the limlight that his company's success has shed on him and has decided to refuse almost all press requests for interviews. He's happy to chat with folks in his stores, though. He also regularly reminds <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> `` associates'' that hospitality to customers is crucial. He preaches it in person or via high-tech satellite hookup with his stores. <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> employees became known as associates under a company effort to prove it cared about employees, partly to thwart a union organizing effort in the late 1960s. One of the most sensitive subjects for him is the fortune he's amassed A close associate says <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> would `` probably give anything'' not to be named on Fortune magazine's list of the country's wealthiest people The magazine has estimated that his immediate family's stake in <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> stock is worth about $ 6.8 billion. `` <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> is more interested in his backhand than he is in his bank account,'' says <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Shinkle </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> turns 71 on March 29. He was born in <LOCATION> Kingfisher </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION> and grew up as the son of a farm-mortgage banker. He graduated the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> with an economics degree in 1940 and joined <ORGANIZATION> J.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> as a management trainee in <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. After serving three years in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, he went to <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and opened a <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> five-and-dime store, eventually becoming the company's biggest franchisee. The seeds of the <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> empire were sown when <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> and his brother <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON>, or <PERSON> Bud </PERSON>, opened the first <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Discount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> in 1962. The rest will probably earn an entry in the history of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retail trade. <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> is a senior vice president and board member of <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION>. Three of the four grown children <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> had are involved with the company in various capacities. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> has n't slowed much, enjoying hunting and tennis as much as ever, and is said not to suffer after effects from a bout with leukemia, now in remission. He spends less time in the office since handing over most responsiblities to <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Glass </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> is still chairman of the board. Glass does n't hesitate when asked if <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> can flourish without <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>. The answer is an emphatic yes because `` We have great people,'' he says. The <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> family will always be involved, he adds. Commenting on the future, Glass says: `` We'll be judged on what we produce today. Tomorrow, what we've done in the past wo n't matter.

<HEAD>Jetta A Stable and Stalwart Car</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto and LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The 1989 <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jetta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carat </ORGANIZATION> offers admirable German handling in a small package and at a competitive price. Here is a stable, stalwart car that takes road curves with little sway. Here is a vehicle that zips along well and takes both city and highway driving in stride. Here is a compact auto with a spacious trunk and comfortable seats where the driver does n't have to feel as if he or she is sitting low inside the car. <ORGANIZATION> VW </ORGANIZATION> first brought the Jetta to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1980, and although sales have fallen from their 1986 peak of 93,000, the <PERSON> Jetta </PERSON> continues to be <ORGANIZATION> VW </ORGANIZATION>'s best seller in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Last year's sales remained about flat with 1987's 65,000 level, said company spokesman <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Amestoy </PERSON> The 1986 peak came after the Jetta was redesigned with new engine, suspension and chassis systems. Thankfully for today's buyers, the 1989 <ORGANIZATION> VW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jetta </ORGANIZATION> retains the fine characteristics of its predecessors even if it has n't made the change outside to the fancier, more aerodynamic body styling of some of the competitors -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> Accord, <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> 626 -RRB-. Today's Jetta line includes a base, two-door model which starts at $ 9,690, the upscale Carat and the performance GLI 16-valve version. The test <ORGANIZATION> Jetta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carat </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- pronounced with the accent on the last syllable, not like the vegetable -RRB- was wonderfully stable at high speeds. The 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine was mated with a five-speed automatic transmission to produce 105 horsepower at 5,400 rpm. The car cruised the highway well and seemed just as at home in city-driving maneuvers. The two front seats had nifty height adjusters that helped position me so I could easily have a clear view over the front of the car _ a position I ca n't always find in other autos. Lots of equipment came standard including rear headrests, power windows, mirrors and antenna, AM-FM stereo with cassette player and six speakers and a computer that figured fuel economy, average driving speed, etc. The only option on the test car was the $ 395 manual sunroof and that really was n't necessary since the car also had factory-installed air conditioning. However, <ORGANIZATION> VW </ORGANIZATION> is offering in 1989 for the first time antilock brakes -LRB- $ 995 -RRB-, and while the test auto did n't have them, they might be worth a good look, given their remarkable ability to help maintain vehicle control. The Jetta's trunk is one of the largest in its class, with 16.6 cubic feet of storage space. The sturdy backing under the Carat's carpet make the trunk one of the easiest to keep neat There's no sliding or bunching of the carpet. The Jetta is built for five passengers, but it could be pretty uncomfortable with three adults in the back seat. The seats are sturdy, for sure, but there could be a tight squeeze and whoever has to sit in the middle will be sitting high up on a hard spot. Legroom also could be cramped. My only other note was the difficulty I had at times in putting the car in the right gear. The floor console for the automatic transmission had raised white letters for the gears, but sometimes it was tough to tell if I was in neutral or drive, drive or second. That problem disappeared at night when the letters would light up as the car was put in gear. Jetta buyers are young, with median age of 30 and median income of $ 43,700. Nearly half are male, and 53 percent are married. The vast majority have at least some college education and 61 percent are in upper white collar jobs, <PERSON> Amestoy </PERSON> said. Main purchase reasons include value for the money, ease of handling and reliability and durability, the company said. Consumer Reports magazine says 1983-86 model Jettas ranked better than average in owner reports of trouble.

 Assets of the nation's 461 money market mutual funds rose $ 2.8 billion in the latest week, the <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. The rise to $ 299.4 billion in the seven-day period ended Wednesday, followed a $ 1.3 billion increase in the funds' assets the previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual fund trade group. It was the eleventh straight weekly all-time high for money market mutual fund assets reported by the trade group. The <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said that in the latest week, assets of 228 general purpose funds rose $ 1.3 billion to $ 97.42 billion, assets of 94 broker-dealer funds increased $ 1.08 billion to $ 129.05 billion, and assets of 139 institutional funds rose $ 449.1 million to $ 72.97 billion. `` As the yields paid by money market funds kept increasing their advantage over the yields of other financial instruments available to individual investors, assets of money market funds continued to climb,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreyer </PERSON>, vice president and chief economist at the Institute. The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in the week ended Tuesday to 8.95 percent from 8.85 percent the previous week, according to <PERSON> Donoghue </PERSON>'s Money Fund Report, a trade journal based in <LOCATION> Holliston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. The 30-day average yield rose to 8.78 percent from 8.68 percent, <PERSON> Donoghue </PERSON>'s said. The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was 31 days, down from 32 days, <PERSON> Donoghue </PERSON>'s said. Separately, the newsletter <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monitor </ORGANIZATION> said its survey of 100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual yield available on money market accounts rose to 6.53 percent as of Wednesday from 6.50 percent a week earlier. The <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super NOW accounts, fell to 5.14 percent from 5.15 percent. Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 9.05 percent on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 8.96 the previous week. Yields were 9.25 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 9.13 percent; 9.19 percent on 2 -LCB- - year CDs, up from 9.10 percent; and 9.13 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 9.09 percent

 Stock prices fell Thursday, wiping out some early gains as talk on Wall Street intensified about the possibility of a recession in the not-too-distant future. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 20.17 points to 2,243.04, extending its loss for the week to 49.10 points. Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 7 to 5 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 584 up, 814 down and 567 unchanged.

Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 181.25 million shares. Activity was subdued on the eve of a long holiday weekend. The markets will be closed for Good Friday.

 Energy futures prices spurted Thursday, driven by a rally in the gasoline pits inspired by speculation the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> will endorse new restrictions affecting refining in the Northeast. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the April contract for unleaded gasoline rose 0.66 cent to 58.02 cents a gallon after posting a 0.21-cent increase on Wednesday.

Gasoline buying was triggered by news reports that the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> was likely to approve pending applications seeking to lessen pollution-causing emissions from gasoline sold in Northeastern states to cut smog in the region, he said. Energy market analysts say the restrictions will make the refining process more costly and complicated and could lead to temporary shortages as refiners in the Northeast make alterations to accomodate tighter rules. Speculation about how the proposed rules will affect gasoline supplies is expected to dominate the gasoline pits in the near future. `` Next week's going to be very critical for the gasoline market,'' <PERSON> Lebow </PERSON> said. `` There's potential for very explosive movement on the up side.

 The dollar finished higher in uneventful domestic trading Thursday after putting in a mixed performance overseas ahead of the long Easter weekend. Gold prices were mostly lower. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said gold was bid at $ 392.00 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, down $ 1.40 from Wednesday's late bid. Traders said the dollar held in a narrow range as they squared their positions before the holiday weekend. `` It was fairly quiet,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` There was no determination to push the dollar in either direction.''

<HEAD>Platinum, Silver Futures Plunge In Thin Markets As Dollar Gains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Platinum and silver futures prices fell sharply Thursday as the dollar gained strength but analysts said the metal tumble resulted mainly from thin market conditions as traders got an early start on the long Easter weekend. Thin trading conditions also were mentioned by traders as a reason for a rally in the orange juice futures market. On other markets, sugar futures continued a slide begun on Wednesday, soybeans were lower while grains were mixed; energy futures advanced; and livestock and meat futures were mixed. The nation's commodity and financial markets will be closed on Friday. Platinum futures settled $ 9.20 to $ 9.50 lower on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> with the contract for delivery in April at $ 537.40 a troy ounce. On <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, gold settled $ 1.60 to $ 2.20 lower with April at $ 393.40 a troy ounce; silver was 5.5 cents to 6.6 cents lower with May at $ 6.058 a troy ounce. The precious metals remained within their well-worn trading ranges and analysts said the sharp downward moves in platinum and silver were not linked to any significant change in market fundamentals. But with many overseas markets closed, the number of market participants was unusually small, which typically increases volatility. Precious-metal values generally move in the opposite direction from the dollar. So when the dollar began gaining strength against other currencies, `` that put downside pressure on the precious metals and because of the thin market conditions, it drove the metals lower than they normally would have gone under this scenario,'' said <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Raptopoulos </PERSON>, a metals-market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Most frozen concentrated orange juice futures leaped the permitted 5-cents-a-pound limit for daily trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> amid unconfirmed rumors of possible price increases by <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> processors. The contract for May delivery, which has no limit, soared 6 cents to $ 1.5595 a pound. But analysts said the rally was exaggerated by thin market conditions. `` We're looking at a forecast for Brazilian output to increase sharply next year and I just do n't see any real supply concerns,'' said analyst <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ganes </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Sugar futures fell sharply on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on continued speculative selling following Wednesday's statement by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> that it had completed its sugar-buying program for 1989 Sugar settled .37 cent to .52 cent lower with May at 11.11 cents a pound. Soybean futures prices fell on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in response to weaker cash markets, forecasts for weekend rains in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and perceptions of increasing supplies. Some of the selling was prompted by forecasts for rain in parts of the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> late in the weekend or early next week, which could reduce lingering dryness from last summer's drought. Perceptions that newly harvested Brazilian soybeans are about to reach the market added to the selling pressure. Wheat settled unchanged to 2 cents higher with May at $ 4.28 \ a bushel; corn was 1 -LCB- cents to 2 -RCB- cents lower with May at $ 2.77 -RCB- a bushel; oats were 2 -RCB- cents to 3 \ cents lower with May at $ 2.05 \ a bushel; soybeans were 6 -LCB- cents to 9 -LCB- cents lower with May at $ 7.84 -LCB- Energy futures advanced moderately on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>. The May crude-oil contract surged to $ 20.24 a barrel, where it encountered strong resistance and retreated into the close. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 8 cents to 12 cents higher with May at $ 20.15 a barrel; heating oil was .19 cent to .52 cent higher with April at 56.52 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .20 cent to .99 cent higher with April at 58.02 cents a gallon. Livestock and meat futures finished mixed in pre-weekend position-evening on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle settled .20 cent lower to .37 cent higher with April at 78.20 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent lower to .33 cent higher with April at 81.02 cents a pound; hogs were .45 cent lower to .15 cent higher with April at 42.70 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .23 cent lower to .60 cent higher with May at 38.15 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Attorneys General: Suzuki Agrees to Include Warning in Samurai Ads</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suzuki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to pay $ 200,000 to seven states and to include in future advertisements a warning that its Samurai sport vehicle may roll over if turned too sharply. The agreement announced Thursday settles lawsuits filed by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> accusing the car manufacturer _ the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arm of Japanese automaker <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> _ of false and deceptive advertising. It was effective Tuesday. American <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON>, based in <LOCATION> Brea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, entered the agreement without admitting any guilt or safety problems. The $ 200,000 is to cover the states' costs in preparing the cases. The states began investigating the Samurai's safety last June after Consumer Reports magazine gave the popular, four-wheel-drive sport utility vehicle its first `` not acceptable'' rating in 10 years. Consumers Union, publisher of Consumer Reports, said the $ 8,500 Samurai is too short, too narrow, too light and its center of gravity is too high to be safe. It was the first car of 349 tested in the last decade to roll over during a routine accident-avoidance test, in which cars are made to swerve to avoid an obstacle in the road, the group reported. `` This agreement strongly affirms that the Samurai is a safe vehicle and strongly supports the federal government decision that there is no reason to investigate the safety of the Samurai,'' <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazza </PERSON>, <PERSON> American </PERSON> <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON>'s vice president, said in a statement. Consumers Union, of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vernon </LOCATION>, had asked the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to recall the more than 150,000 Japanese-built Samurais sold in this country since its introduction in November 1985. The agency denied the recall petition in September, saying the Samurai had a rollover rate `` within the range of most other light utility vehicles.'' It also said most rollovers were influenced by `` drinking, low ambient light and lack or driver familiarity -LRB- with -RRB- either the vehicle or the road.'' <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Attorney general <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said Thursday that the states took action because `` the federal government has, once again, failed to act to protect the consumers of this country.'' Samurai print ads now must include the following statement: `` This vehicle handles differently from ordinary passenger cars. Federal law cautions to avoid sharp turns and abrupt maneuvers which can cause vehicles of this type to roll over. Always wear your seatbelt. For specific details, please read your owner's manual.'' A shorter version of the statement is required for television and radio ads, <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said his investigation indicated previous <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> ads `` deceived the public by promoting the Samurai as a safe, fun passenger vehicle while knowing it ... can present considerable dangers to young, inexperienced, first-time purchasers who were <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON>'s target buyers.'' <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> contended its advertising did not violate state laws but decided to agree to a settlement to avoid possible legal action by the states. `` For <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> and Samurai owners, this agreement with the attorneys general is the final chapter in a long story of false allegations about the Samurai,'' <PERSON> Mazza </PERSON> said.

 It's a sobering time for the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> oil industry. Although business is good again after a deep slump, experts say relatively weak oil prices and the <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> oil rig disaster last July have forced underwater drillers to change the way they do business. Once concerned about producing oil quickly, the industry now is more worried about restraining costs, and that has meant many lost jobs, experts said. The rig disaster, a fire that killed 167 men, halted a considerable amount of production _ 300,000 barrels a day for about six months _ and increased safety concerns. The industry has attracted many competitors with its 22 percent success rate in finding oil despite the technological problems associated with underwater drilling. The rivalry has squeezed profits and encouraged takeovers, leaving a smaller number of companies. The most notable takeover was <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 4.4 billion acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Britoil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> early last year Adding to concerns is an awareness that the oil wo n't last forever and <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s sector of the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> is expected to surpass British production in a few years. Some companies have moved to protect themselves by getting more heavily into gas exploration and production, selling their expertise abroad and broadening into defense and other non-oil areas. `` It's a different business we're in,'' said <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, a Scottish oil-services company. `` The super-boom is gone. The' 86 -'87 downturn was The emphasis now is on cost.'' <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is the non-communist world's sixth largest oil producer after <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, figures compiled by the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scotland </ORGANIZATION> show. Thirty-six fields produced about 2.41 million barrels a day last year, down 7.5 percent from the 1985 peak of 2.59 million barrels a day. Production is expected to decline to 2.22 million barrels a day this year, 2 million by 1995, and expire in 30 to 50 years. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> oil was first produced in significant amounts in 1976. It is <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>'s largest single industry with 54,000 workers, down 18 percent from 1985 but 6 percent higher than during the slump, the bank said. `` Currently, I think business is very, very good,'' said <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Marnoch </PERSON>, chief executive of the <ORGANIZATION> Aberdeen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. Oil prices plummeted from $ 30 a barrel to $ 10 a barrel in early 1986, and have recovered to about $ 19. `` The oil price shock came as quite a devastating blow in the industry,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, an economist at the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. `` Since then companies have moved on to a new expectation about oil prices and the potential of the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> and have acted accordingly.'' Recently, the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> has curbed production to bolster prices, and independent producing countries have announced they are trimming exports. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> belongs neither to <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> nor the independent group, but <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> oil production is vulnerable to <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s erratic behavior. The <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> oil industry has cut costs by reducing manpower, upgrading technology and undertaking smaller projects, <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said. Still, it's more expensive to produce oil in the poor <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> conditions, $ 3 to $ 15 a barrel, vs. less than $ 1 a barrel in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said. Despite declining production and weak prices, experts said oil exploration remains healthy. Industry enthusiasm was reflected in good demand for exploration leases in the government's recent sale. Last year was a record year for drilling, with 21 new fields begun, said <PERSON> Angus </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicolson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Scottish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> official. `` Ultimately we are looking at finite resources,'' said <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>, deputy managing director of <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> U.K. Exploration and Production. `` The challenge now is to find the smaller and smaller amounts and produce them cleverly.'' Even after cutting costs, however, it's difficult to make a profit, the experts said. `` There are the usual complaints that the margins are thin,'' <PERSON> Marnoch </PERSON> said. Indeed, <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> conceded that his company's net income has eroded, but he declined to elaborate. The Piper Alpha rig, operated by <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, was owned by <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> and other oil companies, and <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> was not directly involved in the disaster. But upgrading safety has increased its costs, <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> said. A public inquiry into the disaster might result in recommendations for costly safety measures. For example, the government already has asked the industry to comment on the possibility of requiring all operators to install emergency shutdown valves. End adv for Sunday, March 26

 The bond market rose modestly Thursday, extending the gradual recovery of the previous two sessions in quiet pre-holiday trading. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s bellwether 30-year bond rose 3-16 point, or $ 1.88 per $ 1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves inversely to its price, fell to 9.21 percent from 9.23 percent late Wednesday. Trading trailed off by midafternoon as dealers went home early for a three-day Easter holiday. There is no bond trading on Good Friday. In contrast to earlier in the week, there was no economic news to move the market. Traders shrugged off as old news the government's report that the economy expanded at a 2.4 percent annual rate in the last three months of 1988 `` It was very thin today. There's nothing that anybody can grab on here,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Estes </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. In the secondary market for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds, prices of short-term governments rose 1-32 point, intermediate issues were up 1-32 point to 1-16 point and long-term maturities rose 3-32 point to 3-16 point, according to <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the financial information service. The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $ 10 in the price of a bond with a $ 1,000 face value. The <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Bond Index, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, rose 0.67 to 1,113.98. In corporate trading, industrials were up. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, rose 0.34 to 295.70. In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds rose \ point to 89 -LCB-. The average yield to maturity fell to 7.84 percent from 7.87 percent late Wednesday. Yields on three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills were unchanged at 9.35 percent as the discount remained at 9.02 percent. Yields on six-month bills rose to 9.55 percent as the discount rose 1 basis point to 9.00 percent. Yields on one-year bills fell to 9.67 percent as the discount fell 1 basis point to 8.91 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the annualized return on an investment in a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bill. The discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at maturity.

<TEXT>
 Two Japanese players revving up for entry into the crowded field of $ 20,000 to $ 40,000 luxury cars in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are on a collision course with European makers for a share of the growing upscale segment. As a result, auto industry analysts predict some foreign competitors could get severely bruised in of one the most lucrative markets in the world. `` Neutral country attacks <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' says an advertising campaign recently started by <ORGANIZATION> Saab-Scania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, fighting to keep the Swedish automaker's spot in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Peugeot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, with its roots in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, also is cranking up a new campaign and has offered dealers incentives they can pass to customers. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Sterling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cars </ORGANIZATION> meanwhile is restructuring its entire <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marketing, service and parts plan to slow a sales skid. `` What we are seeing happen is that a lot of the European manufacturers who have taken their niche for granted have realized all of a sudden that it's not a guarantee,'' said auto-industry analyst <PERSON> Jeannette </PERSON> <PERSON> Garretty </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` The prevailing attitude has been is that there is a <ORGANIZATION> Saab </ORGANIZATION> buyer, a Mercedes buyer who will always be there.'' That's been changing. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sales for 14 European-made cars last year were 16.4 percent behind 1987 levels, led by <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION>'s 44.7 percent tumble and Sterling's sales dip of 37.9 percent During the same time, sales of all imported cars dropped 4 percent. European cars made up 5.5 percent of the entire <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> car market in 1988, down from 6.8 percent the year before. The fiercest competition promises to be among the expensive, relatively low-volume European imports, including <ORGANIZATION> Saab </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Peugeot </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Sterling </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> BMW </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Volvo </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION>. Some analysts wonder how those companies will fare in the scrap over the market pie. `` We have dealers saying this is the most competitive time they've ever faced,'' said <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirton </PERSON>, director of marketing for <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` They often say that, but this time I believe them.'' Besides watching each other, European makers are scrutinizing the latest wave in the Japanese invasion of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> car market _ <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION>'s Lexus and <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION>'s Infiniti luxury car divisions. Each of the Japanese automakers plan to begin selling two models this fall. The Lexus cars are expected to cost between $ 20,000 and $ 35,000. Infiniti's prices will range from $ 25,000 to around $ 40,000. That wedges them into the market now divvied up by <ORGANIZATION> Volvo </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Saab </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Peugeot </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> BMW </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Sterling </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION>. The Japanese makers have said their target with Infiniti and Lexus principally is the European competition, not the few <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> entries from <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Cadillac </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln-Mercury </ORGANIZATION> divisions. `` I think they will get off to a pretty good start,'' said auto analyst <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Healy </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` The names of the companies are known. These guys have deep pockets and a lot of patience. `` I think we can count on the fact that it will be a pretty good product,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Saab </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON>, disagrees. `` The Japanese are moving upscale and that's a very significant move,'' he said. `` They're reliable but they're bland and look basically alike.'' <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s move into the luxury import segment, challenging the Europeans, began in March 1986 with <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>'s Acura division. In 1988, sales for the division rose 16.5 percent over the year before. By volume, <ORGANIZATION> Acura </ORGANIZATION> sold more cars last year than did all European imports except <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION>. Division spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> is counting on Acura's sales to increase 15 percent to 20 percent this model year. Automakers and analysts predict the luxury-performance segment of the car market will grow during the next year, partly reflecting the financial success of the baby-boom generation. Nonetheless, there's still concern whether it will grow enough for everybody to survive `` We're really fortunate we've had a 3 -LCB- - year head start in that segment,'' <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> said <PERSON> Acura </PERSON> will remain strong in the market, <PERSON> Garretty </PERSON> said, because of established reputation. It's priced lower than most of the Europeans and what's expected for Lexus and Infiniti. Acura's prices are more in line with <ORGANIZATION> Saab </ORGANIZATION>'s. `` They -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Saab </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- do have reason to be concerned,'' said analyst <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Heaney </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> `` Saab is more of a cult following. People either love it or hate it,'' she added. `` Saab is one of those companies which is stuck in no man's land.'' <PERSON> Healy </PERSON> agreed, and wondered about the future of <ORGANIZATION> Saab </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Peugeot </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Peugeot </ORGANIZATION> has a much smaller <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presence than <ORGANIZATION> Saab </ORGANIZATION> _ selling about two-thirds as many cars last year _ but its European automobile operations are stronger, <PERSON> Healy </PERSON> said. So, <ORGANIZATION> Saab </ORGANIZATION> has decided to take off the gloves in its advertising in an attempt to make its name better known in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` I think it's the old story about the farmer with the mule. First you have to get its attention,'' <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON> said. `` We thought we should throw bombs and hand grenades to get their attention.''

<HEAD>Government: GAF Jury Favored Conviction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>With AM-Wall Street Crime, Bjt ^By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government claimed Thursday that defense lawyers said most jurors in the <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> criminal stock manipulation case favored conviction when a judge declared a mistrial because the panel was deadlocked. Defense attorneys immediately denied the claim attributed to them. The <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> case drew wide attention as the first criminal trial arising from the confessions of imprisoned insider trader <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>. It was the second mistrial in the case and suggested prosecutors can not easily win convictions, but the government asked Thursday for a third trial starting next month. It was n't clear when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> would set a new trial date for <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> and Vice Chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON>. `` As we understand it, most jurors felt beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> is guilty and we're confident that they all will next time,'' said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Baird </PERSON>, who heads the securities and commodities fraud division. `` We actually were told about the split by defense lawyers,'' he said. `` We were told that is what they learned.'' But attorneys for <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION>, a <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON>, N.J.-based specialty chemicals maker, said they had not spoken to jurors or indicated to prosectuors which way the jury was leaning. `` No one from the defense made that statement to my knowledge because there would be no basis to make that statement,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON>, an attorney for <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON>. `` It's speculation. It's surmise without any proof,'' he said. `` There is no public information and the jury issued a communication that they do n't want to discuss the matter.'' The jury said in a statement through <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> they would not comment on their more than 90 hours of deliberations that followed the six-week trial. Jurors reached by telephone Thursday stuck to their pledge. The panel reported last Saturday it was deadlocked 11-1 but did not indicate whether the majority favored acquittal or conviction. On Wednesday it reported a three way split _ some to acquit, some to convict and others undecided. The judge then asked whether further deliberations would be fruitful. Seven said no, five said yes and <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> decreed the mistrial. `` The original deadlock note of 11 to 1 did not indicate what the sentiments of the jury were,'' said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, an attorney for <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON>. `` They only thing that can be said for the next note is that it appears there was some kind of a shift.'' `` But I think it's still not possible to tell what the sentiments were Saturday night or -LRB- Wednesday -RRB- afternoon,'' he said. After the 11-1 note, the defense asked <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> to declare a mistrial several times as the tiring deliberations progressed. <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> also declared a mistrial in January after ruling that the government unintentionally withheld evidence. At that time, jurors on the first panel said they could not have convicted <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> based on the testimony. <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION>, two subsidiaries and <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> were charged last year with allegedly trying to boost the stock price of <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 shortly before selling a large block of shares. They also were charged with securities fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy. The purpose of the alleged deal was to maximize <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION>'s profits from the planned sale of a large block of <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> stock after a failed takeover of the much larger chemical concern. The second mistrial was perceived as a setback in the government's efforts to stage criminal trials in a Wall Street fraud investigation that began with the insider trading scandals of the mid-1980s. `` It's always disappointing when all 12 jurors do n't accept the government's case,'' <PERSON> Baird </PERSON> said. `` As long as we're confident in the strength of our cases and confident that most jurors saw the case as the government saw it, we'll try it again.''

<HEAD>Takeover Target Polaroid Protects Itself Through ESOP, Other Maneuvers</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Rewrites throughout to update with Shamrock selling Polaroid
stake in buyback.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 If you think corporate takeover battles are like the <LOCATION> Wild </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, you might say <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> circled the wagons to repel a $ 3.2 billion assault from investor <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Disney </PERSON>. After Disney's <ORGANIZATION> Shamrock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> announced its bid eight months ago, <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> methodically placed stock in friendly hands in preparation for its annual meeting, using an employee stock ownership plan, a share repurchase program and the sale of shares to a sympathetic third party. <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s moves were upheld by <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> state courts and this past week <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> said it was selling its 4.96 million Polaroid shares back to the instant photography pioneer under the repurchase plan. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> group would not say whether it was abandoning its bid. `` It seems to have worked,'' said <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON>, an analyst who follows <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of the strategy designed to garner enough support to prevent <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> from unseating <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s board at the annual meeting. An estimated one-third of <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s voting stock is held by company allies, making it difficult for <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> to win the majority it would need in a shareholder proxy fight. Moreover, the Polaroid strategy likely ensures that <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> would fail through a tender offer to shareholders. Under state law in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> _ where <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> is incorporated _ a suitor would have to acquire 85 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s stock or wait three years to complete the merger. <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s strategy has intrigued observers. `` Other companies that are incorporated in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> are going to look extremely carefully at the actions <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> has taken as a guideline for how to defend yourself against an unfriendly acquirer,'' <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON> said. In upholding <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s moves, the <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> disagreed with <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>'s contention that the employee stock ownership plan, $ 1.1 billion stock buyback and sale of $ 300 million in preferred shares to <ORGANIZATION> Corporate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LP </ORGANIZATION> were intended primarily as takeover defenses. Despite that ruling, the fact remains that these steps constitute a powerful shield against a hostile bid. Most employee stock ownership plans, or ESOPs, are n't created as takeover defenses, but as a way for companies to raise cash. They also are useful when a company is acquired by employees; <ORGANIZATION> Avis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> was taken private through an <ORGANIZATION> ESOP </ORGANIZATION> in 1987. Many companies like them. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ownership </ORGANIZATION>, a research organiation, estimates there are 9,500 ESOPs covering nearly 10 million workers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Lawyer <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Lang </PERSON>, who has drafted ESOPs, says stock ownership `` tends to keep your employees interested in the profitability and productivity of the company and interested in the stock price.'' But when <ORGANIZATION> J.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> created a $ 700 million <ORGANIZATION> ESOP </ORGANIZATION> last summer and <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> upped its employees' stake to 20 percent from 14 percent earlier this year, analysts said these were defensive steps Analysts made the same judgment when <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> unveiled its <ORGANIZATION> ESOP </ORGANIZATION> on July 12, 1988. The company had already received overtures from <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>, although the <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> group did not announce its bid publicly for another eight days. ESOPs bind workers closer to their employers, and managers fighting a takeover battle expect employees to stand with them when the workers vote their stock at a shareholders meeting. `` The theory is the employees always vote along with management and their jobs,'' said <PERSON> Lang </PERSON>, noting that workers fear layoffs in a hostile takeover. There's little doubt how <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> employees would vote. They signed petitions and held demonstrations against a <LOCATION> Shamrock </LOCATION> takeover. But in the course of the Polaroid-Shamrock battle, a possible wrinkle emerged in ESOPs that could complicate their use as a takeover defense: There's no guarantee that all the stock in a plan will be voted according to employees' wishes. Under <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> ESOP </ORGANIZATION>, a trustee votes the shares held by individual employees according to their instructions. Shares issued to the plan but not held by individual employees _ known as unallocated shares _ are to be voted in the same proportion as allocated shares, reflecting the employees' sentiment. The problem is with the unallocated shares. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> _ which has jurisdiction over ESOPs under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act _ told the trustee of the <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> ESOP </ORGANIZATION>, Citizens and <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, it was not bound by the plan's provisions, and could decide for itself how to vote the unallocated shares. The letter was not binding on the trustee. However, noted attorney <PERSON> Lang </PERSON>, `` an expert agency is usually given high credence when they interpret their own statutes,'' and the letter could be given weight in a court decision. But <PERSON> Corey </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ownership </ORGANIZATION>, doubted that if the department's stand were tested in court and upheld it could survive the subsequent public outcry. `` It would be a situation where employees are forced to sell a company they do n't want to,'' he said. <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was looking at the employees as shareholders seeking the maximum value for their stock instead of workers concerned about their jobs. Citizens and Southern refused to discuss the issue or how it might vote the unallocated shares, which account for 90 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> ESOP </ORGANIZATION>. The entire plan holds nearly 14 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s stock But Polaroid was n't relying solely on its employees for support _ it was certain to have the votes of <ORGANIZATION> Corporate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, a partnership formed to help companies block hostile takeover attempts. Polaroid is paying as much as 11 percent annual dividends to <ORGANIZATION> Corporate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, and placed two members of the partnership on its board. Selling stock to a `` white sheik'' _ a party who will support a company against a hostile suitor _ is not new. But some companies have learned the hard way that the ploy can have undesirable repercusssions. In 1984, <ORGANIZATION> Chris-Craft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> helped <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> avoid an unwanted bid from publisher <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> by becoming <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s largest stockholder. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> has had reason to regret the move _ he and <ORGANIZATION> Chris-Craft </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> have been bickering ever since. The third part of <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s defense, the stock buyback, has been used by many companies seeking to protect themselves even if they're not facing a takeover threat by having fewer vulnerable shares on the market <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ryder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Borden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> are among companies that recently have repurchased stock. In the fall of 1987, retailer <ORGANIZATION> Dayton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hudson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> was the target of a hostile bid from <ORGANIZATION> Dart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Then on Oct. 19, the stock market collapsed, taking with it <PERSON> Dart </PERSON>'s bid <PERSON> Dayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> wasted no time. It immediately started buying back 15 million shares.

<TEXT>
 Changes in the two broadest measures of the nation's money supply were mixed in the week ended March 13, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said the measure known as M2 fell to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,078.1 billion from $ 3,083.4 billion the previous week. An even broader measure, M3, rose to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,951.1 billion from $ 3,948.1 billion. The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell to a seasonally adjusted $ 784 billion from $ 791.5 billion. M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations of $ 100,000. In judging its monetary policy, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has indicated it is monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the difference between short - and long-term interest rates It also has shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply measures. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> in February reaffirmed a provisional target for 1989 of 3 percent to 7 percent growth in M2 and 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent growth in M3. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has not set a target for M1 growth since early 1987. For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $ 3,069.8 billion, a 2.7 percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 13 weeks. M3 averaged $ 3,928.1 billion, up 4.1 percent, while M1 rose 0.6 percent to an average of $ 787.5 billion. In other reports: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> reported commercial and industrial loans at major <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> banks rose $ 525 million to $ 57.56 billion _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said bank borrowings from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> at the discount window averaged $ 385 million a day, down from $ 459 million _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said net free reserves totaled $ 383 million, down from $ 402 million a week earlier _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> reported that the monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank reserves held at <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation, was $ 289.7 billion in the two-week period ended Wednesday, up from $ 287.7 billion two weeks earlier

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> moved against its striking pilots on two fronts Thursday, asking a federal appeals court to force them back to work while announcing that the company will begin to train replacements soon. A three-judge panel of the 11th <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION> took <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s appeal under advisement after an hour-long hearing. Eastern asked the judges to overturn a lower court ruling permitting the pilots to honor striking Machinists' picket lines under the Railway Labor Act `` The question is whether the <ORGANIZATION> RLA </ORGANIZATION> expressly forbids a sympathy strike,'' said Judge <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lanier </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. `` That is the issue before us.'' In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Thursday, federal Bankruptcy Court Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> said he would appoint an examiner to oversee <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> during its reorganization under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy laws. In a move described as unusual by bankruptcy attorneys, <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> said the as-yet-unnamed examiner would be given the power to try to mediate between <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and its creditors and employees, as well as gather information. In the federal appeals court, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> told the judges that because the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> was negotiating a new contract with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, they could not strike for any reason. `` The Railway Labor Act says you can not strike in support of your collective bargaining goals until you have exhausted all of the procedures of that act, and there is no dispute those procedures have not been exhausted,'' he told reporters afterward. But <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindsey </PERSON>, who represented <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION>, argued that the pilots have the right to stage a sympathy strike and that the federal courts do n't have the authority to define what a sympathy strike is. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> took that right away from the judicial branch in 1932, <PERSON> Lindsey </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lindsey </PERSON> said he thought the judges might rule sometime next week. In <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said that despite <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION>'s contention the carrier could not find qualified pilots to replace strikers, training for the first group of replacements was about to start `` We're hiring, no question about it,'' <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said. `` The first class starts on Monday, and that will have 30 or 40 people in it. These are people who have been interviewed and passed the examination.'' In addition, he said, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> has received `` into the thousands of phone calls'' in response to its ads seeking new pilots, which began running Sunday. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> pilots, dismissed the hirings as unimportant, saying many pilots meet <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> requirements but are n't ready to work at a commercial airline. `` This is a situation that the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> is going to have to keep a close eye on,'' he said. Eastern has been getting about 115 flights a day aloft recently, said another spokewoman, <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON>, and the new pilots will increase that number. Before the strike, the company had more than 1,000 flights a day. After the bankruptcy court hearing in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, both <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and the pilots union said they agreed with the judge's decision to appoint an examiner with power to act as a mediator. Eastern had asked <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> to appoint an examiner to review all transactions between <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and affiliated airlines during bankruptcy proceedings. The unions have asked the bankruptcy court to appoint a trustee, a more powerful official who actually would run the airline during its bankruptcy reorganization. <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> indicated his appointment of an examiner did not necessarily mean he would not consider naming a trustee later. He said he would ask the examiner to take on more than just fact-finding duties in the hopes the examiner could `` mediate differences'' between the embattled company and its unions and other creditors. `` It sounds like a trustee, not an examiner,'' said <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> <PERSON> Kupersmith </PERSON>, chief financial adviser to the pilots' union. But Eastern President <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakes </PERSON> also expressed no problems with the judge's decision, saying, `` We wish we had thought of it.''

<HEAD>Ecuador To Renew Payments of Foreign Debt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>QUITO, Ecuador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government said Thursday it will soon renew payments on <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>'s $ 11 billion foreign debt after a more than two-year suspension. `` Within the process of negotiations with private foreign banks and after a 26-month suspension of interest payments, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> will make modest and partial installments this year,'' government spokesman <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> declined to give further details. But the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> said payments are expected to be resumed in the coming weeks. The small Andean country has balked at repayments since the start of a financial crisis incited by a major earthquake in March 1987, which ruptured a key oil pipeline and paralyzed the petroleum export industry for six months until line could be repaired. During the year previous, the economy suffered by drastically declining world oil prices. <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> depends on oil sales for more than 60 percent of its foreign exchange. President <PERSON> Rodrigo </PERSON> <PERSON> Borja </PERSON> called for renegotiations with foreign creditors shortly after he took office in August 1988, and talks began earlier this year. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has allotted $ 500 million for debt payments in this year's budget.

 The handful of companies involved in nuclear fusion research are n't expecting any profit windfall as a result of an advance claimed Thursday by researchers in <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Fusion plants built by private industry will some day provide clean, safe and inexpensive power, but in spite of the announcement that day remains several decades off, company officials said in interviews. Two researchers said Thursday they produced controlled nuclear fusion using high school-level chemistry that could lead to a technology capable of driving electrical generators within a few years. <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southhampton </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> cautioned that more research is needed to determine whether the process will work on a large scale. Officials in the tiny private sector of the nuclear fusion business said they wanted to learn more about the work, but that even in the best of circumstances it would only be a first step. `` We thought that during the 1980s fusion would be going into engineering development that would require the private sector. That would have happened, but the energy crisis went away'' and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration cut spending, said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> O </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Fusion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Gaithersburg </LOCATION>, Md. Fusion Power Associates was formed in 1979 as a group of private companies and organizations involved in fusion work. `` We've sort of been in a holding pattern waiting for better times in terms of government policies,'' <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> said. `` We need a commitment to engineering development. We do n't see how that can be done in private industry.'' Only two companies are gathering substantial revenue from nuclear fusion, and in both cases the money comes entirely from government funding, he said. General Atomics, a privately held company in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, has a $ 30 million-a-year contract to operate an experimental magnetic-confinement fusion device. It has other government contracts worth $ 5 million to $ 6 million a year. <ORGANIZATION> KMS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fusion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbor </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, makes fuel capsules that are used as the targets of experimental laser-confinement fusion reactors. The company is the only private company receiving <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> funding for laser fusion research. Its funding is less than <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atomics </ORGANIZATION>', <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Centaur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> ended its months-long hostile takeover attempt of <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Thursday, announcing it was dropping its $ 110-per-share offer The withdrawal comes three days after the chemical company announced it will accept a $ 132-per-share offer from the French government-controlled oil and chemical concern <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aquitaine </ORGANIZATION>. Based on the number of <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION>'s outstanding shares _ 8 million _ <ORGANIZATION> Elf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aquitaine </ORGANIZATION>'s offer amounts to more than $ 1 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Centaur </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement coincided with <PERSON> Elf </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquitaine </PERSON>'s formal commencement of the offer. Centaur, which owns about 13 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION>'s stock, dropped the offer because of the <ORGANIZATION> Elf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aquitaine </ORGANIZATION> development, the New York-based investment group said in a statement. No officials were available Thursday evening to comment on the decision, said <ORGANIZATION> Centaur </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> had fought Centaur since the investment group first made its plans known last June. During the fight, <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> sold off a pharmaceutical division and most of its equipment business. The company also went to court to stop Centaur from calling a shareholders meeting, where the investment group hoped to replace the directors, paving the way for the takeover bid to succeed. <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuttle </PERSON>, maintained throughout the takeover bid that the company believed Centaur never actually wanted to acquire the company but merely wanted to drive up the stock prices. Centaur does, indeed, stand to make a profit. The investment group, headed by <PERSON> Abbey </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrin </PERSON>, began buying <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> stock in June when the price was $ 65 a share. It is estimated that <ORGANIZATION> Centaur </ORGANIZATION>'s stock will bring the investors more than $ 60 million. `` I ca n't imagine -LRB- Centaur's principals -RRB- are too upset,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Pattison </PERSON>, an analyst with <PERSON> C.J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> <PERSON> Grenfell </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Even if they were sincere about wanting to run the company, a profit like that can certainly soften the disappointment.'' <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinard </PERSON> could not be reached for comment, but <ORGANIZATION> Elf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aquitaine </ORGANIZATION>'s spokesman <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> said, `` There's not much to comment on. This does n't change <PERSON> Elf </PERSON>'s position.'' <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION>'s stock closed unchanged at $ 130.25 Thursday in consolidated <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. The stock's price jumped $ 13.12 -LCB- _ about 11 percent _ to $ 130.12 -LCB- when <PERSON> Elf </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquitaine </PERSON>'s offer was made public Monday

 <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> students and unions supporting the striking machinists at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday called on the college to withdraw a top alumni award to <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, chairman of the embattled airline. Some 300 students and supporters of the striking airline employees chanted `` Union busting is disgusting,'' as they gathered in front of <LOCATION> Low </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Library </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> campus, where <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> and five other prominent alumni were to have received the <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Award </PERSON> at a dinner Thursday night. The college, an undergraduate school at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, scrapped plans for the annual dinner last week because, according to a statement, the atmosphere would have been marred by `` the current emotional climate in the labor dispute between <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and its machinists' union.'' <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Knubel </PERSON>, a college spokesman, when asked Thursday if the school would withdraw <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s award, pointed to a sentence in last Friday's statement, which read: `` The board of directors of the <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alumni </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> will decide on -LRB- its -RRB- next steps at its fall meeting.'' The <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Award </PERSON> is given to prominent alumni for their achievements and service to the college. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashby </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Airline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, told the protesters, `` We are here tonight because we are outraged that the president and board of trustees of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> have chosen to honor <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> at a time when he is destroying <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and the lives of its 30,000 employees.'' <PERSON> Knubel </PERSON> said the college would have no comment on the rally and the petition.

 <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> directors have rejected the latest buyout offer from rival poultry processor <ORGANIZATION> Tyson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, saying there is no way to ensure the $ 1.18 billion bid was sound, <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. Wednesday's rejection of the $ 63.50-a-share offer came the same day that a <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> gave <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> permission to ask its shareholders on April 14 to approve a friendly merger with <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb </LOCATION>. But Judge <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartnett </PERSON> said no merger would be allowed until legal questions surrounding the proposal were settled. The ConAgra-Holly merger would be accomplished through a stock swap valued at $ 59.25 a share, or about $ 1 billion, while <ORGANIZATION> Tyson </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 1.18 billion offer is for cash The struggle to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION>, a diversified <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> company heavily dependant on fresh fryer sales, began last October. A takeover by <ORGANIZATION> Tyson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> would permit the <LOCATION> Springdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, company to keep its standing as the nation's largest poultry processor. One of the main snags in the merger proposal announced last year by <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> is a lockup option that would permit <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> to buy prime <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> assets should their proposed merger fall through. <PERSON> Hartnett </PERSON> has yet to rule on the validity of that agreement, which <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> claims was designed to make Holly Farms unattractive to any buyer other than <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>'s buyout offer is contingent on dissolution of the lockup, which is why <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> rejected it, <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Farms </PERSON> said in a statement. `` Until Tyson removes from its tender offer the ` asset option' condition, <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> stockholders can have no assurance that <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>'s $ 63.50 price represents deliverable value,'' the statement said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>, son of Tyson President <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION>' rejection was `` about as anticipated.'' <ORGANIZATION> Tyson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> is filing proxy materials with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and hopes to get it to <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> stockholders sometime next week, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 A British and an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> scientist said Thursday they have produced controlled nuclear fusion using basic chemistry that could lead to a technology capable of driving electrical generators within a few years. `` What we have done is opened the door of a new research area,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Southampton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. `` Our indications are that the discovery will be relatively easy to make into a usable technology for generating heat and power.'' Nuclear fusion, the power that fuels the sun, is regarded as science's next great frontier in developing new sources of energy, but has generally been considered to be years away from commercial exploitation. It differs from conventional processes in that it fuses atoms, rather than splits them, and generates little radioactive waste. <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> and <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Pons </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION>'s chemistry department, said at a news conference here that in laboratory tests, their `` cold-temperature'' electrochemical process has produced a surplus of energy for periods of up to 100 hours. However, the researchers cautioned that more research is needed to determine whether the process will work on a large scale. `` We do n't know what the implications are. The science base has to be established as widely as possible to challenge our findings,'' <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> said. `` But it does seem there is a possibility of realizing sustained fusion in a relatively simple device.'' If the technology is practical on a large scale, it would provide a safe, relatively clean and virtually inexhaustible energy source. Other nuclear scientists said the experiment will have to be duplicated independently before the findings of <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> can be accepted. `` People are pushing cold-temperature nuclear fusion quite vigorously these days. Like any science, this claim has to be reproducible. If it is indeed there, it is quite a discovery,'' said <PERSON> Chan </PERSON> <PERSON> Choi </PERSON>, a fusion researcher at <ORGANIZATION> Purdue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s School of Nuclear Engineering. <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> said that in the process, an electrical current is used to drive nuclear particles through a lattice of palladium and platinum electrodes, forcing positively charged particles to fuse together and create a new atom. Unlike more traditional fusion techniques which require tremendous heat, and are therefore very expensive, the electrochemical process is carried out at room temperature in a fragile glass flask. Scientists have sought a practical application of fusion for about 35 years. Existing nuclear reactors are powered by nuclear fission. <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> said the amount of deuterium, the source of the deuteron particles used in the process, contained in one cubic foot of seawater could produce as much energy as 10 tons of coal. <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> had developed the technique after 5 -LCB- years of research and financed it with about $ 100,000 of their own money. They conceived of the idea while hiking in a canyon east of <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and conducted their first experiment on <PERSON> Pons </PERSON>' kitchen. `` <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> and I thought the experiment was so stupid, we financed it ourselves,'' <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> said. `` If you scale it up, we could burn up a few million.'' <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> said the research has been submitted to a scientific journal, which he declined to name. If accepted, it would be published in May, he said. The pair now are seeking a grant from the federal <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> to continue their research. <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said the school has applied for patents to cover the techniques in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and internationally. `` Everything we know about it says it ought to have commercial application,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Purdue </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Chan </PERSON> said most `` cold-fusion'' research involves using a subatomic particle as a catalyst to start the fusion reaction, while the main thrust of fusion research has involved heating particles to superhot temperatures of more than 1 million degrees while simultaneously compressing them. `` The low temperature is quite a departure from the norm. If the -LRB- research -RRB- is correct, that's quite an achievement,'' he said. To create fusion, scientists must prevent positive ions from repelling one another so that they can fuse together. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morse </PERSON>, a professor of physics and nuclear engineering at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION>, said this can be done by accelerating them to a high velocity _ by heating them or by using a particle accelerator _ or by blocking out the positive trait. Cold fusion, he said, attempts to block the natural repulsion. `` I'd be a little skeptical that anything of economic value could be achieved this way,'' <PERSON> Morse </PERSON> said. `` Some of the limitations are pretty fundamental.''
