<TEXT>
 Riot police firing water cannons and tear gas broke up street protests in this capital city on Wednesday during a Communist-led general strike that paralyzed transportation. Small pockets of strikers blocked streets with flaming tires and rubble before being driven off. The government said 13 protesters were arrested in <LOCATION> Quito </LOCATION>. News reports said six people were detained in <LOCATION> Guayquil </LOCATION>, the nation's financial center and largest city with 2 million people, 180 miles southwest of the capital Interior Minister <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> Moeller </PERSON> called the strike a failure. He said nearly all of the nation's labor force of 3 million workers ignored the strike call. <PERSON> Moeller </PERSON> told a news conference a capital policeman was injured by a firebomb tossed by a protester. There were no other reports of injury. Strike leader <PERSON> Fausto </PERSON> <PERSON> Dutan </PERSON> said 80 percent of <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>'s business activity was halted by the strike, called to back demands for higher pay. Radio reports said the strike had little impact in provincial cities across this Andean nation, which is the size of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and has 10 million people. Strike protests waned as night fell. The downtown of this highland capital of 1.4 million residents was filled with tear gas, making breathing difficult for the few pedestrians left on the streets. President <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Febres </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON> said the strike, the seventh during his tenure, was illegal and declared a nationwide state of emergency. Combat troops were sent to guard electric generating plants, gasoline stations and other installations. Riot police patrolled streets and industrial sectors of <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>'s major cities. The nationwide strike was organized by the Communist-led <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laborers </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's most powerful labor federation, to seek wage increases. <PERSON> Dutan </PERSON> said the 200,000-member confederation wants the minimum monthly wage raised from $ 31 to $ 76. <PERSON> Moeller </PERSON> admitted that bus and taxi service in <LOCATION> Quito </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guayaquil </LOCATION> was nearly halted as drivers stayed off the job either in strike sympathy or in fear of violence. Many of <LOCATION> Quito </LOCATION>'s factories did not open because workers could not reach their jobs, news reports said. Banks, stores and shops in downtown <LOCATION> Quito </LOCATION> opened normally or slightly late but closed in early afternoon to avoid trouble. The government suspended school classes nationwide. <PERSON> Febres </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON>, a conservative whose four-year term ends Aug. 10, has faced increasing labor unrest over the past two years amid mounting economic woes, caused mainly by depressed world prices for oil, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>'s main export. <PERSON> Rodrigo </PERSON> <PERSON> Borja </PERSON>, a lawyer who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Left </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION>, won a presidential runoff election in May to replace <PERSON> Febres </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON>. <PERSON> Moeller </PERSON> said the state of emergency, which permits the government to deploy the military, ban public meetings and censor the media, would stay in force only until the strike officially ended at midnight Wednesday.

 When <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> was growing up in <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, her mother often worried about the future `` Entertainment Tonight'' host running away to become a showgirl. Well, Mom, do n't look now, but ... The perky blonde, who taught high school English and piano while doing community theater and dreaming of a show business career, recently made her stage debut in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. With more bookings here and in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, plus summer stock and music festivals this summer, <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>'s ready to continue her dual professional role, although she'd just as soon skip those 18-hour days, juggling two careers in two cities. Her grueling daily grind _ shuttling between this city's <LOCATION> Glitter </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulch </LOCATION> for her long-awaited fling at singing and dancing, then back to a <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> `` ET'' set for more TV patter _ gave new meaning to the concept of commuting to work. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> realized a lifelong dream when she spent two weeks appearing with comedian <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brenner </PERSON> at the Golden Nugget Hotel and Casino earlier this month. But she admits she would n't care for a steady diet of the double duty. `` I performed at 8 and again at 11,'' she said. `` Then I caught a 1 a.m. flight to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, and hit the house about 2:45. I got up at 7:30 and was at Paramount -LRB- where ` ET' is filmed -RRB- by 8 a.m.. We did our promos and other spots, then began taping the show at 11:30 a.m.. At 2:45 in the afternoon I was on a flight back to `` Both worlds is not an ideal situation,'' she laughed as she relaxed between shows during her two-week engagement. `` It's conceivable to do one show a night and commute for a short period of time. In her show, <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> does several dance numbers and displays a surprisingly good singing voice. Her appearance and style are reminiscent of Ann-Margret when she was a <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> headliner for years. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>'s sexy legs _ insured by <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> for $ 2 million _ are amply displayed in the <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> show. The legs are a product of a lot of hard work, including a treadmill, rowing machine and Exercycle at home, 25 miles of speed-walking a week, and aerobics and dance classes. She admits that coming into this town with a nationally known name did n't hurt her chances for success. But she thinks she had to have more than just a pretty, recognizable face _ and $ 2 million legs. `` You know, you're putting it all on the line when you come in here as a co-headliner,'' she said. `` There's no way of hiding it. But I wanted to do it. I was both exhilarated and intimidated by the experience.'' Her song-and-dance debut has given her a new appreciation of the people she covers on ` ET.' `` There's a lot of rejection and hard knocks. I'm far more appreciative for having experienced it firsthand.'' <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> admits to something of a <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitty </PERSON> lifestyle since her days in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. She's been a finalist in the Miss America Pageant -LRB- 1971 -RRB-, been a host of `` ET'' for five years, sparred with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>, sung the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anthem </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dodgers </ORGANIZATION> games, ridden with the <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angels </ORGANIZATION> flight team, danced on the Emmy awards show, injured one leg in a fall from the high wire on a `` Circus of the Stars'' performance and been co-host of the Tournament of Roses Parade coverage and the `` Regis Philbin Show.'' Despite all those credits she thinks her stage debut at the Golden Nugget was one of her toughest gigs. `` I prepared for the opening for months,'' she recalled. `` Then the day of the opening, after working all afternoon in dress rehearsals, I almost felt like I could n't do it. I proceeded to cry for three hours. `` Part of it was sheer fear; part of it was excitement. There were moments of being panic-stricken. But the overriding emotion was one of exhilaration. `` I have really always seen myself as an entertainer,'' she said. `` You dream those things, but you do n't know for sure if they'll ever happen. I think that was part of my emotionalism, realizing those things had come true.'' A few dreams _ a Broadway play and her own TV sitcom _ remain unfulfilled. But, at age 35, she thinks time is on her side. She's learned to roll with the punches, to be patient. After doing radio and TV talk shows in <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cedar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rapids </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, she moved West to headline `` PM Magazine.'' She left that show to co-host `` <ORGANIZATION> Regis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philbin </ORGANIZATION>'' _ which folded four months later. `` I was out of work and out of money,'' she recalled. `` That was a time I was terribly disappointed. Then ET came along. Thank heaven for my Midwestern upbringing, and positive thinking. `` My parents always told me that the bad times accentuate the good. I've always translated the negative experiences into good in the long run. I'm a big believer that life goes on. You get back from life what you put into it.''

<HEAD>Handwork Of Rural Women Reaches Out To The World</HEAD>

 It began with rural women passing on the traditional crafts of knitting and weaving, grandmother to mother to daughter. Today it is a $ 4-million-a-year business cooperative, shipping colorful sweaters around the world, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Manos del <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> -LRB- Hands of <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> -RRB- is made up of 18 rural cooperatives whose workers spin, knit, weave and dye virgin wool, one of <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>'s top commodities, entirely by hand. It was founded in 1968 by <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Beisso </PERSON> and four other members of <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>'s high society who had second homes on ranch estates outside <LOCATION> Montevideo </LOCATION>. Unemployment was high in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s smallest republic at the time, so the five devised a way for rural women to do what they knew best _ weave colorful sweaters using natural vegetable dyes and <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>'s virgin wool. The result is a richly colored wool woven in bright, distinctive sweaters, as well as in rugs, tapestries and placemats. Each article bears the name of the artisan and where it was made on a card accompanying the product. Finding many of the artisans' work sites on a map is often difficult: they include Tacuarembo, said to be the birthplace of famed tango singer <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardel </PERSON>, and villages such as <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mellizos </LOCATION> and Quebracho. One thousand workers in more than 40 sites, some using just a loom or a table under a tree, labor over the sweaters, tapestries and rugs. Each sweater takes 12 to 28 hours to finish, Mrs. <PERSON> Beisso </PERSON> said. Most of the sweaters end up in shops in neighboring <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, but many are shipped to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>. Seventy percent of Manos' sweaters are exported, said <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Orfila </PERSON> <PERSON> Algalarronda </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Algalarronda </PERSON>, 36, was with Manos from its start, weaving from the village of <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> la </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>. Two decades later, she is secretary counsel of the seven-member directorate -LRB- five women, two men -RRB- that oversees Manos' operations from <LOCATION> Montevideo </LOCATION>. Now one of <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>'s largest exporters of wool, <LOCATION> Manos </LOCATION> is well-regarded in business circles for the quality of its work and fashion acumen. `` Manos is an experience that's practically unique in the world,'' Ms. <PERSON> Algalarronda </PERSON> said in an interview. `` The world is a very competitive place and <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> is a very small place. But at a minimum Manos has turned into a source of work for 1,000 women.'' Each sweater, which costs the equivalent of about $ 30 in <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, sells for up to $ 300 in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Cecilia </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, an aide in the promotion department of Manos' main office in the oldtown section of this capital city. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, Manos sweaters can be found in some <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fifth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avenue </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> stores, Mrs. <PERSON> Beisso </PERSON> said. Manos recently opened a small showroom in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Algalarronda </PERSON> said 50 designs are ready for the 1989 summer collection, including sweaters specially made for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> -LRB- `` smaller sizes because the Japanese are smaller'' -RRB-, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> -LRB- `` simpler designs'' -RRB- and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> -LRB- `` reds and blacks are popular'' -RRB-. A specially designed sofa that Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> used at a Mass in <LOCATION> Salto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, on his visit in May was produced by <PERSON> Manos </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Beisso </PERSON> said. Manos is set up so that regional leaders from each cooperative elect representatives who then report to the directorate in <LOCATION> Montevideo </LOCATION>. All business decisions, from designs to marketing and exports, are made only after receiving input from the interior, Ms. <PERSON> Algalarronda </PERSON> said. Any profits _ 1987 sales were $ 4 million _ are plowed back into the business, helping keep those workers employed, which was the founding purpose of <LOCATION> Manos </LOCATION>. `` It's a fine source of employment but not a good business,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Beisso </PERSON> said. `` The people in the country are the ones who really profit from this.''

 Some Republicans refer to first-term Sen. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingaman </PERSON> as the `` invisible senator,'' and their conviction that he can be beaten has lured four candidates to seek the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination in the June 7 primary. <PERSON> Bingaman </PERSON> is vulnerable because of his liberal voting record and his position on national defense issues, said state <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lattauzio </PERSON>. `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s congressmen philosophically have always supported defense spending until <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingaman </PERSON> came along,'' he said. `` And economically defense spending is very important to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. `` If we can articulate these issues effectively, the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate will do very well,'' Lattauzio said. `` Another thing we will be able to talk about a lot is that <PERSON> Bingaman </PERSON> is the ` invisible senator.' New Mexicans are accustomed to their congressmen staying in touch with them,'' Lattauzio said. `` <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> just has n't been around up until recently.'' <PERSON> Bingaman </PERSON> said in January when he announced for re-election that as one of only two first-term Democrats running this year _ the other is <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON> _ he expected his race to be targeted by the national <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. But Democrats question whether the Republican field of state Sens. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Valentine </PERSON>, 44, and <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Carraro </PERSON>, 43, both of <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, long-time party activist <PERSON> Corky </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, 52, of <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, and former <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruces </LOCATION> can produce a strong challenger to <PERSON> Bingaman </PERSON>. Polls showing a high percentage of undecided Republicans, far greater than the percentage favoring any candidate, indicate none of the four has caught fire with the voters. Valentine and <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, however, appear to be the front-runners. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON>, a former state <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> chairman, said <PERSON> Bingaman </PERSON> may be vulnerable but not with any of this year's Republican candidates `` Those guys are all wallflowers who follow the old party line,'' <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON> said. `` I think had the Republicans had a charismatic candidate running against <PERSON> Bingaman </PERSON>, he would have a tough time in the fall.'' <PERSON> Valentine </PERSON>, who sold his dentistry practice to campaign fulltime, and <PERSON> Carraro </PERSON>, who owns and operates two pizza restaurants, are giving up their state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seats to try for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, who owns trucking and warehousing companies in <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, is a former state <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> chairman and was <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> chairman of the Reagan-Bush campaign in 1984. <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON> left the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration as assistant secretary of <ORGANIZATION> interior </ORGANIZATION> for terriorities and international affairs to return to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and seek elective office for the first time. <PERSON> Bingaman </PERSON>, who is unopposed in the Democratic primary, is a Harvard-educated lawyer who in 1982 defeated first-term Republican Sen. <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> `` <PERSON> Jack </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmitt </PERSON>, a former astronaut. <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bingaman </PERSON> has recognized his problems and corrected most of them, including that he had not been communicating with his constituency on a regular basis. He also has been spending more time in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in the last year, meeting with residents. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> race and presidential voting top <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s primary ballot, but the retirement after 20 years of Republican Rep. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> has thrown open the door in the 1st Congressional District. Three Republicans, including <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON>'s younger brother <PERSON> Edward </PERSON>, and nine Democrats aspire to succeed <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON>, who has called it quits after 20 years in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON>, 55, is an <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION> insurance executive and former state <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> chairman. Challenging him are <LOCATION> Bernalillo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION> and state Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Budagher </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Annual Rite Of NYC Spring: Brawling Landlords And Tenants</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Ah, springtime in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>: The first robin in Central Park. The first ballgame at Yankee Stadium. And the first angry protester ejected from Police Headquarters in the annual brawl over city rents. `` People get frustrated, people get thrown out, their blood pressure goes way up,'' says <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, head of a landlord group, in summing up the yearly hike-or-hold-the-rent fight before the city <ORGANIZATION> Rent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guidelines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, beginning its hearings today. The proceedings match angry tenants with irate landlords, with roughly the same results as introducing <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> to patrons in a topless bar. Rhetoric is thick and animosity thicker, with supporters on both sides cheering, jeering and -LRB- with the aid of police -RRB- disappearing during the session. Slightly more than 50 percent of the city's apartments are covered by the board's guidelines under a system that has its roots in the city's World War II housing scarcity. Although the owners routinely request double-digit increases on one - and two-year leases, the board generally grants a much lower increase This year, <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> asked for increases of 15 percent on one-year leases and 19 percent on two-year leases. The hearings _ once held privately, but opened to the public by court order in 1979 _ are held inside Police Headquarters for security reasons. Dozens of police officers are assigned to the hearings, and others are available if verbal arguments get out of hand. `` The headquarters is the only place where we have the ability to keep things under restraint,'' explained veteran board member <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Forstadt </PERSON>, who's seen several participants dragged out over the past four years. `` Otherwise ...'' Otherwise there'd be more stories like these: _ A woman was arrested two years ago for biting the finger of the police officer who was dragging her from the auditorium. `` It was unclear which point of view she was biting for,'' recalled <PERSON> Forstadt </PERSON>. _ <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> Rent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stabilization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> represents 25,000 building owners, stood up and dramatically tore a dollar bill in half last year to demonstrate how landlord profits were down 50 percent from 1971. Tenants derisively greeted the display with boos. _ In 1984, after the usual spate of insults, obscenities and outbursts in English, a group of Spanish-speaking tenants enlivened the hearing with chants of `` Callate! Callate!'' _ `` Shut up! Shut up!'' _ as a landlord spoke. After all the sign-waving and screaming is finished, the nine-member <ORGANIZATION> Rent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guidelines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> determines whether rent increases should be granted, and if so, how much. The oldest and most stringent guideline, rent control, covers 218,000 apartments; when they become vacant, they come under a rent stabilization guideline, which covers 943,000 apartment. `` When you have landlords and tenants at the same meeting _ which I think is a mistake _ you're bound to have turmoil,'' said 77-year-old <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedict </PERSON>, founder and chairman emeritus of the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION>, a tenant group. <PERSON> Benedict </PERSON>, a fixture in rent fights since 1969, has attended every board hearing since they went public. She sees no end to the near-anarchy of the hearings; in fact, the problem of homelessness could make this year's affair even wilder, she predicted. `` Everybody knows <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> rents are outrageous. The feelings are intense,'' she said. `` It's not just an academic debate. We're talking about people with no place to live.'' At least one landlord group blames the media for stirring up anti-landlord sentiment and making the hearings contentious. <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Silber </PERSON>, vice-president of the <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Property </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Owners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, cited recent tabloid stories on `` The Dracula Landlord'' and `` The Reptile Landlord'' as well as the annual Village Voice listing of the city's 10 worst landlords. Nevertheless, <PERSON> Silber </PERSON> believes the animosity level has decreased over the past two years; <PERSON> Benedict </PERSON>, almost predictably, disagrees. But <PERSON> Forstadt </PERSON> said there is an interesting phenomenon which occurs each year among the participants. `` After six or seven hours, it's hard to tell the landlords from the tenants when they're talking,'' he said. `` They're both under such distress, they begin to feel sympathetic toward one another. ... There's a sense of cohesion. They're all in the same boat.''

Still, `` the Soviets have expressed particular interest in having Pralines' n Cream and <PERSON> Jamoca </PERSON> <PERSON> Almond </PERSON> <PERSON> Fudge </PERSON>,'' Ms. <PERSON> Novak </PERSON> said. `` They have requested those two, along with other typical American ice creams.'' The Soviets, who already enjoy excellent domestic ice cream, will operate the store, while the company will train Soviet employees, provide the necessary equipment and decor, and supply the ice cream itself, she said. A cone will sell for about a ruble, or roughly $ 1.60, Ms. <PERSON> Novak </PERSON> said. `` We're going to be putting our first store at the Rossiya Hotel,'' Ms. <PERSON> Novak </PERSON> said.

 A distance runner's plan to finance a 964-mile jog across <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> with a raffle has been tripped up by the state <ORGANIZATION> Gambling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which says the plan is illegal. `` We did n't know anything about it,'' <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, a 68-year-old real-estate agent and long-distance runner, said Tuesday. `` I've never don anything in my life that is wrong.'' <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> said he has located two corporate sponsors willing to put up the $ 10,000 to $ 12,000 needed, and will return the approximately $ 800 he had raised from the $ 10 raffle tickets, as the commission has ordered. Only bona fide non-profit organizations are allowed to operate raffles, and state law sets the maximum raffle ticket price at $ 5, said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Layton </PERSON>, a commission spokesman. <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> had enticed raffle purchasers with the chance to win round trip tickets for two to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. He said the setback wo n't alter plans for his 20-day jaunt from <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Groats </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, to Land's End, on the southern tip of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, scheduled to begin June 21. The 5-foot-8 <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, who weighs 140 pounds, plans to run 50 miles a day to complete the route. `` No man 68 years old ever ran it,'' said <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, a World War II veteran who took up running 26 years ago because he was getting out of shape. Plans call for running nine to 10 hours a day, with breaks for massages and meals. <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>'s coach is <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Emmerton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, a long-distance runner who ran the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> route in 1965. It is the longest run yet for <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, whose past efforts have raised thousands of dollars for charities around the state. The current run is not for charity, he said. The money is needed to pay for air fare, a training van and pace car, food and hotels. In 1985, <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> ran 130 miles from the <LOCATION> Kingdome </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> to the Peace Arch near <LOCATION> Blaine </LOCATION>, his boyhood home, on the Canadian border. That raised $ 20,000 for a nursing home in <LOCATION> Blaine </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Upholds Discount Store Practice</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Distributors of discount merchandise say consumers are the big winners in a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling upholding a lion's share of the multibillion-dollar `` gray market'' that allows costly imports to be sold at reduced prices. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-R.I. </LOCATION>, sponsor of a bill favoring gray market imports, also praised the decision. `` This is very good news for everyone in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> who likes to save a dollar or many dollars on imported goods like televisions, cameras, and perfume,'' he said. <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON>, a lawyer for discount dealer 47th <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Photo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said the decision will mean savings for buyers of brand-name imports. `` I think the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling today is a great victory for American consumers and for the right of merchandisers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> seeking to bring products manufactured abroad into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at realistic and honest prices,'' he said. By a 5-4 vote, the court upheld key <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> regulations that permit the gray market _ brand-name, foreign-made goods bearing valid <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trademarks sold in this country without approval from trademark owners. The gray market is estimated to produce $ 5 billion to $ 10 billion a year in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, with consumers buying everything from German sedans and French champagne to Japanese cameras and watches. The business began to flourish when the value of the dollar on the international currency exchange rose dramatically in the early 1980s. But the more recent decline in the dollar apparently has not substantially depressed the American appetite for gray market foreign goods. The gray market is created when foreign goods are purchased abroad and sold through discount retailers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in competition with the owners of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trademarks of those products. Trademark owners say they are being shortchanged because they are forced to charge a markup to help cover advertising, warranty and service costs. K mart <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and 47th Street Photo, two leading discount distributors, joined with the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to defend the gray market. Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> _ the court's newest member _ provided the pivotal vote in the decision. By a separate 5-4 vote, the court struck down another <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> rule that could have been used to expand the gray market. Some lawyers for discounters said that rule probably is inconsequential. But another attorney representing discounters said there may be loopholes in the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision that would allow trademark owners to block the gray market in the future. That lawyer, who asked to remain anonymous, said trademark holders `` could get around the ruling in time'' by conveying their trademark to an independent company that then would be able to block competing imports. The Customs Service for more than 50 years permitted gray market imports when foreign manufacturers of the goods are affiliated with the owners of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trademarks. The rules apply when the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trademark holder is a subsidiary of, parent of or the same as the foreign manufacturer. The regulations were challenged by some 60 major trademark owners that banded together to form the Coalition to Preserve the Integrity of American Trademarks. In other matters, the court: _ Ruled by a 5-3 vote that states sometimes may execute convicted murderers even if their constitutional right to a lawyer's help was violated The justices said such violations may be deemed `` harmless'' but they overturned a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> killer's death sentence after ruling that the violation in his case was not harmless. _ Unanimously struck down the way <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> promotes through tax credits the use of `` gasohol,'' a motor vehicle fuel less environmentally troublesome than gasoline _ Cleared the way for price deregulation of some natural gas _ an 8-0 decision the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration said could save consumers an estimated $ 100 million a year _ Unanimously gave federal regulators, in a test case from <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, broad power to oust bank executives from their jobs temporarily when the executives are accused of serious crimes

<HEAD>Report: Growing Number Of Students Commit Suicide Over Exams</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Pressure from school work and exams drove at least 50 secondary school students to commit suicide last year and 10 students killed themselves in May alone, a newspaper reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> Korea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> reported a growing number of suicides among high school and middle school students because of pressure from school work and college entrance examinations. It warned that the number of student suicides would increase unless education policy changes. The latest death was reported Monday, when a 17-year-old student, upset over his poor academic performance, jumped from a bridge to his death. He left a note that said, `` Sorry for my lack of responsibility.'' On May 18, the newspaper said, a 16-year-old high school girl jumped to her death from an apartment one day after two high school girls killed themselves over their poor school record. Most suicide notes left behind by students blamed pressure from hard school work or poor exam results. `` I want to live in a country where there is no examination,'' said a suicide note from an 18-year-old student in the southern city of <LOCATION> Andong </LOCATION>. To reduce the pressure, educators are proposing drastic reforms of the system, which puts heavy emphasis on rote learning, the paper said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> created to solve the government's budget troubles is finding it tough to agree on just what that task entails. <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> co-chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer and political dealmaker, says the `` mandate is clear.'' The president and next <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> need `` a political solution'' for reducing the federal deficit, in the form of recommendations to close the gap between spending and taxes. But commission member <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>, the former defense secretary, expressed surprise at a meeting Tuesday when a witness suggested that making policy choices would be difficult. `` Are you suggesting that this commission is supposed to make specific recommendations for budget cuts and tax increases?'' <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivlin </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> think tank. <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> and fellow Republican <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Rumsfeld </PERSON>, another former <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary, had focused their remarks on changing the cumbersome budget process. The two former administration officials suggested changing the system to give the president more power over what they described as a spendthrift <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 Former Attorney General <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> B. <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> ignored evidence that top <PERSON> E.F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> executives orchestrated a widespread check-kiting scheme when he blamed mid-level managers in a defamatory report, the lawyer for one of those managers says. <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, a defendant in a defamation suit brought by one of six branch managers he criticized in the 1985 report about the check-kiting scheme, was trying to shift the blame away from top management, the lawyer argued Tuesday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. `` He cleared the company, he cleared the management and put the blame out on regional managers and branch managers,'' <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Milliken </PERSON>, a lawyer for former <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> manager <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearce </PERSON>, said as the defamation trial got under way. <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, a private attorney in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, was retained by <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> to conduct the internal investigation after the company pleaded guilty May 2, 1985, to 2,000 counts of mail and wire fraud for manipulating its checking accounts. The company admitted writing checks for amounts exceeding money in the accounts, thereby giving itself interest-free loans. The accounts were replenished before the overdrawn checks cleared, enabling <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> to make extra money by `` riding the float.'' <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON>, which is now part of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, agreed to pay a $ 2 million fine and reimburse banks that were victims of the check-kiting scheme. Federal investigators said the company had interest-free use of $ 250 million a day. <PERSON> Milliken </PERSON> said the practice was conceived in the late 1970s by <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> management and promoted as a way to get interest-free loans from banks. `` The entire operation was known to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, understood by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, created by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Milliken </PERSON> said. But `` Mr. <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, by his investigation cleared everybody in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, a partner in the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> law firm of <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Spalding </PERSON>, was retained shortly after the guilty plea was entered by the company. He produced a report three months later that recommended that <PERSON> Pearce </PERSON> and eight other branch and regional executives be disciplined. The report exonerated all but one top management official, whom <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> recommended be stripped of any duties involving <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON>'s banking activities <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Silbert </PERSON>, said the former attorney general's probe `` was a carefuly, thorough, meticulous and fair and independent investigation.'' <PERSON> Silbert </PERSON> charged that <PERSON> Pearce </PERSON> violated company policies limiting overdrafts in order to make extra money. <PERSON> Pearce </PERSON> overdrew by as much as 400 percent to take his 10 percent share of interest profits that were given branch managers as an incentive for efficient cash management, <PERSON> Silbert </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> carefully refrained from accusing top managers because there was insufficient evidence they did anything wrong, he said. But <PERSON> Pearce </PERSON> and the others named in the report were criticized because `` their conduct was so egregious and abusive and so aggravated and the evidence of proof so overwhelming that he would have been derelict in his responsibility if he had not so named them,'' said <PERSON> Silbert </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney. <PERSON> Milliken </PERSON> said the overdrafting policies were so important to <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON>'s business strategy that <PERSON> Pearce </PERSON> was admonished when he did not write checks for more than the amounts in the accounts. `` They taught him to overdraft, they told him what branches to use,'' he said. <PERSON> Milliken </PERSON> argued that <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>'s independence was undermined by his relationship to <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON>, which paid <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Spalding $ 2.5 million to conduct the investigation. `` <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> was supplying the information, <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> was supplying the fee, <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> was controlling the timing of when the report would be released,'' <PERSON> Milliken </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, a former federal appeals judge who was President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s first attorney general, was paid at a rate of $ 1,711 an hour for 518 hours of work <PERSON> Pearce </PERSON> also sued <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON>, but a federal appeals court ruled that his claim against the brokerage firm must first be submitted to arbitration by the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>.

 Fourteen school and church groups are giving their imprimatur to a new pamphlet that lays out constitutional ways for public schools to teach about religion in a way that does not advocate a particular belief. The sponsors said Tuesday that endorsement of the document by such diverse groups as the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evangelicals </ORGANIZATION> and the research arm of <ORGANIZATION> Americans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Separation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> indicates that the time is ripe for a resurgence of instruction about religion. `` The question is no longer should we teach about religion,'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Americans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> told a news conference. `` The question is how do we do this?'' Other participants called the 1,000-word pamphlet historic and expressed hope it will embolden teachers and principals to give religion its due in history, literature and other classes. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> said it shows `` there is a nobler and better way to deal with religion in public schools than simply to yell at each other and threaten a lawsuit.'' All too often, debates about religion in public schools have degenerated into `` a hog-calling or a shouting match,'' <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> said. Secular and religious groups alike, as well as Secretary of Education <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, have complained in recent years that religion gets short shrift in most American classrooms and textbooks, even in courses that teach about historical events in which religion played a prominent part. Some critics blamed publishers' fear of controversy, while others attribute it to an overreaction by educators to <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rulings in the 1960s that barred state-sponsored school prayer and Bible reading. The pamphlet provides guidance in question-and-answer form for school boards, teachers and others. The pamphlet, called `` Religion in the Public School Curriculum: Questions and Answers,'' notes that the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has ruled unconstitutional a <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> law that required schools to teach the Biblical account of creation in science classes. But it said the high court also acknowledged a variety of scientific theories about origins can appropriately be taught in a science class. The pamphlet added, `` Though science instruction may not endorse or promote religious doctrine, the account of creation found in various scriptures may be discussed in a religious studies class or in any course that considers religious explanations for the origin of life.'' The pamphlet gives the following general advice on how to teach about religion: _ `` The school's approach is academic, not devotional.'' _ `` The school may sponsor study about religion, but may not sponsor the practice of religion.'' _ `` The school may educate about all religions, but may not promote or denigrate any religion.'' _ `` The school may inform the student about various beliefs, but should not seek to conform him or her to any particular belief.'' `` Because religion plays a significant role in history and society,'' the pamphlet said, `` study about religion is essential to understanding both the nation and the world. Omission of facts about religion can give students the false impression that the religious life of humankind is insignificant or unimportant.'' `` Failure to understand even the basic symbols, practices and concepts of the various religions makes much of history, literature, art and contemporary life unintelligible.'' The pamphlet recommends `` careful'' handling of religious holidays in the classroom, with information focusing `` on the origin, history and generally agreed-upon meaning of the observances.'' Other sponsors include the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Religion </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administrators </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christians </ORGANIZATION> and Jews, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Curriculum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>.

All American Indians were made full <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens by an act of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1924. <PERSON> Suzan </PERSON> <PERSON> Harjo </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION>, said she found the remark about `` humoring'' the <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> `` particularly insulting.'' <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON>, president of the Denver-based <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` I'm a fan of the president, but the president is a little bit removed from the reality of American Indians.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> volunteered his comments when he was asked by a student if he would meet with three Indians visiting <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> under the auspices of the militant <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>. They went to the summit city to call attention to the problems of American Indians. `` We have provided millions of acres of land for what are called preservations _ or the reservations, I should say,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` They, from the beginning, announced that they wanted to maintain their way of life, as they had always lived there in the desert and the plains and so forth. And we set up these reservations so they could, and have a <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> to help take care of them.'' Though many Indians leave the reservations, many stay, the president noted. The 1980 census found 1.37 million Indians, among whom 332,000 were living on 260 reservations. `` We've done everything we can to meet their demands as to what they _ how they want to live,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said, `` He appears not to know that Indians are citizens. `` He must have been learning from these old celluloid Westerns of the 1930s he used to act in,'' the congressman said. `` There's no question that <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> do n't want to lose their traditions. But I do n't know any Indians who want to be primitive.'' <PERSON> Harjo </PERSON> said, `` I thought his notion of having granted Indians millions of acres of land was astonishing ... There was no grant involved; his ancestors were n't dragging any land behind them when they came to this country. `` He has headed the worst administration for <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> since the days of outright warfare and extermination,'' she said, because of `` consistent efforts by this administration to undo legal, long-standing rights and wipe out programs that meet our needs.'' Indians leave reservations for better jobs and education `` and politics,'' <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON> said. `` Life can be very hard on a reservation if you're part of the ` Out' party.'' But, `` Many Indians do n't have the choice to move off the reservation'' because they have no job skills that mainstream society will pay for, <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON> said. American Indians are among the poorest, worst-off of Americans. A government study noted that the 1980 census found 12 percent of all Americans living in poverty, but poverty among Indians affected 22 percent of those living off the reservation and 41 percent of Indians living on reservations. Unemployment on reservations frequently exceeds 60 percent and can reach 80 percent. Young Indian adults commit suicide at a rate six times their counterparts in mainstream society. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> noted that government policy had tried to dissolve tribes and force Indians to join mainstream culture as small farmers in 1887-1934, then turned around and tried to maintain tribes and tribal governments, but then flipped again to `` termination'' of tribes in the <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> administration in the 1950s and flopped back to `` government-to-government'' policy in subsequent administrations, a policy <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has affirmed. As for AIM and its three members in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> said, `` People in AIM do not speak for all Indians. They speak for only a small minority.''

<HEAD>Text of Reagan Speech Before University Students</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Following is the text of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s speech Tuesday before a student assembly at <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>: Well, thank you, <PERSON> Rector </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagunov </PERSON>. And I want to thank all of you very much for a very warm welcome. It's a great pleasure to be here at <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, and I want to thank you all for turning out. I know you must be very busy this week, studying and taking your final examinations. So let me just say, -LRB- speaks in Russian -RRB-. -LRB- Applause. -RRB- <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> could n't make it today because she's visiting <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>, which she tells me is a very beautiful city. But she, too, says hello, and wishes you all good luck. Let me say it's also a great pleasure to once again have this opportunity to speak directly to the people of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Before I left <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, I received many heartfelt letters and telegrams, asking me to carry here a simple message, perhaps, but also one of the most important business of this summit. It is a message of peace and good will and hope for a growing friendship and closeness between our two peoples. As you know, I've come to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to meet with one of your most distinguished graduates. In this, our fourth summit, General Secretary <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and I have spent many hours together, and I feel that we're getting to know each other well. Our discussions, of course, have been focused primarily on many of the important issues of the day, issues I want to touch on with you in a few moments. But first, I want to take a little time to talk to you, much as I would to any group of university students in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. I want to talk not just of the realities of today, but of the possibilities of tomorrow. Standing here before a mural of your revolution, I want to talk about a very different revolution that is taking place right now, quietly sweeping the globe without bloodshed or conflict. Its effects are peaceful, but they will fundamentally alter our world, shatter old assumptions and reshape our lives. It's easy to underestimate, because it's not accompanied by banners or fanfare. It's been called the `` technological'' or `` information'' revolution. And, as its emblem, one might take the tiny silicon chip, no bigger than a fingerprint. One of these chips has more computing power than a roomful of old-style computers. As part of an exchange program, we now have an exhibition touring your country that shows how information technology is transforming our lives, replacing manual labor with robots, forecasting weather for farmers, or mapping the genetic code of DNA for medical researchers. These microcomputers today aid the design of everything from houses to cars to spacecraft. They even design better and faster computers. They can translate English into Russian, or enable the blind to read, or help <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> produce on one synthesizer the sounds of a whole orchestra. Linked by a network of satellites and fiber optic cables, one individual with a desktop computer and a telephone commands resources unavailable to the largest governments just a few years ago. Like a chrysalis, we are emerging from the economy of the industrial revolution, an economy confined to and limited by the earth's physical resources, into, as one economist titled his book, `` The Economy in Mind,'' in which there are no bounds on human imagination and the freedom to create is the most precious natural resource. Think of that little computer chip. Its value is n't in the sand from which it is made, but in the microscopic architecture designed into it by ingenious human minds. Or take the example of the satellite relaying this broadcast around the world, which replaces thousands of tons of copper mined from the earth and molded into wire. In the new economy, human invention increasingly makes physical resources obsolete. We are breaking through the material conditions of existence to a world where man creates his own destiny. Even as we explore the most advanced reaches of science, we are returning to the age-old wisdom of our culture, a wisdom contained in the book of the Genesis in the Bible. In the beginning was the spirit, and it was from this spirit that the material abundance of creation issued forth. But progress is not foreordained. The key is freedom _ freedom of thought, freedom of information, freedom of communication. The renowned scientist, scholar and founding father of this university, <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Lomonosov </PERSON>, knew that. `` It is common knowledge,'' he said, `` that the achievements of science are considerable and rapid, particularly once the yoke of slavery is cast off and replaced by the freedom of philosophy.'' You know, one of the first contacts between your country and mine took place between <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> and American explorers. The Americans were members of <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>'s last voyage on an expedition searching for an Arctic passage. On the island of <LOCATION> Unalaska </LOCATION>, they came upon the Russians, who took them in, and together with the native inhabitants, held a prayer service on the ice. The explorers of the modern era are the entrepreneurs, men with vision, with a courage to take risks and faith enough to brave the unknown. These entrepreneurs and their small enterprises are responsible for almost all the economic growth in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. They are the prime movers of the technological revolution. In fact, one of the largest personal computer firms in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was started by two college students, no older than you, in the garage behind their home. Some people, even in my own country, look at the riot of experiment that is the free market and see only waste. What of all the entrepreneurs that fail? Well, many do, particularly the successful ones, often several times. And if you ask them the secret of their success, they'll tell you it's all that they learned in their struggles along the way Yes, it's what they learned from failing, like an athlete in competition or a scholar in pursuit of the truth. Experience is the greatest teacher. And that's why it's so hard for government planners, no matter how sophisticated, to ever substitute for millions of individuals working night and day to make their dreams come true.

<HEAD>MOSCOW: come true.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The fact is, bureaucracies are a problem around the world. There's an old story about a town _ it could be anywhere _ with a bureaucrat who is known to be a good-for-nothing, but he somehow had always hung onto power. So one day, in a town meeting, an old woman got up and said to him, `` There is a folk legend here, where I come from, that when a baby is born, an angel comes down from heaven and kisses it on one part of its body. If the angel kisses him on his hand, he becomes a handyman. If he kisses him on his forehead, he becomes bright and clever. And I've been trying to figure out where the angel kissed you so that you should sit there for so long and do nothing.'' -LRB- Applause. -RRB- We are seeing the power of economic freedom spreading around the world. Places such as the Republic of <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> have vaulted into the technological era, barely pausing in the industrial age along the way. Low-tax agricultural policies in the sub-continent mean that in some years, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> is now a net exporter of food. Perhaps most exciting are the winds of change that are blowing over the People's <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, where one-quarter of the world's population is now getting its first taste of economic freedom. At the same time, the growth of democracy has become one of the most powerful political movements of our age. In <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in the 1970s, only a third of the population lived under democratic government. Today, over 90 percent does. In the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, in the Republic of <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, free contested democratic elections are the order of the day. Throughout the world, free markets are the model for growth. Democracy is the standard by which governments are measured. We Americans make no secret of our belief in freedom. In fact, it's something of a national pastime. Every four years, the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people choose a new president, and 1988 is one of those years. At one point, there were 13 major candidates running in the two major parties, not to mention all the others, including the Socialist and <ORGANIZATION> Libertarian </ORGANIZATION> candidates, all trying to get my job. About a 1,000 local television stations, 8,500 radio stations and 1,700 daily newspapers, each one an independent private enterprise, fiercely independent of the government, report on the candidates, grill them in interviews and bring them together for debates. In the end, the people vote. They decide who will be the next president. But freedom does n't begin or end with elections. Go to any <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> town, to take just an example, and you'll see dozens of churches, representing many different beliefs, in many places, synagogues and mosques, and you will see families of every conceivable nationality worshiping together. Go into any school room, and there you will see children being taught the Declaration of Independence; that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights, among them life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, that no government can justly deny; the guarantees in their Constitution for freedom of speech, freedom of assembly and freedom of religion. Go into any courtroom and there will preside an independent judge beholden to no government power. There, every defendant has the right to a trial by a jury of his peers, usually 12 men and women, common citizens. They are the ones, the only ones, who weigh the evidence and decide on guilt or innocence. In that court, the accused is innocent until proven guilty, and the word of a policeman or any official has no greater legal standing than the word of the accused. Go to any university campus and there you will find an open, sometimes heated discussion of the problems in American society and what can be done to correct them. Turn on the television, and you will see the legislature conducting the business of government right there before the camera, debating and voting on the legislation that will become the law of the land. March in any demonstration _ and there are many of them. The people's right of assembly is guaranteed in the Constitution and protected by the police. Go into any union hall where the members know their right to strike is protected by law. As a matter of fact, one of the many jobs I had before this one was being president of a union, the Screen Actors Guild. I led my union out on strike, and I'm proud to say we won. But freedom is more even than this. Freedom is the right to question and change the established way of doing things. It is the continuing revolution of the marketplace. It is the understanding that allows us to recognize shortcomings and seek solutions. It is the right to put forth and idea, scoffed at by the experts, and watch it catch fire among the people. It is the right to stick _ to dream, to follow your dream or stick to your conscience, even if you are the only one in a sea of doubters. Freedom is the recognition that no single person, no single authority or government has a monopoly on the truth, but that every individual life is infinitely precious, that every one of us put on this world has been put there for a reason and has something to offer. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is a nation made up of hundreds of nationalities. Our ties to you are more than ones of good feeling. They're ties of kinship. In <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, you'll find Russians, Armenians, Ukrainians, peoples from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. They come from every part of this vast continent, from every continent, to live in harmony, seeking a place where each cultural heritage is respected, each is valued for its diverse strengths and beauties and the richness it brings to our lives. Recently, a few individuals and families have been allowed to visit relatives in the West. We can only hope that it wo n't be long before all are allowed to do so, and Ukrainian-Americans, Baltic-Americans, Armenian-Americans can freely visit their homelands, just as this Irish-American visits his.

<TEXT>
 Freedom, it has been said, makes people selfish and materialistic. But Americans are one of the most religious peoples on earth, because they know that liberty, just as life itself, is not earned but a gift from God. They seek to share that gift with the world. `` Reason and experience,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> in his farewell address, `` both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle.'' And it is substantially true that virtue or morality is a necessary spring of popular government. Democracy is less a system of government than it is a system to keep government limited, unintrusive, a system of constraints on power to keep politics and government secondary to the important things in life, the true sources of value found only in family and faith. But I hope you know, I go on about these things not simply to extol the virtues of my own country, but to speak to the true greatness of the heart and soul of your land. Who, after all, needs to tell the land of <PERSON> Dostoyevsky </PERSON> about the quest for truth, the home of <PERSON> Kandinsky </PERSON> and <PERSON> Scriabin </PERSON> about imagination, the rich and noble culture of the Uzbek man of letters, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheer </PERSON> <PERSON> Nevoyai </PERSON>, about beauty and heart? The great culture of your diverse land speaks with a glowing passion to all humanity. Let me cite one of the most eloquent contemporary passages on human freedom. It comes not from the literature of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, but from this country, from one of the greatest writers of the 20th century, <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Pasternak </PERSON>, in the novel `` Dr. Zhivago.'' He writes: `` I think that if the beast who sleeps in man could be held down by threats, any kind of threat, whether of jail or of retribution after death, then the highest emblem of humanity would be the lion tamer in the circus with his whip, not the prophet who sacrificed himself.'' `` But this is just the point: What has for centuries raised man above the beast is not the cudgel, but an inward music, the irresistible power of unarmed truth _ the irresistible power of unarmed truth.'' Today the world looks expectedly to signs of change, steps toward greater freedom in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. We watch and we hope as we see positive changes taking place. There are some I know in your society who fear that change will bring only disruption and discontinuity, who fear to embrace the hope of the future. Sometimes it takes faith. It's like that scene in the cowboy movie, `` Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,'' which some here in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> recently had a chance to see. The posse is closing in on the two outlaws, <PERSON> Butch </PERSON> and Sundance, who find themselves trapped on the edge of a cliff with a sheer drop of hundreds of feet to the raging rapids below. Butch turns to Sundance and says their only hope is to jump into the river below. But Sundance refuses. He says he'd rather fight it out with the posse, even though they're hopelessly outnumbered. <PERSON> Butch </PERSON> says that's suicide, and urges him to jump. But Sundance still refuses, and finally admits, `` I ca n't swim.'' <PERSON> Butch </PERSON> breaks up laughing and says, `` You crazy fool. The fall will probably kill you.'' And by the way, both <PERSON> Butch </PERSON> and Sundance made it, in case you did n't see the movie. I think what I've just been talking about is perestroika and what its goals are. But change would not mean rejection of the past. Like a tree growing strong through the seasons, rooted in the earth and drawing life from the sun, so too, positive change must be rooted in traditional values _ in the land, in culture, in family and community. And it must take its life from the eternal things, from the source of all life, which is faith. Such change will lead to new understandings, new opportunities, to a broader future in which the tradition is not supplanted but finds its full flowering. That is the future beckoning to your generation. At the same time, we should remember that reform that is not institutionalized will always be insecure. Such freedom will always be looking over its shoulder. A bird on a tether, no matter how long the rope, can always be pulled back. And that is why, in my conversation with General Secretary <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, I have spoken of how important it is to institutionalize change, to put guarantees on reform. And we have been talking together about one sad reminder of a divided world: the Berlin Wall. It's time to remove the barriers that keep people apart. I am proposing an increased exchange program of high school students between our countries. General Secretary <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> mentioned on Sunday a wonderful phrase you have in Russian for this, `` Better to see something once than to hear about it a hundred times.'' Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and I first began working on this in 1985. In our discussion today, we agreed on working up to several thousand exchanges a year from each country in the near future. But not everyone can travel across the continents and oceans. Words travel lighter, and that's why we'd like to make available to this country more of our 11,000 magazines and periodicals, and our television and radio shows that can be beamed off a satellite in seconds. Nothing would please us more than for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> people to get to know us better and to understand our way of life. Just a few years ago, few would have imagined the progress our two nations have made together. The INF treaty, which General Secretary <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and I signed last December in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and whose instruments of ratification we will exchange tomorrow, the first true nuclear arms reduction treaty in history, calling for the elimination of an entire class of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet nuclear missiles.

<HEAD>MOSCOW: nuclear missiles.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 And just 16 days ago, we saw the beginning of your withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, which gives us hope that soon the fighting may end and the healing may begin, and that that suffering country may find self-determination, unity and peace at long last. It's my fervent hope that our constructive cooperation on these issues will be carried on to address the continuing destruction of conflicts in many regions of the globe, and that the serious discussions that led to the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> Accords on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> will help lead to solutions in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. I have often said nations do not distrust each other because they are armed; they are armed because they distrust each other. If this globe is to live in peace and prosper, if it is to embrace all the possibilities of technological revolution, then nations must renounce, once and for all, the right to an expansionist foreign policy. Peace between nations must be an enduring goal, not a tactical stage in a continuing conflict. I've been told that there's a popular song in your country -- perhaps you know it -- whose evocative refrain asks the question, `` Do the Russians want a war?'' In answer, it says, `` Go ask that silence lingering in the air above the birch and poplar there. Beneath those trees the soldiers lie. Go ask my mother, ask my wife. Then you will have to ask no more, do the Russians want a war?'' But what of your one-time allies? What of those who embraced you on the Elbe? What if we were to ask the watery graves of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> or the European battlefields, where <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s fallen were buried far from home? What if we were to ask their mothers, sisters and sons, do Americans want war? Ask us, too, and you'll find the same answer, the same longing in every heart. People do not make wars _ governments do. And no mother would ever willingly sacrifice her sons for territorial gain, for economic advantage, for ideology. A people free to choose will always choose peace. Americans seek always to make friends of old antagonists. After a colonial revolution with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, we have cemented for all ages the ties of kinship between our nations. After a terrible civil war between <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, we healed our wounds and found true unity as a nation. We've fought two world wars in my lifetime, against <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and one with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. But now the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germany </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> are two of our closest allies and friends. Some people point to the trade disputes between us as a sign of strength, but they're the frictions of all families, and the family of free nations is a big and vital and sometimes boisterous one. I can tell you that nothing would please my heart more than in my lifetime to see American and Soviet diplomats grappling with the problem of trade disputes between <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and a growing, exuberant, exporting <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> that it opened up to economic freedom and growth.

 And as important as these official people-to-people exchanges are, nothing would please me more than for them to become unnecessary, to see travel between East and West become so routine that university students in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> could take a month off in the summer, and, just like students in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> do now, put packs on their backs and travel from country to country in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and with barely a passport check in between. Nothing would please me more than to see the day that a concert promoter in, say, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, could call up a Soviet rock group without going through any government agency, and have them playing in <LOCATION> Liverpool </LOCATION> the next night. Is this just a dream? Perhaps, but it is a dream that is our responsibility to have come true. Your generation is living in one of the most exciting, hopeful times in Soviet history. It is a time when the first breath of freedom stirs the air, and the heart beats to the accelerated rhythm of hope when the accumulated spiritual energies of a long silence yearn to break free. I am reminded of the famous passage near the end of <PERSON> Gogol </PERSON>'s `` Dead Souls,'' comparing his nation to a speeding troika <PERSON> Gogol </PERSON> asks, `` What will be its destination?'' But he writes, `` There was no answer, save the bell pouring forth a marvelous sound.'' We do not know what the conclusion of this will be, of this journey. But we are hopeful that the promise of reform will be fulfilled. In this <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> spring, this May 1988, we may be allowed that hope, that freedom like the fresh green sapling planted over <ORGANIZATION> Tolstoy </ORGANIZATION>'s grave, will blossom forth at last in the rich fertile soil of your people and culture. We may be allowed to hope that the marvelous sound of a new openness will keep rising through, ringing through, leading to a new world of reconciliation, friendship and peace. Thank you all very much, and `` Da blagoslovit da Gospod.'' God bless you. -LRB- Applause. -RRB-

 Sunny skies, a warm breeze, temperatures around 80 and the lilacs in full bloom: <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> could hardly be lovelier. And <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has made it nicer than usual for Muscovites. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s legendary good luck and a crash cleanup by Soviet work crews combined to put the prettiest possible face on this otherwise seedy capital for the superpower summit. Even the city's notorious `` pookh,'' the cotton-wool summer scourge that falls from the city's silver poplar trees, fills the air and covers the ground like snow, has cooperated. It is having either a late season or a light one. <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Somov </PERSON>, an architect and would-be artist, was displaying his favorite painting on a downtown street when three Americans approached. One asked how much he'd take for his painting, a stylized Russian Orthodox church scene. When he discovered their nationality, however, he insisted he could n't sell his favorite work but wanted to give it to the American president. `` To Mr. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, with profound respect,'' he wrote on the back, and signed his name. The painting found its way to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s White House staff It was typical of the outpouring of goodwill that has greeted the swarm of Americans and other foreigners, mostly journalists, who have descended on <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for the meetings between Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. A 25-year-old woman standing at the edge of Red Square who identified herself as <PERSON> Olga </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> streets `` look prettier because they cleaned everything up for this summit.'' `` If only it would stay this way,'' she said. It wo n't, although the constant hosing down and sweeping of the streets is not extraordinary here. Street sweepers are undeterred even by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s frequent rainy days, but poor grading and practically nonexistent drainage ensure that the streets have almost perpetual puddles in summer. Dirt becomes mud only to be redistributed by the next storm or water truck. Some Americans, particularly those who visited <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> when relations were more strained and its people more suspicious of foreigners, have been surprised by Muscovites approaching them on the street just to practice their English or exchange pleasantries. On the Arbat, the pedestrian mall in the restored historic district that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> visited shortly after arriving Sunday, one artist displayed a mural depicting familiar <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> monuments, and in the middle was a cherubic babe holding <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> flags. The artist, who called himself <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Britikov-Cambridge </PERSON>, told a reporter: `` <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> is one of us. He's an artist.'' But if the summit has brought out a friendly comraderie in a society where people often pass on the street without acknowledging each other, it also has meant some inconvenience. Authorities announced before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> arrived that people without residence permits would not be allowed to come into the city this week, effectively banning an estimated 3 million visitors from outside the capital who crowd in on any given day to stay with relatives, shop, sell home-produced goods or search for hard-to-find commodities. Permanent residents who live near summit sites have been pleased to discover rarely found goods on store shelves that have been barren most of the winter. One shopper refused to believe that an ordinary shop was selling Danish canned ham, a rarity in the best of times, even in the hard-currency berioska stores set up for foreigners. Cars without <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> plates and those that police inspectors fear might break down and clutter the streets have been stopped at roadblocks set up at the city limits. But if the stringent controls have cut down on traffic volume, the extraordinary enthusiasm of the foot police assigned to seal off much of the city center has snarled the remaining traffic in a city which hardly has enough cars to stage a respectable rush hour. More than one driver has exercised his newfound freedom of expression to give policemen a candid opinion of a system that leads innocent motorists into a trap where all vehicles, trucks and buses included, must stop and turn around in the street to escape horrendous tieups. A <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> taxi driver who spent 20 minutes to drive less than three miles grumbled to his American passenger, `` Your president comes, and then when I want to go this way, I have to go the opposite way instead.''

 Here is the exchange on <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> during President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s question-and-answer session Tuesday at <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. The questioner refers to the presence in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> of three representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> to call attention to the problems of Indians. MODERATOR: -LRB- A question from -RRB- a student from the biological faculty: Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, I heard that a group of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> have come here because they could n't meet you in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. If you fail to meet them here, will you be able to improve, to correct it, and to meet them back in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>? PRESIDENT <PERSON> REAGAN </PERSON>: I did n't know that they had asked to see me. If they've come here, or whether to see them there, I'd be very happy to see them. Let me tell you just a little something about the American Indian in our land. We have provided millions of acres of land for what are called preservations _ or the reservations, I should say. They, from the beginning, announced that they wanted to maintain their way of life, as they had always lived there in the desert and the plains and so forth. And we set up these reservations so they could, and have a <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> to help take care of them. At the same time, we provide education for them _ schools on the reservations. And they're free also to leave the reservations and be <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens among the rest of us, and many do. Some still prefer, however, that way of _ that early way of life. And we've done everything we can to meet their demands as to what they _ how they want to live. Maybe we made a mistake. Maybe we should not have humored them in that, wanting to stay in that kind of primitive lifestyle. Maybe we should have said, `` No, come join us. Be citizens along with the rest of us.'' As I say, many have. Many have been very successful. And I'm very pleased to meet with them, talk with them at any time, and see what their grievances are or what they feel they might be And you'd be surprised, some of them became very wealthy because some of those reservations were overlaying great pools of oil. And you can get very rich pumping oil. And so I do n't know what their complaint might be.

 Wearing a wide smile, the local <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief put his arm around an American visitor and steered him into his paneled office to watch the latest TV report on the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit. `` May these sunny May days at the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> mean that a new page has been turned in the history between our countries,'' <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolstoukhov </PERSON> said at one point Tuesday. In <LOCATION> Volgograd </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Olga </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sovelyova </PERSON> picked her way through a thick crowd when she heard there was an American nearby, removed her sunglasses and extended her hand. `` I want to congratulate you on the ratification of the medium-range missile treaty by your <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>,'' said the plump 41-year-old Russian woman. `` Things are looking up for relations between us.'' For a reporter on a 1,900-mile swing through the Russian heartland, the hopes inspired by the meeting between President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> are immediately apparent because Soviets readily express them. `` I just wanted to say that we want to be friends with you,'' said a shy teen-aged girl in <LOCATION> Stavropol </LOCATION> who then left a bookstore on <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> <PERSON> Prospekt </PERSON> that among other things sells posters condemning <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> militarism. If there is a <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit appears to be playing well there. That's the case even if the hopes it inspires are tempered by memories of past swings in superpower relations and the political fact that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will be out of office in January. For most Soviets, the <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> who once joked about bombing their country has been replaced by a wiser, more sober statesman who has joined with their country's leader in seeking tighter U.S.-Soviet relations. `` He has changed,'' said <PERSON> Tolstoukhov </PERSON>, 49, party chief for a region the size of <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION> centered around the ancient city of <LOCATION> Yaroslavl </LOCATION>, 150 miles north of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` But after all, he was once a Democrat who became a Republican.'' In interviews, many people credited recent changes in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> itself for bringing <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to the capital of the socialist nation he once called an `` evil empire.'' `` As <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Sergeyevich </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> -RRB- said, ` It is better to once see than to hear 100 times,''' <PERSON> Tolstoukhov </PERSON> said. `` We hope he will sense the hospitality of our <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> people and their desire for peace.'' <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Starostin </PERSON>, mayor of <LOCATION> Stavropol </LOCATION>, said: `` We are all people and we all live on the same tiny planet. All of us want to live longer and better. The only place we should be competing is at the stadium.'' Among some Soviets, however, the hopes are twinned with suspicions fueled in part by incomplete knowledge about how the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> political system functions. A collective farmer in the village of <LOCATION> Beshpagir </LOCATION>, 25 miles from <LOCATION> Stavropol </LOCATION>, thought the lengthy debate over medium-range nuclear treaty meant the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was backing out on its commitment. `` Your president signed it: why is n't that enough?'' said the sunburned man standing outside his cottage. `` Do n't you trust us?'' But the man in his 40s who gave his name only as <PERSON> Vassily </PERSON> is an exception. Most Soviets spoke wistfully of the high-water marks in U.S.-Soviet relations _ the wartime alliance against <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the Soyuz-Apollo flight, the detente of the 1970s. Mrs. <PERSON> Sovelyova </PERSON> was among them. A guide at the monument to the World War II battle of <LOCATION> Stalingrad </LOCATION>, now called <LOCATION> Volgograd </LOCATION>, she gestured to the stone pillars that commemorate the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> soldiers who died in battle. `` We were once in a common cause,'' she said. `` Let us work together to reinforce peace on our beautiful green planet.''

<TEXT>
 Following are excerpts of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s exchange Tuesday with students at <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>: Moderator: Dear friends, Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON> has kindly agreed to answer questions, but since he does n't have too much time, only 15 minutes, so those who have questions, please ask them Q. This is a student from the history faculty, and he says that he's happy to welcome you on behalf of the students of the university. ... Do you think that it'll be possible for you and the General Secretary to get a treaty on the limitation of strategic arms during the time that you are still president? A. This is a much more complicated treaty than the INF Treaty, the intermediate-range treaty, which we have signed and which our two governments have ratified and is now in effect. So there are many things still to be settled. ... Once we had hoped that maybe, like the INF Treaty, we would have been able to sign it here at this summit meeting. It is not completed. There are still some points that are being debated. We are both hopeful that it can be finished before I leave office, which is in the coming January. But I assure you that if it is n't ... I will have impressed on my successor that we must carry on until it is signed. My dream has always been that once we've started down this road, we can look forward to a day, you can look forward to a day, when there will be no more nuclear weapons in the world at all -LRB- Applause. -RRB- Q. The student wonders how the youths have changed since the days when you were a student, up till now. A. Well, I know there was a period in our country when there was a very great change for the worst. When I was governor of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, I could start a riot just by going to a campus. But that has all changed, and I could be looking out at an American student body as well as I'm looking out here, and would not be able to tell the difference between you. I did happen to go to school and get my college education in a unique time. It was the time of the Great Depression, when, in a country like our own, there was 25 percent unemployment and the bottom seemed to fall out of everything. I think what maybe I should be telling you, from my point here, because I graduated in 1932, that ... you know an awful lot more about being young than you do about being old. And I think there is a seriousness, I think there's a sense of responsibility that young people have, and I think that there's an awareness on the part of most of you about what you want ... your adulthood to be and what the country you live in, you want it to be. And I have a great deal of faith. I said the other day to ... 76 students _ they were half <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and half Russian _ I believe if all the young people of the world today could get to know each other, there would never be another war. Q. Mr. President, you have just mentioned that you welcome the efforts aimed at the settlement of the Afghani question, and it might promote the settlement of other regional conflicts. What conflicts do you mean _ Central American conflicts, Southeast Asian, or South African? A. Well, for example, in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> has been promised its independence as a nation, ... it is impossible because of a civil war going on in another country there. And that civil war is being fought on one side by some 30,000 to 40,000 Cuban troops who have gone from the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION> over there and are fighting on one side with one kind of authoritative government. ... But what we believe is that those foreign soldiers should get out and let them settle it, let them, the citizens of that nation, settle their problems. And the same is true in ... <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> ... had a dictator. There There was an organization that then was aided by others in the revolution. And they appealed to the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for help in getting the dictator to step down, stop the killing _ and he did. But the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> had asked, `` What are the goals of the revolution?'' And they were given in writing. And they were the goals of a pluralistic society, of the right of unions, and freedom of speech and press, and so forth, and free elections. And then the one group that was the best organized among the revolutionaries seized power, exiled many of the other leaders, and has its own government, which violated every one of the promises that had been made. And, here again, ... we're trying to encourage the ... making of those promises come true and letting the people of that particular country decide their fate. Q. I am very much anxious and concerned about the destiny of 310 Soviet soldiers missing in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Can you, are you willing to help in their search and their return to the motherland? A. Very much so. We would like nothing better than that. Q. The realization of the unalienable right of citizens guaranteed by the Constitution faces certain problems. For example, the right of people to have arms. Or, for example, ... whether a spread of pornography or narcotics is compatible with these rights. Do you believe that these problems just are unavoidable problems connected with democracies or they could be avoided? A. If I understand you correctly, ... does that include the right to do criminal acts and, for example, in the use of drugs and so forth? No. -LRB- Laughter, applause. -RRB- No. We have a set of laws. ... Our Constitution is a document in which `` we the people'' tell the government what its powers are. ... But very carefully, at the same time, the people give the government the power with regard to those things which they think would be destructive to society. ... The government can enforce the laws, but that has all been dictated by the people.

 Q. Since your term of office is coming to an end, what sentiment do you experience and whether you feel like if, hypothetically, you can just stay for another term? A. There has kind of grown a tradition in our country about two terms. ... It was just a tradition, and then <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> ran the four times, died very early in his fourth term. And suddenly, in the atmosphere at that time, they added an amendment to the Constitution that presidents could only serve two terms. When I get out of office I'm going to travel around ... and try to convince the people of our country that they should wipe out that amendment to the Constitution because it was an interference with the democratic rights of the people. The people should be allowed to vote for who they wanted to vote for as many times as they want to vote for them, and that it is they who are being denied a right. -LRB- Applause. -RRB- In <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, when I was there, if you did n't sing or dance, you wound up as an after-dinner speaker. And I did n't sing or dance. So I have a hunch that I will be out on the speaking circuit, telling about a few things that I did n't get done in government but urging the people to tell the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> they wanted them done. -LRB- Applause. -RRB- Q. I heard that a group of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> have come here because they could n't meet you in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. If you fail to meet them here, will you be able to ... correct it and to meet them back in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>? A. I did n't know that they had asked to see me. ... I'd be very happy to see them. They from the beginning announced that they wanted to maintain their way of life. ... And we set up these reservations so they could, and have a <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> to help take care of them. At the same time, we provide ... schools on the reservations. And they're free also to leave the reservations and be <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens among the rest of us, and many do. Some still prefer, however, that ... early way of life. Maybe we made a mistake. Maybe we should not have humored them in that wanting to stay in that kind of primitive lifestyle. Maybe we should have said, `` No, come join us. Be citizens along with the rest of us.'' I'm very pleased to meet with them, talk with them at any time, and see what their grievances are or what they feel they might be. And you'd be surprised, some of them became very wealthy because some of those reservations were overlaying great pools of oil. And you can get very rich pumping oil. And so I do n't know what their complaint might be. Q. Why did you receive yesterday ... just refuseniks or dissidents? Just what are your impressions from <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> people? A. You have to realize that we are a people that are made up of every strain, nationality and race of the world. And the result is that when people in our country think someone is being mistreated or treated unjustly in another country, these are people who still feel that kinship to that country because that is their heritage. What I have brought to the General Secretary, and I must say he has been very cooperative about it, I have brought lists of names that have been brought to me that are from people that are relatives or friends that ... believe that this individual is being mistreated here in this country, and they want them to be allowed to emigrate to our country. Some are separated families. Now, I'm not blaming you. I'm blaming bureaucracy. We have the same type of thing happen in our own country, and every once in while somebody has to get the bureaucracy by the neck and shake it loose and say, `` Stop doing what you're doing.'' Moderator. -LRB- Makes comment in Russian followed by applause. -RRB- A. Thank you very much. -LRB- Applause -RRB- You are all very kind. ... Nobody asked me what it was going to feel like to not be president anymore. I have some understanding because after I'd been governor for eight years and then stepped down, ... we'd only been home a few days and someone invited us out to dinner. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> and I both went out, got in the back seat of the car and waited for somebody to get in the front and drive us.

 `` Drink to Me Only with Thine Eyes,'' premiered by American Ballet Theater on Tuesday night at the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opera </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, is a pleasing, light-hearted dance, the first choreographed for the company by <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, who heads his own modern dance group, succeeds here by being interesting but not pushing cleverness too far and being inventive but not pushing that either. The mood of the dancing fit the mood of each of the 13 sections of music, from <PERSON> Virgil </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomson </PERSON>'s `` Etudes for Piano.'' Pianist <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Boriskin </PERSON> played a grand piano at the stage's rear center. <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON> danced but there is no `` star'' part. There was much coming and going. There were touches of humor, as when a dancer would enter at one side, dance straight across the stage and exit, or when dancers would enter, make a U-turn and return immediately to the wings. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> sometimes repeated images, like having the women clasp their hands over their heads and lean back against their partner's arm He would walk around in a circle, partly carrying the ballerina's weight, with her pivoting on one toe. When <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON> did solo figures, they were often turns, alternating clockwise and counterclockwise. He also skipped lightly, as well as doing regulation balletic jumps and turns in air. Three women danced a section where the center ballerina's legs were moving together while the other two ballerinas' legs were moving apart, all looking like an optical illusion. They concluded with a formal pose. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> native, choreographed for the opera `` <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' as well as for the <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opera </ORGANIZATION> presentations of `` Orpheus and Eurydice'' and `` Die Fledermaus.'' Next fall the <ORGANIZATION> Mark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> will become the resident dance company of the <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> theater, which formerly housed <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Bejart </PERSON>'s Ballet of the 20th Century. Also on Tuesday's program at the Met were <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON>'s staging of `` Grand Pas Classique'' from `` Raymonda'' and the lavish production of <PERSON> Leonide </PERSON> <PERSON> Massine </PERSON>'s `` Gaite Parisienne,'' which is new this season.

 Here is a transcript of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s remarks Tuesday to members of the cultural and arts community at the House of Artists. Well, as <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> VIII </PERSON> said to each of his six wives, `` I wo n't keep you long. -LRB- Laughter -RRB- Thank you <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasilovich </PERSON>. It's with some humility that I come here today. You here, writers, artists, dramatists, musicians of this vast country, are heirs to the seminal figures in many of the arts as they have developed in the 20th century <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. I'm thinking of such giants as <PERSON> Kandinsky </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stravinsky </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stanislavsky </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dostoyevsky </PERSON>, to name a few men whose vision transformed all of ours. I've been very impressed with what I've heard just now. For my contribution to this dialogue I thought I would deal here briefly with a question whose answer might open up some new insights for all of us. You see, I've been told that many of you were puzzled that a former actor could become the leader of a great nation, particularly the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. What does acting have to do with politics and statecraft? Whatever possessed the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people to entrust this high office to me? You might feel reassured to know that you are n't the first to ask that question. Back in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> just about every member of the political opposition has been asking it for the last eight years. And they're not the first; it's been happening ever since. Almost a quarter of a century ago I announced that I was going to run for what turned out to be the first public office I ever held _ governor of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Yes, I had served as president of my union, the Screen Actors Guild; yes, in that role I'd led a successful strike by the union against the studios; and yes, I had campaigned actively for a number of candidates for office, including candidates for president. But I was still known primarily as an actor. In the movie business actors often get what we call `` type cast.'' That is, the studios come to think of you as playing certain kinds of roles, so those are the kinds of roles they give you. And no matter how hard you try, you just ca n't get them to think of you in any other way. Well politics is a little like that too. So I've had a lot of time and reason to think about my role, not just as a citizen turned politician, but as an actor turned politician. In looking back, I believe acting did prepare me for the work I do now. There are two things, two indispensable lessons that I've taken from my craft into public life And I hope you wo n't think it excessive opportune if I use the words of a Soviet filmmaker to explain one of them. He was, after all, one of the world's greatest filmmakers. And so, like so many of your artists, indeed, like so many of you, belongs, in a broader sense, to all of humanity. It was during the production of `` Ivan the Terrible,'' when <PERSON> Eisenstein </PERSON> noted that in making a film, or in thinking through any detail of it _ which, to my mind, the acting of a part _ in his words, `` The most important thing is to have the vision. The next is to grasp and hold it. You must see and feel what you are thinking. You must see and grasp it. You must hold and fix it in your memory and senses. And you must do it at once.'' To grasp and hold a vision, to fix it in your senses, that is the very essence, I believe, of successful leadership. Not only on the movie set, where I learned about it, but everywhere. And, by the way, in my many dealings with him since he became general secretary, I've found that Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has the ability to grasp and hold a vision and I respect him for that. The second lesson I carried from acting into public life was more subtle. And let me again refer to a Soviet artist, a poet, again, one of the world's greatest. At the beginning of `` Requiem'' <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhmatova </PERSON> writes of standing in a line outside a prison when someone in the crowd recognizes her as a well-known poet. She continues, `` Then a woman standing behind me, whose lips were blue with cold, and who naturally enough, had never even heard of my name, emerged from that state of torpor common to us all, and putting her lips close to my ear _ there everyone spoke in whispers _ asked me, ` And could you describe this?' And I answered her, ` I can.' Then something vaguely like a smile flashed across what once had been her face.'' That exchange, `` Can you describe this? I can.'' is at the heart of acting, as it is of poetry and of so many of the arts. You get inside a character, a place, and a moment. You come to know the character in that instant, not as an abstraction, one of the people, one of the masses, but as a particular person yearning, hoping, fearing, loving, a face, even what had once been a face apart from all others. And you convey that knowledge. You describe it. You describe the face.

<TEXT>
 Pretty soon, at least for me, it becomes harder and harder to force any member of humanity into a straight-jacket, into some rigid form in which you all expect to fit. In acting, even as you develop an appreciation for what we call the dramatic, you become in a more intimate way less taken with superficial pomp and circumstance, more attentive to the core of the soul _ that part of each of us that God holds in the hollow of His hand, and into which He breaths the breath of life. And you come to appreciate what another of your poets, <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Gumilov </PERSON> meant when he wrote that `` the eternal entrance to God's paradise is not closed with seven diamond seals. It is a doorway in a wall abandoned long ago _ stones, moss and nothing more.'' As I see it, political leadership in a democracy requires seeing past the adstractions and embracing the vast diversity of humanity, and doing it with humility; listening as best you can, not just to those with high positions, but to the cacophonous voices of ordinary people, and trusting those millions of people, keeping out of their way; not trying to act the all-wise and all-powerful; not letting government act that way. And the word we have for this is `` freedom.'' In the last few years freedom for the arts has been expanded in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Some poems, books, music, and works in other fields that were once banned, have been made available to the public and some of those artists who produced them have been recognized. Two weeks ago, because of the work of the writers' union, the first step was taken to make the <PERSON> Pasternak </PERSON> home at <LOCATION> Peredelkino </LOCATION> into a museum In the meantime, some artists in exile, the stage director <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubimov </PERSON>, for example, have been permitted to return and to work. And artists who are here have been allowed a greater range. We in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> applaud the new thaw in the arts. We hope to see it go further. We hope to see <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Slava </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostropovich </PERSON> _ artists Mrs. and I have seen perform in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> _ perform again in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. We hope to see the works of <PERSON> Aleksandr </PERSON> <PERSON> Solzhenitsyn </PERSON> published in the land he loves. And we hope to see a permanent end to the restrictions on the creativity of all artists and writers. We want this, not just for your sake, but for our own. We believe that the greater the freedoms in other countries, the more secure both our own freedoms and peace. And we believe that when the arts in any country are free to blossom, the lives of all people are richer. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Faulkner </PERSON> said of poets _ although he could have been speaking of any of the arts _ `` It is the poet's privilege to help man endure by lifting his heart, by reminding him of the courage and honor and hope and pride and compassion and pity and sacrifice, which have been the glory of our past. The poet's voice need not merely be the record of man, it can be one of the props, the pillars to help him endure and prevail.'' Thank you for having me here today, and for sharing your thoughts with me. And God bless you all.

 Here is a transcript of Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s toast Tuesday at the dinner President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> hosted at the home of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador: Esteemed Mr. President, esteemed Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, ladies and gentlemen, comrades: I thank you, Mr. President for the words of greeting you've just addressed to us. Two great nations have given the two of us a mandate to determine what Soviet-American relations should be like. Since our first meeting in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, relations between our two countries have overcome a long, drawn-out period of confrontation to reach an acceptable level from it which it is now easier to move forward. In <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and during this present visit of yours, our dialogue has been intense. It's most important result has been the now-ratified first treaty to reduce nuclear weapons A search is continuing to find a solution for problems relating to 50 percent cuts in strategic offensive arms. The Geneva Accord on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> has come into force. We now have as many as 47 bilateral agreements on cooperation. The visit by a president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is an occasion for a glance at the past, and a look into the future. The history of relations between our two countries has known all kinds of things, good and bad. Of the good things, we remember particularly well the Soviet-American comradeship in arms in World War II. Those grim years saw the emergence of the first shoots of Soviet-American friendship. And there was not one single Soviet citizen who did not feel bitter when that glorious page in the history of our relations gave way to Cold War. That was a hard test for our peoples. The world found itself in a dangerous situation. We all felt the breath of impending catastrophe. Even today, we're sometimes chilled by cold winds. But world developments, in their main tendency, are turning toward a search for political solutions, toward cooperation and peace. We are, all of us, witnesses to momentous changes, though a lot still has to be done to achieve irreversible change. Although everything urges cooperation and trust, prejudices and stereotypes are still with us, as is rivalry, above all in the military sphere. A great deal has been said at this meeting too about how pointless and catastrophic it is. More importantly, we can register some headway toward better mutual understanding in this area as well. Today, I would like to address another major world problem _ the situation in the developing world, which can not but affect our countries, too. The problems which the developing countries face have turned out to be difficult to the point of tragedy. Glaring backwardness, hunger, poverty and mass diseases continue to beset entire nations, and incredibly high debt has become an excruciating and universal problem. It would seem that everybody can see its complexity, involving as it does extremely diverse and truly vital interests, and understand that a way out must be sought. We believe that if the international community, and above all the great powers, are to be of any help, the starting point and the essential thing is to recognize unconditionally the freedom of choice. We are insisting on fairness. We have seriously studied the economic situation in developing nations, and I am convinced that a way out is possible along the lines of a radical restructuring of the entire system of world economic relations without any discrimination for political reasons. This would promote a political settlement of regional conflicts which not only impede progress in that part of the world, but also cause turmoil in the entire world situation. With such an approach, our differences as to what kind of a future awaits the Third World would not take on confrontational forms. So in this matter too, our relationship is doomed to have an international dimension. Turning now to our bilateral relations, we envision their opportunities and prospects primarily in the light of internal evolution in both countries, but also in the context of world developments. Many Americans who are studying us and who have visited the <ORGANIZATION> USSR </ORGANIZATION>, and now, I hope, those present here as well, have been able to see for themselves the sweeping scope of change in our country. It is based on comprehensive democratization and radical economic reform. I am gratified to note that today the president and I have had an in-depth exchange of views on this subject. We have also discussed our perestroika a number of times with other Americans. This is all to the good. It, too, is a sign of change in our relationship. We, for our part, are trying to closely follow the profound trends in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. We see how little similarity there is between what is happening in our country and in yours, in two very different societies based on different values. But we do not regard this as an obstacle to identifying promising areas for mutually beneficial ties or for cooperation in the interests of the two peoples. We're in favor of competition and comparison. And another thing, whatever the ups and downs of our dialogue with <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, Soviet representatives have been upholding the interests of the Soviet state. In their contacts with us, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials have been acting in exactly the same way, vis-a-vis their own interests. The truth is, that in building their relationship, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can effectively serve their own interests only if they have a realistic view and take account of each other's interests and intentions. We must learn the difficult art of not just existing side by side, but of building bridges of mutually beneficial cooperation. Soviet and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people want to live in peace and communicate in all areas in which they have a mutual interest. The interest is theirs, and it is growing. We feel no fear. We are not prejudiced. We believe in the value of communication. I ee a future in which the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> base their relations on disarmament, a balance of interest and comprehensive cooperation, rather than on deterring each other or upgrading their military capabilities. I see a future in which solutions to real problems are not impeded by problems historically outdated or artificially kept alive, inherited from the times of the Cold War, and in which the policies of confrontation give way to a joint quest based on reason, mutual benefit, and readiness to compromise. I see a future in which our two countries, without claiming any special rights in the world, are always mindful of their special responsibility in a community of equal nations. It will be a world that is safer and more secure, which is so badly needed by all people on earth, by their children and grandchildren, so that they can gain and preserve the basic human rights _ the right to life, work, freedom, and the pursuit of happiness. The path towards this future can be neither easy nor short. We may be standing at the threshold of a uniquely interesting period in the history of our two nations. This new meeting between the two of us, Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, confirms that three years ago in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, we took the right decision. May the years to come bring a healthier international environment. May life be triumphant. To the very good health of the president, to the very good health of Mrs. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, to cooperation between our two peoples.

 Here is a transcript of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s toast at a dinner Tuesday honoring Soviet leader and Mrs. <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The general secretary and I had already held three meetings before this one began here in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Each of those earlier encounters took place in the autumn. The days were growing short, the weather ever grayer and colder. It makes for a bracing, delightful change to have this meeting take place at the high point of spring, a time of long, light-filled days. I know that <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> found her springtime visit to <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> earlier today both magnificent and moving. The play of light upon the rivers and canals added the special splendor of the season to a city splendid in any season. And everywhere, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> has told me, there was a sense of history, especially of <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>'s immense courage and sacrifice during the Second World War, surely one of the most stirring epics in the whole human story. Here in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, I have been reminded a number of times during this springtime visit of a passage in a book about your country by <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> vanderPost. Especially struck by the city's churches, vanderPost wrote that when he caught his first sight of the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> skyline, he saw `` the light of an unusually pure evening upon it. That light was alchemical, and it transformed <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> into a city of gold, the tops of the spires and pinnacles drawing the rigid forms of the skyscrapers after them into arrows of gold aimed at the arched and timeless blue.'' So we, too, have found a city of beauties, a city especially whose pinnacles and spires reminded one at virtually every turn of man's ancient capacity for aspiration, for reaching out toward the light. It's a particular pleasure to be able to welcome you to <ORGANIZATION> Spaso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, a house of considerable beauty in its own right, the residence of our ambassadors to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. During the 55 years of diplomatic relations between our two nations, <ORGANIZATION> Spaso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> has served as one of the principal settings for exchanges between us, exchanges formal and informal alike. There've been some splendid moments within these walls. <PERSON> Prokofiev </PERSON> once conducted his marvelous, `` The Love for Three Oranges,'' in this very room. As wartime allies, our representatives met often under this roof, and Ambassador and Mrs. <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON> have continued the tradition of making <ORGANIZATION> Spaso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> a centerpiece of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> culture, a place to receive and talk with Soviet officials, and with people from all walks of life and from all parts of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. But, there have also been quiet times in this house _ unnaturally quiet times _ times when difficult relations between us meant that this house, this huge magnificent house, stood virtually empty of visitors. I'm told that it was even possible to hear the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> metro rumbling past ever so faintly deep in the earth below. Mr. General Secretary, we know that on matters of great importance, we will continue to differ profoundly, and yet, you and I have met four times now, more often than any previous president and general secretary. While our discussions have sometimes been pointed or contentious, we possess an enlarged understanding of each other and of each other's country. On specific matters of policy, we have made progress, often historic progress. And perhaps most important, we have committed our nations to continuing to work together, agreeing that silence must never again be permitted to fall between us. We have agreed always to continue the interchanges between our nations because, I believe, we both hear the same voice, the same overwhelming imperative. What that voice says can be expressed in many ways, but I've found it in vivid form in <PERSON> Pasternak </PERSON>'s poem, `` The Garden of <LOCATION> Gethsemane </LOCATION>.'' Listen, if you will, to <PERSON> Pasternak </PERSON>'s account of that famous arrest. There appeared, no one knew from where, a crowd of slaves and a rabble of knaves with lights and swords, and leading them, <PERSON> Judas </PERSON> with a traitor's kiss upon his lips. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> repulsed the ruffians with his sword, and cut off the ear of one of them, but he heard, you can not decide a dispute with weapons. Put your sword in its place, o man. That's the voice: Put your sword in its place, o man. That is the imperative, the command. And so, we will work together, that we might forever keep our swords at our sides. Mr. General Secretary, ladies and gentlemen, <ORGANIZATION> Spaso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> has, as I've said, seen quiet times, yet the animated conversation of this evening has already done much to make up for them. And so, I would like to raise a glass _ a glass to the continued interchange between our two nations, and if I may, to Spaso House itself, as a symbol of our relations. May this lovely home never lack for visitors and shared meals and the sounds of spirited conversation, and even the peal of hearty laughter. Thank you, and <PERSON> God </PERSON> bless you, to the general secretary, to Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, to the relationship that I believe must continue.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> says he does `` not foresee confrontation'' at the Democratic National Convention although he is considering challenges on a range of issues from platform planks to the status of `` super delegates.'' In an interview Tuesday, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s convention manager said the candidate expects to `` have a significant impact on the platform itself, not just some minority reports.'' <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer and party activist, said there was `` great concern among Democrats over what <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>'s core constituency does in the general election.'' Black voters, who provided the base of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s support in primaries and caucuses, have voted overwhelmingly Democratic in recent presidential elections. But there now is concern within the party over whether those voters will turn out in large numbers if they believe <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was shortchanged at the party convention in July. After meeting Sunday with black supporters, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the likely party presidential nominee, said: `` I do n't see any deep divisions, philosophically, ideologically, on the issues. I do n't see any of that. We're going to have as united a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> as we've ever had.'' Campaigning in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> on Monday, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, `` I do not foresee confrontation. We can effectively negotiate on mutually respectful terms.'' But he also held out the possibility of floor fights over platform issues. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has `` become in effect the leader of the progressive part of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'' and he added that the enthusiasm his supporters would show for a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> candidacy would depend `` not only on what <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> does and how he is treated but he is perceived to have been treated.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> expects to play `` a strong role'' in the selection of the party's vice presidential nominee, although he does not anticipate having veto power over that choice. When asked whether he would accept second place on a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ticket, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, `` I've earned consideration.'' While saying he did not believe <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> expected to have a veto power over the vice presidential candidate, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said he thought selection of Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> `` would not be a great signal'' to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporters. On the other hand, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> `` has not indicated he expects to have a blackball of any candidate _ that's not a view I've heard expressed by him at all.'' By limiting their count to only elected committed delegates, the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign is arguing that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will not have a delegate majority when the convention convenes in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> in July. `` We count ` super delegates' as uncommitted until they cast their vote on the ballot for president,'' said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. Super delegates are party and elected officials who became automatic, uncommitted delegates outside the primary and caucus process. The role of super delegates in choosing Democratic presidential nominees will be one of the major issues raised by the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> forces at the convention, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` We want to get the party to look at the general fairness or lack thereof of the process,'' he said. `` There ought to be some nexus between the popular vote and delegate strength,'' added <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. `` Who said the purpose of super delegates is to flock to the front-runner?'' Many of the 1988 super delegates have been flocking to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Even though <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> finished first or second in 36 primaries and caucuses this year, `` not a single governor, not a single senator, not a single state party chair _ with the exception of the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> _ has declared support for him,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. He said a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> challenge to the role of super delegates would be more likely to apply to future conventions than the 1988 gathering.

<HEAD>Guerrillas Capture Strategic Valley Used By Soviets To Withdraw</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN WILDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Guerrillas have wrested control of the valley through which Soviet troops are withdrawing from <LOCATION> Afghaninstan </LOCATION> but are sparing the retreating <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, Western diplomats and guerrilla officials say. The sources, who spoke Tuesday, gave credence to reports that a deal had been struck between a guerrilla commander and the Kremlin's army allowing Soviet soldiers to leave <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> if they do so peacefully. The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also reported rumors of an imminent military coup in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and said the Soviets have been giving the Afghan army more sophisticated gear than before. The gear includes Soviet-built AN-12 transports, jets comparable to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Turbo-prop C-130 Hercules, large bombs, infrared nightsighting devices for small arms and new radar equipment. The anti-communist guerrillas are apparently also getting their share of top-notch weaponry. Official Afghan television showed pictures of a new long-range rocket captured south of the city. The rocket has a range of about 12 miles and is believed to come from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, while acknowledging it supplies the guerrillas, rarely discloses details of arms shipments. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> also arm the guerrillas. Meanwhile, the insurgents were reported to have stepped up rocket attacks on <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, a possible indication they are getting stronger and drawing nearer to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s center of power. Diplomats citing dispatches from the capital said 14 rockets slammed into the city, mainly into its western and southern districts, from May 23-30. That was the heaviest missile attack on <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> in any week this year. Several Western military analysts, all speaking on condition of anonymity, say guerrillas are now operating within six to 12 miles of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, which is on a plain ringed by hills. On Tuesday, the Soviet withdrawal continued as <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops evacuated towns south of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> in their second major retreat from Afghan outposts. Western and Soviet diplomatic sources in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> said <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> troops left <LOCATION> Ghazni </LOCATION>, 85 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Gardez </LOCATION>, 60 miles south of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, and were heading north toward the Soviet border. The evacuation of Soviet troops from the area leaves the Afghan army largely unassisted, at least on the ground, against attacks by anti-government guerrillas in the provinces separating <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> from the Pakistani border to the south and southeast. On Tuesday, the guerrillas said from their headquarters in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> that they captured the strategic <LOCATION> Panjshir </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> northeast of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> last Thursday. Diplomats in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> supported the claim. The <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> highway, the major Soviet withdrawal route, runs through the valley, but the insurgents say they are letting the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> pass without attacking. Recent reports said the guerrilla commander <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Masood </PERSON> made a deal with the Soviet military to leave its troops alone if they retreat peacefully. <PERSON> Masood </PERSON> has made such deals in the past, but only at a price. It is not known what concessions he may have extracted from the Soviets. The Soviet withdrawal started May 15 with departure of troops from <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, 75 miles east of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. Under an April agreement signed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, the Soviets are to complete their withdrawal by Feb. 15, 1989. When the pullout began, the Soviets had an estimated 115,000 soldiers in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. About 10,000 have left so far, according to reports from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The Soviet military intervention in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> began in December 1979 when troops were dispatched to prop up a Soviet-style government in the face of escalating guerrilla attacks. Sources in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> said speculation has been rife about a possible military coup when President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> leaves the country for 10 days beginning Saturday. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> will be going to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and is also scheduled to speak at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Speculation focuses on the Khalq faction of the governing <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The faction dominates the police and military. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parcham </ORGANIZATION> wing also is split in two: his supporters and those of former leader <PERSON> Babrak </PERSON> <PERSON> Karmal </PERSON>.

 A man convicted of soliciting a murder contract through <ORGANIZATION> Soldier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fortune </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> has been sentenced to a 40-year prison term. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> received the maximum prison term for the crime from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> DeAnda </PERSON> on Monday. Savage is already serving a 40-year term in a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> federal prison for arranging the beating death of the former assistant city manager of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. The latest sentence would follow that term and a consecutive 25-year sentence in a federal prison in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> on a conviction for attempted murder-for-hire and threatening a witness. <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, 39, was convicted April 6 on charges he masterminded the bungled bombing of <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Free </PERSON>'s home in October 1985. Savage of <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, ran a `` gun for hire'' advertisement in Soldier of Fortune magazine in June 1985. <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brado </PERSON>, a terminally ill <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> widow, pleaded guilty to paying Savage $ 20,000 to kill Free, her former business partner. Ms. <PERSON> Brado </PERSON>, who later died in prison, said she wanted Free dead because he bilked her out of her life savings of $ 300,000. Free was not at his <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> area home at the time of the bombing. He also escaped two previous attempts to bomb his car in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. Savage was tried in <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> after <PERSON> DeAnda </PERSON> ruled the defendant could not get a fair trial in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> because of publicity from an unrelated civil suit against Soldier of Fortune. In that case, a federal jury awarded $ 9.4 million to the family of a woman killed after an ad ran in the magazine.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> says he plans to become an after-dinner and luncheon speaker afer he leaves office and that he'll try to convince the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people to rescind the two-term limits on presidents. The 22nd Amendment, which prescribes that limit, was ratified by the states in 1951. `` It was an interference with the democratic rights of the people,'' he told students at <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday during a question and answer session. `` The people should be allowed to vote for who they wanted to vote for as many times as they want to vote for them.'' The reply, which drew applause, was in answer to a question of whether <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would like a third term. The president explained that a tradition of two-term presidents had grown up since <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> refused a third tirm because he did n't want to foster a monarchy. He said the amendment passed because of `` the atmosphere of the time.'' `` I think it was kind of a revenge against <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Delano </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> who was elected four times,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told the students. He said when he leaves office he'll travel around the mashed potato circuit `` and try to convince the people of our country that they should wipe out that amendment to the Constitution.'' The president said, `` I ca n't do this while I'm in office because it'll look as if I'm selfishly doing it for myself. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said that on the speaking circuit he'll tell `` about a few things that I did n't get done in government, but urging the people to tell the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> they wanted them done.''

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> intends to campaign extensively in the weeks following the June 7 end of the primary season, traveling to the South, West and <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> as well as tending to the business of selecting a running mate and preparing for the Democratic National Convention. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor also plans to make a speech on U.S.-Soviet relations a day or two after President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> wraps up his <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit, according to aides. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who expects to clinch the party's presidential nomination in the final round of primaries next week, said in an interview that he anticipates making a quick campaign swing with his vice presidential running mate shortly after the convention. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> declined to comment further on his selection of a vice presidential candidate, although he acknowledged he has been advised by members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and others to pick someone who is regarded as a moderate or conservative to help reassure voters in the South and West. `` I'm not looking for a clone of myself,'' he said. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor shrugged off <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s recent criticisms that he is too conservative, saying, `` I do n't see any deep division'' that would mar the unity of the party's convention. `` I do n't see anything that ca n't be resolved,'' he said. In the meantime, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' aides are converting as many delegates as they can. Campaign sources said as many as 25 <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> delegates pledged to dropout candidates <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> may enlist, perhaps as early as today. Other such converts could come from <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, and the campaign is trying to win over some of Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> delegates. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' comments came as fresh public opinion polls show him running ahead of Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the locked-in Republican nominee. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he believes his success thus far is due in part to the `` steady, consistent'' campaign he has run, but also because `` there really is a strong desire for change.'' `` The cycle has come around here,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his aides have begun to direct their energies toward the fall campaign, even as they go about wrapping up the delegates needed to clinch the nomination. They have hired a new press secretary, <PERSON> Dayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>, and expect to add an additional speechwriter to the staff shortly. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> hopes to use the five weeks between the end of the primaries and the convention to get off to an early start against <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ and keep the focus on the issues they want to raise and not on the ins and outs of the vice presidential selection process. `` They will be a couple of highly thematic trips in which we will do our best to get you guys to do something other than political horserace stories,'' said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Edley </PERSON>, the campaign's issues director `` Something to keep the campaign themes in the eye of the voters.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> frequently says that he does not intend to concede any states to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the fall, and <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dach </PERSON>, the campaign's communications director, said one purpose of the pre-convention traveling is to reinforce the impression that `` we can win electoral votes in every region of the country. Aides said the first extended trip is a Southern swing the week following the end of the primary season in which <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will speak about drugs and crime issues. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> tentatively plans stops in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, including a visit to the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democratic Convention on June 18. That will mark his second trip to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> since the state's primary on March 8 _ he attended a huge barbecue with the state's <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> hierarchy last week _ and apparently reflects a decision to campaign hard in the state where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> got his political start. A trip is tentatively being planned for the end of June to key industrial states, perhaps <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, in which <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will address economic issues. The governor is expected to travel to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> sometime around July 4, and a trip to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and perhaps one other <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> state is being planned. In addition, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> may travel to <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to address the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayors </ORGANIZATION> the week after the primaries, and also may make a quick trip to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on June 22 to speak to a convention of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> union. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will spend the balance of his time working in his statehouse office. He envisions `` three days a week in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> doing my job during the day, and having the evenings free for briefings, discussions on everything from the platform to general issues to a running mate.'' The governor also has set aside time for a vacation with his wife <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> during June, most likely on <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION>.

 The research ship Atlantis II, seized under the federal zero-tolerance drug policy, was allowed to set sail for <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> but must keep authorities posted on its whereabouts. The ship, which took part in the exploration of the wreck of the Titanic, left its moorage here Tuesday, said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Atlantis II remains under `` constructive seizure,'' which means that ship officials must report the craft's position to customs officials at least once a week, said Capt. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiljean </PERSON>. <PERSON> Chiljean </PERSON>, who was not the captain when the seizure took place, said Monday the release of the 210-foot vessel was based in part on an agreement that `` this would never happen again.'' The ship, worth an estimated $ 30 million, is now bound for exploration off the <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> coast. The stop in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> was a planned one for overhaul of equipment, <PERSON> Chiljean </PERSON> said, and the ship remains on schedule. Customs officials seized Atlantis II on May 18 after finding a tiny bit of marijuana and some residue in a pipe owned by a crew member. The ship was returning with a <ORGANIZATION> Scripps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanography </ORGANIZATION> vessel from an exploration off the coast of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The seizure was one of the most publicized of the zero-tolerance program, a federal crackdown in which officials are confiscating boats or vehicles for discovery of any amount of drugs. Protest of the policy, including a congressional attack on it last week, led to a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> decision to use more discretion in deciding whether to seize vessels. Ships outside the 12-mile territorial limit will be taken only if intent to smuggle is determined.

 A study has found that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> death toll from a major hurricane could be far worse than previously predicted, the head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday to mark the opening of the 1988 <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> storm season. Recently completed hurricane coastal flood models for the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> and Gulf coasts show that many more people than earlier thought must be evacuated under certain conditions, said center director <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheets </PERSON>. Forty-three million people live in about 175 coastal counties from <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and evacuating crowded urban areas and barrier islands is virtually impossible, Sheets said. There are not enough shelters to handle the added load and there are serious concerns how new glass-windowed high-rises would fare if lashed by hurricane-force winds during evacuations, he said. During a hurricane that struck <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, `` glass was flying everywhere,'' said Sheets. He refused to make predictions about the 1988 hurricane season, saying no one has convinced forecasters they can reliably predict the number and severity of storms. The first tropical depression of the year has formed, and remained stationary Tuesday night just south of the western tip of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, or about 200 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>. The system contained winds of up to 30 mph and was not expected to strengthen. One of the two satellites used to keep track of hurricanes could fail this year, forecasters said. `` It's quite possible this year that we could lose GOES-West at anytime,'' hurricane specialist <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Case </PERSON> said of the Geo-Stationary Earth-Orbiting Environmental Satellite, which records atmospheric conditions over the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> and part of the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>. If that satellite does stop working, GOES-East would have to be directed to move from its equatorial orbit over <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> to a spot south of the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, where it would provide a view of the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION> with limited vision in the hurricane-spawning eastern <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>, he said. A previous GOES-East expired in 1984 and temporarily deprived meteorologists of <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> atmospheric photographs. A typical <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> hurricane season, from June 1 to Nov. 30, has 10 named tropical storms with rain and maximum sustained wind exceeding 39 mph, six of which become hurricanes with drenching rain and wind over 74 mph, <PERSON> Case </PERSON> said. In 1987 there were only three hurricanes and four tropical storms in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>. Hurricane Emily slammed into the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> on Sept. 22, causing three deaths with wind gusts up to 110 mph. It recovered enough punch to belt <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION> with 116 mph wind three days later. `` <PERSON> Emily </PERSON> was the fastest moving hurricane of any known in this century,'' Case said. Hurricane <PERSON> Arlene </PERSON> meandered through the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> in mid-August with top wind of 75 mph. Hurricane Floyd hit Key West with 75 mph wind but fizzled out over the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> in mid-October. Here are the names to be given to <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> tropical storms that could grow into hurricanes this season: <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON>, <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON>, <PERSON> Chris </PERSON>, <PERSON> Debby </PERSON>, Ernesto, <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, <PERSON> Helene </PERSON>, <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON>, <PERSON> Joan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Keith </PERSON>, <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nadine </PERSON>, <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON>, <PERSON> Patty </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tony </PERSON>, <PERSON> Valerie </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Independent Counsel Argues Against Separate Trials</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The prosecution in the Iran-Contra case insists a joint trial can be held, despite the judge's reservation that it could damage the defendants' rights to confront each other at trial. Separate trials for <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> and three co-defendants would be `` a massive waste of time and effort,'' Independent Counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said Tuesday in a legal brief. Last week, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said a single trial on the crucial conspiracy charge may be a `` practical impossibility,'' but he did not rule on the issue. The prosecutor said that the defense strategy would require five separate trials on various counts for <PERSON> North </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staffer; and one each for <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s former national security adviser; businessman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>; and his former partner, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said the defendants participated in a `` common scheme'' to `` create, protect, and preserve an illegal financial and logistical network ... to support the -LRB- Nicaraguan -RRB- Contras and other activities'' designed by North and <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>. North's lawyers contended that multiple trials were needed for their client on counts that charged him but not other defendants. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said the law did not require such a separation. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said last week a single trial would have problems because co-defendants might be unable to exercise their rights to fully confront each other in cross-examination. In this case, such cross-examination might involve questions that refer to testimony given to the congressional Iran-Contra investigating committees under a grant of limited immunity from prosecution. The immunized testimony _ given by all defendants except <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> _ can not be used by the prosecution, and there's a chance that <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> may bar the defense from using it also. That would create a conflict between the Fifth Amendment privilege of a testifying defendant not to have his immunized testimony used against him and the right of a defendant under the Sixth Amendment to confront his co-defendants in a trial. In the Iran-Contra case, <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> has asked for the right to question North about his immunized testimony on grounds that <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s statements to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would prove <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>'s innocence. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> replied there would be no need for a reference to the congressional testimony, because the defendants _ testifying under oath in both cases _ would provide the same information. `` Moreover, even if a defendant initially were to make statements at trial inconsistent with his prior testimony, his memory could be refreshed without the need for the introduction of that testimony,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said. `` Material used to refresh a witness' recollection need not be admissible itself,'' he said. If a conflict developed between the congressional and trial testimony, the court `` has the ability ... to decide whether to permit a line of questioning drawing on immunized testimony,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said. The court also has the option of severing certain charges from the case to keep immunized testimony out, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said at a hearing May 26, `` As I see it, it is a practical impossibility to try the conspiracy counts in the context'' of rules on immunity. `` If you try them -LRB- the defendants -RRB- together, you violate the immunities.'' But the judge added that trying the defendants separately `` makes a conspiracy trial a farce. None gets the benefit of the other's testimony.'' He commented at one point, `` Four individual trials is ridiculous.''

<HEAD>Appeals Court Upholds Congressional Pay Raises</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court ruling allows members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to keep the $ 12,100 pay raise they received last year and continue using the law that gave them the increase. In a 3-0 ruling Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> agreed with a lower court ruling last year that the Federal Salary Act is constitutional. Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> earn $ 89,500, although leaders in each house earn slightly more. Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, and five House Republicans challenged the act's multistep procedure: establishment of a pay study commission; the commission's recommendation to the president; a presidential decision setting the increase; and the chance for lawmakers to change the presidential ruling. The lawmakers said the Constitution's intent was that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> set its pay scale by passing a law, a politically risky system used from the founding of the nation through enactment of the current law in 1967. The challenge also contended the act violated the constitutional separation of powers among the branches by delegating decision-making authority to the president in setting the pay. The salary act determines pay increases not only for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, but also for judges and high-ranking executive branch officials. Since the court threw out the challenge, it di not address whether a decision declaring the law unconstitutional would have wiped out salary increases for judges and administration officials. The appellate court said the 1967 law is constitutional because it gives <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> the ultimate role of disapproving salary recommendations by the president. The pay commission is established every four years, its members appointed by all three branches. After the commission reports to the president and the chief executive submits his figures to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, lawmakers have 30 days to disapprove the presidential decision. Otherwise, the president's figures take effect. Referring to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' ability to change the president's recommendations, the court said, `` Whatever the practical difficulties and political realities, Senator <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> and his co-plaintiffs have readily at hand ... an ` in-house' remedy ... The availability of an internally available remedy to members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> means that it would be an abuse of discretion for the judiciary to entertain the action.'' In 1987, the commission recommended giving <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> a raise to $ 135,000. But President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, citing the need to reduce the deficit, recommended the $ 12,100 figure. The opinion was written by <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Circuit Judge <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Starr </PERSON>. Joining him were Circuit Judges <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Wald </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>. Challenging the law along with <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> were <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dornan </PERSON>, R-Calif.; <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Beau </PERSON> <PERSON> Boulter </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, R-Ill.; and <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Holloway </PERSON>,

 Millions of abortions performed worldwide each year pose the largest threat to global peace, <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> said Tuesday after receiving an honorary doctorate for her service to the poor. `` Abortion has become the greatest destroyer of peace because it destroys two lives, the life of that child and the conscience of the mother,'' she said at a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> convocation. `` It is a terrible thing for that little unborn child, which was created to love and be loved, to be destroyed by its own mother.'' <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON>, who in 1948 formed the <ORGANIZATION> Missionaries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Charity </ORGANIZATION>, an order with nearly 3,000 members worldwide, also asked the audience of 6,000 people to `` share the joy of loving with each other'' by giving possessions to the needy. `` By just giving of your abundance you do n't feel the joy of sharing, so give until it hurts,'' the 78-year-old Roman Catholic nun said. `` This is the joy of loving.'' The 1979 Nobel Peace Prize winner, who has served the impoverished people of 71 countries since resigning as principal of a <LOCATION> Calcutta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, convent high school in 1931, received an honorary doctorate of humane letters.

 Rep. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> English </PERSON> says he's launching a series of hearings this week into the federal offensive in the war on drugs to glean information that will serve as the cornerstone of a 1988 drug bill. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is going to pass an omnibus drug bill in the next few months, and it is essential to develop a record of exactly what happened to the 1986 act,'' the <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> Democrat said Tuesday. `` We have to know where we are if we want to know where we're going.

<TEXT>
 Two former Latin American presidents say they met with <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s military leader, Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, and offered to mediate this nation's political crisis. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Oduber </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> said they made the offer as part of a Latin American initiative during a two-hour meeting Tuesday with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> shortly after arriving in the country. State-run Channel 2 television later broadcast their statements. There was no immediate response from <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on the initiative, and his press office would not say whether <PERSON> Oduber </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> were still in the country. `` We came to offer our good offices to try to find a solution to the problem. We are doing this as Latin Americans because we are worried,'' <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said. He said he and <PERSON> Oduber </PERSON> told <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> they planned to divide their mission into two parties _ to achieve a dialogue between the government and the opposition, and to resolve the confrontation between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the Noriega-controlled government. Both the opposition and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> want <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to relinquish power. The general, who heads the country's 15,000-strong <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, was indicted in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on federal drug trafficking charges in February <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s acting president, <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON>, was also present at Tuesday's meeting at a louge in <LOCATION> Tocumen </LOCATION> air force base near the capital, which occurred after <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Oduber </PERSON> arrived in a private plane. The two were picked for the mission by President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, who announced the initiative on Monday. An earlier effort to have <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s Roman Catholic archbishop, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON>, mediate the crisis failed because of what <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> called interference by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Most Latin American leaders have been cool to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who has been accused of electoral fraud, graft and political assassination, but also resent overt intervention by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to force the general's ouster. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> has been hurt by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions imposed after the drug indictments to try and force <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to leave <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has not budged, and negotiations with a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> envoy about the general's stepping down broke down last week.

The two are crisscrossing the state in anticipation of Tuesday's primary election <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON> faces no GOP challenger. <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON> faces nominal opposition from two little-known Democrats: <PERSON> Elnardo </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>, a 40-year-old state <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> recreation official who contends the senator is out of touch with constituents, and <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. Young, who is running as a `` conservative-radical.'' Nationally, the Republicans have targeted <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON> as one of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s most vulnerable incumbents. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> spoke at a Dawkins fund-raiser in March that took in $ 300,000. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s popular <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> governor, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON>, is chairing <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON>' campaign <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>'s bid is led by the equally popular Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, the state's Democratic senior senator. <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON> has raised nearly $ 4 million and has tried to get the best campaign help money can buy. In a way, <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> is part of <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>'s problem. Since taking office in 1982, <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON> has worked to emerge from the shadow of his nationally known colleague, a former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basketball </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> star and like <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON> a Rhodes scholar. Part of <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON>' strategy has been to subtly stress his similarities to <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>. The message has been clear: by electing <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> _ the brunt of garbage-dump and gangster jokes _ could be the only state to boast two <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> scholars as senators. <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON> has begun to sell himself as a natural senator. He was captain of his West Point football team, decorated as a paratrooper in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and named the youngest general in Army history. Along the way, he studied at <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> and earned a Ph.D. from <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON> left the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in 1983 to join the Shearson-Lehman brokerage house in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. He resigned last year to become a full-time candidate, and moved from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to the exclusive <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Rumson </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON> has a larger-than-than life presence, augmented by piercing eyes, a Steve Canyon jaw and a broadcaster's voice. `` When he walks in a room, heads turn. People know he's there,'' said Campaign Manager <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodyear </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>'s camp says its candidate also has a remarkable background, and two things <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON> does n't have: a proven legislative record and a long-term connection with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. `` The <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON> story is very compelling,'' asserted <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Begala </PERSON>, spokesman for the senator's campaign. As he did in his 1982 upset of Republican Sen. <PERSON> Millicent </PERSON> <PERSON> Fenwick </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON> _ affable, white-haired and with a noticable gap in his front teeth _ is stressing his roots as the son of poor immigrants, raised in the textile center of <LOCATION> Paterson </LOCATION>. He attended <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> on the GI <PERSON> Bill </PERSON>, and helped to found the worldwide <ORGANIZATION> Automatic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Processing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. En route, he amassed a personal fortune topping $ 25 million, and became an international philanthropist <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON> is running on his record, greatly enhanced when <PERSON> Democrats </PERSON> took control of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> last year. Then an obscure freshman, <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON> was elevated to chair subcommittees on transportation and the environment, two meat-and-potatoes issues in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> politics. For <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON>, the goal is to convince voters that his remarkable resume qualifies him to be a better senator. According to <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON> will assert that <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON> has `` a record of no achievement, no accomplishment ... lackluster performance.'' <PERSON> Begala </PERSON> countered, `` <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>'s motto is ` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> first.' The other guy's is, ` Me first.'''

 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s average household income has topped $ 40,000 a year, but nearly half of all households report difficulties in making ends meet, according to a survey released today. The nationwide survey conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> showed the average income of Japanese households was $ 40,400 in 1986. The figure was 2.5 percent higher than the previous year, but was the lowest increase since the first such survey was conducted in 1962. The survey, conducted last summer, says there are 38.06 million households in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, with an average 3.19 persons per household. Of the total households, 3.47 million were composed of people 65 years or older, up 4.5 percent from the year before.

In the survey, 45,000 households, chosen at random, were asked about the ages of their family members, and 8,000 about income. Asked about living standards, 52.4 percent said they were living an `` average'' life, up from 49.7 percent the previous year. Forty percent, unchanged from last year's survey, reported they found it hard to make ends meet.

<HEAD>Doctors Looking To Help Young Kidney Recipients Grow Normally</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCIA DUNN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Now that the finer points of kidney transplantation have been mastered, doctors are looking for ways to make young recipients grow up to be big as well as strong, virtually impossible under conventional therapy. `` You can give them a good kidney, but if we do n't give them a good life, it is n't worth it,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Amir </PERSON> <PERSON> Tejani </PERSON>, director of renal services at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Children with kidney failure, like those with other major illnesses, tend to be shorter than normal, sometimes barely topping 4 feet as adults. Even with successful transplants, they do n't come close to reaching normal size because of a steroid commonly given them along with anti-rejection drugs. `` They want to look normal. They want to feel normal,'' <PERSON> Tejani </PERSON> said Tuesday at the annual conference of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transplant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physicians </ORGANIZATION>. `` You ca n't tell them the world is made up of small people when Americans are getting taller,'' added Dr. <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Greifer </PERSON>, medical director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kidney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. To help the youngsters grow, <PERSON> Tejani </PERSON> is trying to withhold the steroid, prednisone, from their post-transplant treatment. The drug usually is combined with the potent anti-rejection drug cyclosporine and inhibits the growth plate in the bone from functioning normally. It also causes acne and puffiness, most noticeably in the face. Some children, especially girls, cheat on their medication in a desperate attempt to improve their looks, <PERSON> Tejani </PERSON> said. `` The main bugaboo of children is that they look ugly and do n't grow,'' he Perhaps the best known case is that of <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, star of the former television series `` Diff ` rent The 19-year-old actor, who has undergone two kidney transplants, is less than 5 feet tall. `` It's the ones who are 5 feet that want to be 5 feet 2,'' <PERSON> Greifer </PERSON> said. `` They would give anything for another 2 inches.'' About 1,200 youngsters age 16 and under experience kidney failure every year in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Greifer </PERSON>. Six hundred to 800 end up receiving new kidneys, fewer than 9 percent of the total number of kidney transplants performed annually. Overall, transplanted kidneys were still functioning at a rate of up 80 to 85 percent a year after the operation, according to Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transplant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Surgeons </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Tejani </PERSON> said that he's tried since 1983 to remove prednisone from the treatment of 30 children whose transplanted kidneys have functioned well. Twenty-three of the youngsters were able to be treated solely with cyclosporine for a time, <PERSON> Tejani </PERSON> said. But nine of these had to return to prednisone after experiencing episodes of organ rejection. The remaining 14 patients have been off prednisone for up to 4 -LCB- years without any episodes of organ rejection or side effects, according to <PERSON> Tejani </PERSON>. More importantly, all of them have grown, including one 17-year-old boy who has reached 5 feet 8. `` Even for a third of them to grow normally, then by all means we should be doing this for our kids or at least trying,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunsicker </PERSON>, president of the transplant society. Children who undergo liver and heart transplants also experience severe growth problems, but it's too risky to toy with their anti-rejection therapy, according to doctors. `` With kidneys, if you goof you lose the kidney'' and patients can return to dialysis, <PERSON> Tejani </PERSON> said. `` With livers and hearts, there's no other option.'' In patients unable to be weaned off prednisone, <PERSON> Tejani </PERSON> has administered growth hormone, enabling them to catch up on some lost growth. He's also tried replacing prednisone with immuran, an anti-metabolic drug, but it's too early to know the results. Doctors at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> are trying other methods to enhance kidney patients' growth. For about the past year, Dr. <PERSON> Vera </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, a clinical fellow at <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION>, and other researchers have administered growth hormone to young patients on dialysis and those who have undergone kidney transplants. Up to 100 percent increases in growth have been noted. `` The data seem good. There seems to be hope,'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said. `` But we need to have longer trials.''

<HEAD>Reagan Encourages Soviet Reform; Gorbachev Gives President Tour</HEAD>

 Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> commenced their final full-blown summit session Wednesday morning as top-ranking officials awaited a ceremonial exchange of the final instruments of ratification for the medium-range missile treaty. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> won a fresh endorsement Tuesday from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for his Soviet reform program, but the leaders only inched forward during ticklish arms negotiations and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> suggested it may be `` time to bang our fists on the table'' to end the impasse. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said the leaders were likely to sign a joint statement, either on Wednesday or just before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s departure Thursday, spelling out progress on two of the main obstacles to a strategic missile reduction treaty in an upbeat overview of the U.S.-Soviet relationship. Both leaders touched on the arms issue in toasts at a dinner <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> hosted for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at the home of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador Tuesday night. The president said the superpowers should work together `` that we might forever keep our swords at our sides.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> responded by acknowledging the superpowers' rivalry `` above all in the military sphere.'' But, he said, `` I see a future in which the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> base their relations on disarmament, a balance of interest and comprehensive cooperation, rather than on deterring each other or upgrading their military capabilities.'' The movement on the strategic arms front came on a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal to verify limits on mobile missiles and on counting nuclear-tipped cruise missiles aboard warplanes, said the official, who spoke on condition he not be further identified. There was no progress on the thorniest obstacle of all, and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said his Star Wars program was not even discussed. `` We would like the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> delegation to originate fresh ideas,'' Soviet spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said later. Nor did <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> attempt to tackle any of the thorny regional issues that bear on their relationship around the globe. They sidetracked policy differences in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> to focus on <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s perestroika campaign to restructure the Soviet economy. `` We still have a day and a half to go so I will reserve final judgment,'' said a senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity at a midnight briefing after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> hosted <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at dinner. Following the day's only summit session, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> steered <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> through Red Square, a stroll which delighted and surprised visitors, especially when <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> picked up and cuddled a toddler. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he found Red Square, site of this communist state's annual military reviews, `` wonderful.'' During an encounter with reporters, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was asked if he still believed the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was an `` evil empire,'' as he described it in March 1983. Standing next to his host, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` I was talking about another time, another era,'' the president said. Several reporters permitted access to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for a few minutes described him as looking tired and possibly limping. Spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` There is no problem with the president's health,'' but that `` he did have a difficult night's sleep `` We are all a little tired, and that's reflected in all our delegation,'' he said. But Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, during her trip to <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>, was asked about the president and said, `` He sleeps fine.'' The 77-year-old president arrived here Sunday after a four-day rest stop in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, en route from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. On their third day of talks, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> met in the Soviet leader's <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> office, sitting beneath a portrait of <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> and holding what presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> called a largely `` philosophiocal'' discussion on perestroika _ <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s economic reform effort _ that ran more than an hour. In giving his blessing to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s economic reform efforts, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said taht in his talks with the Soviet leader, `` I have spoken of how important it is to institutionalize change _ to put guarantees on reform.'' He told <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students they are living `` in one of the most exciting, hopeful times in Soviet history. It is a time when the first breath of freedom stirs the air and the heart beats to the accelerated rhythm of hope, when the accumulated spiritual energies of a long silence yearn to break free.'' `` We do not know what will be the conclusion of this journey,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` but we are hopeful that the promise of reform will be fulfilled. The leaders also watched and joined in the applause as Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> signed several secondary agreements, including a pair of arms accords. Under one pact, the superpowers will notify each other at least 24 hours in advance of the time, place and intended target of intercontinental-range missiles tests. The other sets up joint experiments this summer in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Semipalatinsk </LOCATION> of devices to measure underground nuclear test explosions. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, continuing his campaign to promote freedom and human rights in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, met over lunch at the House of Writers with artists, filmmakers and writers. He told them `` I ` ve found that Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has the ability to grasp and hold a vision and I respect him for that.'' But the fellowship did not lead to any breakthrough in the effort to agree on terms for a 30 to 50 percent reduction in long-range bombers, land-based missiles and nuclear submarines. Squabbling over <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION> and sorting out pesky verification problems stand in the way. `` I'm sure that if the president makes good use of his time that we have remaining, I'm sure that we will be able to prepare the treaty,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. Both sides expressed a commitment to seeking agreement before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> leaves office. At the opening of their first session on Sunday, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said `` it ` s quite possible'' there would be another summit if the treaty were ready before January 20. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> recalled that in 1985, at their first summit in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, the two leaders had reached an impasse at one point. He said the president told him ` Well, let's stamp our fists on the table,' and I said all right.'' `` Maybe now it is again a time to bang our fists on the table once again,'' the Soviet leader said. Asked by a reporter if he agreed, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` I'll do anything that works.'' During a question-and-answer session with students at <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` We are hopeful that it can be finished before I leave office. But I assure you, if it is n't ... I will have impressed upon my successor that we must carry on until it is signed.'' In the speech, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> stressed the value of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> freedoms, including the free market economy, and said, `` it's so hard for government planners, no matter how sophisticated, to ever substitute for millions of individuals working night and day to make their dreams come true. The fact is, bureaucracies are a problem around the world.'' Then, in response to a question, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> `` has been most helpful, he has been most agreeable,'' in dealing with the cases raised by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` I am not blaming you, I blame bureaucracy,'' he said in regard to the complaints of restrictions on emigration and other freedoms. Asked about the remarks, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said `` I think the president is fully aware of the constraints on emigration here, and the source of that is within the Soviet system.''

 Striking workers today freed a top <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> official they had held hostage for five days, but continued to hold 10 other executives. Management locked out 20,000 workers at another <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> plant. Chairman <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> <PERSON> Mong-ku </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Precision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> was released from a plant in the southern city of <LOCATION> Changwon </LOCATION> in a deal under which talks on workers' demands for higher wages are to resume Thursday. He was taken to a hospital by ambulance and was being treated for high blood pressure and exhaustion, authorities said. But company President <PERSON> Yoo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ki-chul </PERSON> and nine other officials seized Friday were still being held by strikers, officials said. Workers guarded the gates of the plant that manufactures rolling stock and unspecified defense equipment. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, another division of the giant conglomerate, announced a lockout at its plant in the east coast city of <LOCATION> Ulsan </LOCATION> as 20,000 workers refused to return to work. Strikers then left the plant and said they would spend the rest of the week helping farmers with the spring rice planting. <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s biggest auto maker, produces about 2,700 vehicles a day.

<HEAD>Researchers: AIDS Virus May Enter Dormant Stage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENISE LAYFIELD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Researchers have discovered that the AIDS virus apparently may become dormant in the human body and undetectable by the standard test, but say the finding does not mean the nation's blood supply is endangered `` The blood supply is exceptionally safe and protected to a great extent by existing screning tests and the self-deferral of individuals at high risk,'' said <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Polk </PERSON>, a professor of epidemiology at the <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> and co-author of the study published today in June's Annals of Internal Medicine. Tests to pinpoint the disease and protect blood supplies are based on detection of HIV-1 antibodies, produced naturally by the body to fight the acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus. The instances of AIDS victims who stop producing detectable antibodies to the disease appear to be rare and so far have only been observed in those who have shown small amounts of the virus in their bodies, said <PERSON> Homayoon </PERSON> <PERSON> Farzadegan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Saah </PERSON>, also professors of epidemiology at <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> and authors of the study. <PERSON> Farzadegan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Saah </PERSON> said at a news conference Tuesday that four homosexual men infected with AIDS stopped producing detectable antibodies, though a newer test showed they still are infected with the virus. <PERSON> Farzadegan </PERSON> said the phenomenon may mean that the virus has the potential of going into a latent phase, during which it does not reproduce. The four were among 1,000 homosexual men infected with the virus who participated in the continuing study. The four showed the loss of antibodies up to 3 -LCB- years ago, though one has since shown signs of the AIDS infection and has developed antibodies again. `` Usually when an infected person loses HIV-1 antibodies, he or she is in the end stages of AIDS and has a deteriorated immune system,'' said Polk. The four `` had no clinical symptoms of illness, such as swollen lymph glands or abnormal counts of the white blood cells targeted by the virus.'' The researchers reported their findings last June, but could not determine whether the men had been properly diagnosed as having AIDS or whether mistakes had been made in laboratory tests. During the follow-up study, the researchers used a new method to test for the virus instead of the antibody test and determined that the men showed evidence of infection, but not HIV-1 antibodies. The new test, called PCR or polymerase chain reaction assay, magnifies the presence of the virus' genetic material inside cells up to 1 million times. `` We do n't know if something in the virus itself is defective and causing it not to reproduce, or whether it is something within the host,'' Saah said, adding that researchers have not determined whether the disease is transmittable during this phase. <PERSON> Farzadegan </PERSON> said the new test was not commonly used to screen blood donors because of the complexity of conducting it and interpreting its results. In an editorial accompanying the article, Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuck </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> said that even though the four would not have been picked out by the AIDS test used by blood centers, the finding does not mean that the blood supply is threatened. He wrote that there was no evidence that unexpectedly large numbers of AIDS virus infections had been spread by transfusions since 1985, when screening began, and that efforts to discourage blood donations from those at high risk for AIDS were largely successful. AIDS attacks the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancers. It is most often transmitted by exposure to the body fluids of a person who carries the disease, including sexual contact, blood transfusions or the sharing of contaminated hypodermic needles. All of the men who participated in the initial report are participants in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, which follows nearly 5,000 homosexual and bisexual men in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> to document the natural progression of AIDS.

 A genetically engineered protein that kills transplant-attacking cells in mice should be tested soon on humans, and researchers hope it will reduce or eliminate the need for anti-rejection drugs. `` It's the promise for the future that's very exciting,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, chief of biomolecular medicine at <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. Researchers expect the protein to be introduced for some leukemia patients this fall and for transplant patients in about a year. The leukemia patients suffer from a form of the disease marked by an excess of the transplant-attacking blood cells. `` There's no question that if everything works out the way we'd like it to, it will be a whole new way'' of treating transplant patients and victims of certain immune diseases, said Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkman </PERSON>, a transplant surgeon at <LOCATION> Brigham </LOCATION> and Women's Hospital in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <PERSON> Kirkman </PERSON> said Tuesday at the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transplant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physicians </ORGANIZATION> that the new fusion protein has succeeded in prolonging the lives of mice after heart transplantation. Nine of the 10 mice in the experiment appeared to retain their new hearts permanently without need for continual therapy. Dr. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunsicker </PERSON>, the society's president, hailed the fusion protein as `` terribly important.'' `` The hope is that you could get someone who needs a kidney transplant and put in whatever one you have available,'' <PERSON> Hunsicker </PERSON> said. `` Maybe -LRB- tissue -RRB- matching at that point would n't make a difference.'' Researchers have been working for nearly a decade on the new protein, a fusion of a portion of the diphtheria toxin, one of the deadliest known toxins, and the natural immune system protein interleukin-2. When the body's immune system is confronted with unfamiliar material such as bacteria or a transplanted organ, it fights back with a group of cells called T-cells. The foreign substances activate a small number of T-cells, which produce interleukin-2 receptors, points on the cell surface to which only interleukin-2 molecules will stick. Activation of these receptors leads to an immunological cascade that stimulates more harmful cells that then attack the transplanted organ, leading to rejection of the foreign tissue. To prevent this from happening, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> and Dr. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Strom </PERSON>, director of clinical immunology at <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Beth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, isolated the part of the diphtheria toxin that binds it to other cells and replaced it with the binding portion of the interleukin-2 molecule. The result was a hybrid protein that seeks out and attaches to only those T-cells harmful to transplanted organs, and kills the T-cells with the toxin. `` This therapy only zaps the cells that are active -LRB- against the transplanted organ -RRB- at that time and does n't depress the -LRB- disease-fighting -RRB- immune system across the board,'' <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> said. Cyclosporine, a popular anti-rejection drug, suppresses the body's entire immune system and, therefore, enhances the risk of infection. Side effects include kidney failure, excessive hair growth and tremors. Cyclosporine also costs transplant patients $ 5,000 a year or more. And doctors at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> are reporting an increase in malignant tumors in transplant patients receiving cyclosporine along with steroids and another drug, azathioprine. The so-called triple drug therapy is suspected of being responsible for the cancer, although there is no hard evidence so far. It is likely the fusion protein would be used with cyclosporine in humans, pending <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> approval, <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> said. `` So maybe a little bit of cyclosporine will go a long way with this toxin,'' he said. Researchers said the fusion protein eventually may be used to treat autoimmune diseases, in which the body produces a disordered immunological response against itself. Such diseases include forms of diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis. Also at Tuesday's meeting, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>, chief of infectious disease for transplantation at <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, warned doctors they may be doing more harm than good by putting new kidneys into dialysis patients infected with AIDS. About 250 people currently are on dialysis who test positive for the AIDS virus but exhibit no symptoms of the disease, <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said. `` Nobody wants to turn their backs on these people,'' he said. But preliminary data suggest `` these folks do not do as well as other folks following transplantation.''

<HEAD>Beach Ban Not Enforced As Summer Season Starts</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WELLS, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The beach season's start brought an onslaught of sunbathers to one of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>'s few sandy beaches but none of the turmoil expected from a ruling that limited access to the seashore in accordance with 17th century Puritan law. But an attorney for homeowners along the cherished beach in southern <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> warned Tuesday that vacationers who relax on the wrong patch of sand could wind up in court. At issue is mile-long <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION>, which a <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge ruled in September is in effect private. The judge agreed with 30 homeowners that the beach between the high and low tide marks is limited to fishing, bird hunting and boating based on a 1648 ordinance. The homeowners argued that sunbathers occupy the beach in front of their homes _ property which they say is deeded to them _ and make noise and leave behind trash. Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brodrick </PERSON>'s decision has been appealed to the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which is expected to rule in September. The high court's decision also could affect some of the remaining 35 miles of sandy beaches along <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>'s 3,500 miles of coastline. Meantime, <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> police Chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Zackular </PERSON> says he will make no trespassing arrests at the beach this summer. He said he was instructed by the offices of the <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> district attorney and state attorney general to withhold enforcing the court decision until the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rules. But <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thaxter </PERSON>, an attorney for the homeowners, believes the town must enforce the decision pending the outcome of the appeal. `` It's always been a private beach,'' <PERSON> Thaxter </PERSON> said. `` The judge says it's a private beach and ... the public is n't allowed to be there.'' <PERSON> Thaxter </PERSON> said the chief's actions violate the order, and he suggested that the town is `` encouraging the use of the property.'' He added that the police should at least come up with a solution more equitable to the homeowners if the ruling is not going to be enforced. If that fails, <PERSON> Thaxter </PERSON> said he would consider suing beachgoers for civil trespass. `` The homeowners want to live in peace with the town and the people that live there, but they're tired of being abused,'' he said. <PERSON> Zackular </PERSON> countered that he has increased patrols at the beach and is considering adding lifeguards to keep an eye on sunbathers. `` Near as I can tell the vast majority of the <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> people are happy with it,'' the chief said. `` They're happy with the increased enforcement. ... There are just a few people who have n't been pleased. The police department received no complaints of trespassing during the Memorial Day weekend, <PERSON> Zackular </PERSON> said. But some homeowners found weekend beachgoers annoying. `` I feel so sorry for my grandchildren because during the summer there's absolutely no place to play,'' said <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, 68, a plaintiff in the lawsuit. `` And it is n't even safe to run down there and play _ with all those strangers _ in this day and age.''

 Soviet emgire <PERSON> Natan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> called the summit between President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> `` a show,'' and said the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> policy of glasnost is simply a `` new set of instructions.''

<TEXT>
 A group of South African clergymen has pledged to organize anti-government protests and called for increased non-violent resistance to apartheid in apparent violation of government restrictions. The decision was made at an emergency conference _ the largest and most broadly based of its type _ that ended Tuesday with a church service at the <ORGANIZATION> Regina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mundi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>'s largest black township. `` We are determined we are going to obey God whatever the cost,'' Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> told a mostly-black crowd of 1,200 during the service. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> then ripped symbolic gags from the mouths of black and white youths on the podium, took up a wooden cross and carried it back and forth down the cathedral's center aisle. The audience sang an African hymn, then held hands and swayed together, singing the American civil rights song, `` We Shall Overcome.'' Security force vehicles, including a tear-gas truck, lined the street outside. More than 200 religious leaders representing more than 30 church groups assembled Monday in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> to consider new tactics to oppose the white minority government's racial policies. They ended the two-day convocation with a decision to mobilize support for a three-day national protest planned next week by black trade unions. They also said that, on June 12, they would start a campaign for the release of political prisoners. The campaign is to end July 18th _ the 70th birthday of jailed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>. The Rev. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON>, general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, said the clergymen's plans might be regarded by some as civil disobedience. `` We are not trying to undermine authority or advocate anarchy,'' he said. `` We are distinguishing between two different kinds of authority'' _ that between God and man. The government has recently banned numerous groups such as unions and newspapers from conducting political activity. Anti-apartheid factions in the church, which was not initially included in the ban, have begun to take up the struggle where these groups left off. The Rev. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON>, mixed-race leader of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reformed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, said he had hoped the statement adopted by the convocation would have been stronger, calling for more protests and direct confrontation with the government. `` It will take time. But we are moving away from a theology of protest to a life of protest and resistance,'' <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON> said. On the church podium were about 45 of the clergymen who attended the convocation, including <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> and <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON>. `` What this convocation wants to say is that the church of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> has no choice but to stand up for the poor and weak and oppressed in this country,'' said <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON>. `` We say to the South African government ... we must be more obedient to God than to you.'' During the convocation, workshops were held to discuss a range of anti-apartheid tactics, including `` non-cooperation and non-collaboration'' with the government. The agenda suggested that targets of civil disobedience could include tax payments, military service and racially oriented laws such as those mandating segregated residential areas. The convocation was sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, which includes major Protestant denominations active in the fight for black rights. Also participating were the Roman Catholic Church and a number of independent African churches. Organizers said political conditions in the country have worsened since leading clergymen decided in early February to organize the convocation. They cited the effective bannings of 17 anti-apartheid organizations, the closure of two opposition newspapers and pending legislation to restrict labor unions and opposition political groups.

 A weekend tremor labeled as an earthquake was a strip-mine blast, a geologist says. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Survey </ORGANIZATION> said the blast at 12:18 p.m. Saturday was labeled an earthquake by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Earthquake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and state officials based on information on seismographs. `` It was picked up on a number of seismographs ... as far west as <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said Tuesday. The blast registered 3.5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale of ground movement and was centered near the southeastern <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> community of <LOCATION> Gaysport </LOCATION>. `` Usually, we can tell the difference between a quarry blast and an earthquake on the seismograph,'' <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said. But he said in this case the seismographic waves appeared to be those of an earthquake. Because <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> remained suspicious, he checked with mining companies Tuesday and learned one had set off a blast precisely at the time the ground waves were recorded. `` We were not able to find very many people who felt the earthquake,'' <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said. `` That was kind of strange, too.'' <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said earthquakes have been reported in that portion of the state most recently in 1953.

<HEAD>Dollar Gains, Stocks Surge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar gained ground against the Japanese yen in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> today, while stock prices surged following an overnight advance on Wall Street. After opening higher at 125.23 yen, the dollar climbed further, closing at 125.35 yen, up a strong 0.55 yen from Tuesday's finish. `` The dollar held steady between 125.10 and 125.37 yen throughout the day in mixed trading,'' said a foreign exchange dealer with a major <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> commercial bank, speaking on condition of anonymity. There were active selling orders from export-related industries but the dollar was supported by buying by financial organizations, he said. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues, which gained 193.60 points Tuesday, added another 287.21 points, or 1.04 percent, closing the day's trading at 27,703.91. Share prices rose almost across the board, encouraged by Tuesday's rise on <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, where the Dow Jones industrial average gained 74.68 points and rose about the 2,000-point level, traders said. Wall Street's rally prompted <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> investors to erase their worries about the possibility of a hike in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> discount rate, an analyst said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Volume on the first section was estimated at a heavy 2.5 billion shares, up from 1.7 billion shares on Tuesday. It was the heaviest volume this year, and near the market's record of 2.83 billion shares set in March last year. Prominent among winners were steels, constructions and chemicals. Drugs, electricals and automobiles also gained ground.

<HEAD>Fomer Welfare Mother Becomes Surgeon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A woman who beat poverty and welfare to become a surgeon says anyone can do the same, if they are determined. The reception Dr. <PERSON> Charon </PERSON> <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON> got when she landed at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> International Airport recently was considerably different than when she first arrived in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> 11 years ago. At that time she was a welfare mother, a high school dropout from <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, cradling her 3-month-old crying baby in her arms. She had $ 30, a gift from a shelter for battered women. Late last month, she returned to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> as a newly certified general surgeon. <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON>, a proud new graduate of the prestigious <ORGANIZATION> Mayo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, was greeted by her son <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON>, now a cheerful-looking 11-year-old. <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON>'s mother was at her south-central <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> home planning a surprise party for her daughter. `` If I could get up on top of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Everest </LOCATION> and tell about this kid, I'd do it,'' <PERSON> Alberta </PERSON> <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON> said of her daughter. `` She is just an inspiration.'' More than 100 people showed up at a restaurant in suburban <PERSON> Hawthorne </PERSON> recently to celebrate <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON>'s success. <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON>, 28, was greeted by former neighbors and former co-workers from the public clinic where she got her first taste of medical life as a clerk. Also present was the administrator at that clinic who told <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON> that she should become a nurse. Today, he marvels at her accomplishment. `` Honestly, I did n't think she could go through medical school _ with all the discipline that required _ and still raise her child,'' said <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON>, administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Claude </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hudson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Comprehensive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON> did n't take <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON>' advice. She skipped high school and passed a test giving her a Graduate Equivalency Diploma. Then, she enrolled at <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles-Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. A year later, she transferred to <ORGANIZATION> Loyola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marymount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, where she took premedical courses and graduated cum laude in 1984. Her residency in general surgery begins in a few weeks at the naval hospital in <LOCATION> Portsmouth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` I think anybody can do it if they try,'' she said. `` People tend to settle for so little when they do n't have to. ... I'm sorry that most women do n't think it's an option for them.'' Racial discrimination was an added burden during her studies, said <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON>, who is black. `` One time -LRB- a dean -RRB- told me that the reason they let me into medical school was so future generations of minorities, like my son, would have a place in the world; but I was n't really qualified to be there,'' <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON> says. That hurt, but it increased her determination to become a doctor. `` As far as I can remember, that's what I wanted to be,'' <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON> said. `` I think it was a response to people telling me I was n't going to be anything. `` They say, ` You ca n't.' Therefore you say, ` I can.' ... Actually, I do n't think it's that amazing. Anyone can do it.''

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Mengistu </PERSON> <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariam </PERSON> denies his government is using food as a weapon in northern provinces where secessionist insurgencies and crop failures threaten the lives of 3.2 million people. For the first time, the <LOCATION> Ethiopian </LOCATION> leader also accused Arab countries of backing the rebel movement. He claimed the Moslem nations want to consolidate their control of the Red Sea. During Tuesday's six-hour news conference, <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION>'s first with foreign reporters in two years, he also called for better relations with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The moustachioed Marxist leader spoke with unprecedented candor on numerous other issues, gesticulating with passion, occasionally smiling and laughing. <PERSON> Mengistu </PERSON> denied his government is using food as a weapon in the north, where the war and a government counteroffensive have jeopardized a massive Western-financed relief effort for millions of people facing starvation in <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> and Tigre provinces. `` How is it possible, how is it imaginable that a government which came to power by the will of the people ... can be accused of using food as a weapon,'' <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION> said. `` We revolutionaries do not live for ourselves, we live for others.'' In early April, the government ordered all foreign relief workers out of <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> and Tigre for security reasons. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> at first said it was defying the order to recall its 25 or so workers, citing a `` humanitarian responsibility for the fate of some 5 million people'' in the two drought-stricken provinces. When the government insisted that the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> workers leave the areas, the agency locked up its supplies and trucks and left. On May 22, <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> gave the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> 15 days to hand over the food. <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> officials denied earlier requests because they said they must be present to supervise the food's distribution. In the past, there have been allegations that food destined for starving farmers has fed Ethiopian troops. <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION> said the rebels are using the food issue `` to elicit international sympathy and support for them to promote their propaganda activities against us.'' On Sunday, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION> had promised when the two met two days earlier to allow the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to expand its role in the north to ensure the continued flow of aid. The chief <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> representative in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Priestley </PERSON>, said <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION> had promised `` in principle'' to allow more <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> personnel into the north and to permit them to move outside government-held towns. Rebels of the <ORGANIZATION> Eritrean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> have been fighting for 27 years in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s oldest civil war and have won major victories this year with the capture of several towns. <PERSON> Mengistu </PERSON>, who is in his mid-40s, made no reference to a younger insurgency by rebels of the <ORGANIZATION> Tigrean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, who have been fighting for 14 years. During the conference, <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION> said unspecified Arab nations were backing the Eritrean group. Rebels `` have embarked on a project of convincing the Arab world of an alleged oppression of the Moslems in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> in order to invoke the sympathy of the Arabs,'' he said. He said Arabs were helping the rebels in order to `` keep <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> from the riches of the <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s ports of <LOCATION> Assab </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Massawa </LOCATION>, both in <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION>, are the only Red Sea ports not controlled by <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states. <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> would be landlocked without them. In the past, <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION> has always said Western nations supported the rebel movement. On Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION> said the rebels also had won support from leftist countries, which diplomats identified as <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. About 2,500 Cuban troops stationed in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> have refused to fight in the north. <PERSON> Mengistu </PERSON> defended his country's Marxist revolution of September 1974, calling it `` human and democratic'' and claiming it had improved the lives of the country's 42 million people. He warned that relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would be hurt if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> decides to stop annual imports of 20,000 tons of Ethiopian coffee, a move it is debating. Still, <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION> said he hopes for better ties with <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>: `` We have always pushed for better relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and I hope the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will reciprocate ... Once upon a time we were good friends.'' Western diplomats were puzzled by <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION>'s conciliatory attitude. They pointed out that <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> at the last minute caused <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistant secretary of state for <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> affairs, to cancel a visit in January when <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> announced he would not be meeting <LOCATION> Mengistu </LOCATION>. In February, <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON> said he believed <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> was not serious about improving relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Once-warm <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> relations with this East African country deteriorated after the 1974 revolution in which <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION> and a clique of fellow army officers overthrew Emperor <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Selassie </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> continued to arm the new military government until <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> in 1977. In a dramatic superpower flip-flop, the Soviets started backing <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> switched to <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Opposition leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> today criticized <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> interference in <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> politics and said only drastic changes in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy can stop a wave of anti-American sentiment in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. He said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> resent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for this country's past authoritarian regimes and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s demand that Korean markets be opened to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imports <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should not try to influence or control events in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. `` First of all, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should act up to our expectation for democratization if it wants to restore sincere ties here,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> Seoul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correspondents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. The opposition leader criticized <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> requests for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to increase its contribution to the costs of keeping about 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in the country under a mutual defense pact. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has also been pressing for greater access to South Korean markets to help reduce <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>'s $ 10 billion trade surplus with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Korean farmers strongly oppose any moves to open domestic markets for fear of hurting their business. Radical students have staged a series of protests over the past two weeks to demand the overthrow of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo and the removal of American troops. The protests have turned violent. Radicals have attacked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomatic buildings and fought police. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> said the recent protests reflected public dismay over <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policies. `` There would be no more anti-U. S sentiment as long as it remains the patron of democracy and meets the wishes of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> people,'' he Government officials and other political leaders say anti-U.S. sentiment is confined to a tiny radical minority and most South Koreans are pro-American. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> predicted that the Olympic Games in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> that begin in September will lead to ties with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and help <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> end its heavy dependence on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But he ruled out drastic changes in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in trade and other areas. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has no formal ties with communist nations because of its rivalry with communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The Soviet and Chinese decisions to attend the Olympics are expected to lead to ties. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has said it will boycott the Olympics because the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Olympic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has rejected its demand to co-host the Games. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> expressed disatisfaction with `` foot-dragging'' reforms proposed by the government and charged it with being `` insincere in liquidating the evil legacy of the previous government.'' <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> defeated <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> and other opposition candidates in the Dec. 16 presidential elections. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> said today that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> helped <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> win by inviting him to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> before the elections, giving the impression he was endorsed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s democratic development would be ensured by the political neutrality of the armed forces, which he said have been used to `` maintain the dictatorial regimes in power.'' `` I firmly believe the great bulk of the military opposed intervention in politics ... even though it still maintains considerable influence.''

<TEXT>
 A car bomb exploded in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> today, where streets were nearly empty because Moslems went on strike to mark the first anniversary of the assassination of Prime Minister <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> <PERSON> Karami </PERSON>. Police reported no injuries. A police spokesman said a white <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION> packed with 44 pounds of explosives went off at 8:20 a.m. in the <LOCATION> Bir </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hassan </LOCATION> district. `` The explosion shattered windows, but no casualties were reported, apparently because the streets were empty because of the strike,'' the spokesman said. He can not be named under standing regulations. Banks, schools, shops, government offices, gasoline stations and other businesses closed in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and other Moslem areas. <PERSON> Karami </PERSON>, a Sunni Moslem who was close to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, was killed last June 1 when a bomb exploded aboard a military helicopter that was flying him from north <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Syrian-backed Moslem leaders have blamed the assassination on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, the Christians' main militia. Both have denied involvement. An official investigation into <PERSON> Karami </PERSON>'s assassination has made no progress. Today's car bombing was the third in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this year. By police count, 89 people were killed and 189 wounded in the earlier bombings. Sixty-nine people were killed and 111 wounded April 23 in the northern port city of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Karami </PERSON>'s predominantly Sunni Moslem hometown, when a pickup truck packed with explosives went off in a crowded vegetable market. A car rigged with 220 pounds of <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION> exploded in <LOCATION> Christian </LOCATION> east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> Monday, killing 20 people and wounding 78. The Lebanese Forces blamed <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> for Monday's bombing. The blast came four days after 2,400 Syrian troops moved into <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s southern slums to end three weeks of bloody fighting between rival Shiite Moslem militias in which nearly 300 people were killed and 1,000 wounded The Christians are at odds with <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, the main power broker in this country that has been embroiled in civil strife since 1975. Christian President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> torpedoed a Syrian-brokered peace treaty in December 1985, claiming it stripped Christians of their traditional power. The Syrians control west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, most of the city's southern slums and <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s eastern and northern provinces. The Christians refuse to let the Syrians into their enclave north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Police said Syrian officers supervised an exchange of prisoners between the Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, and the pro-Syrian Amal militia in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> during the night. Police reported that <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> released 120 Amal men, while <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> freed 31 men it had captured.

The security plan also will include use of metal detectors, electromagnetic locks, and more police in certain schools, Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said Tuesday after meeting with schools Chancellor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> and other officials. In addition, <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said, the officials agreed to ask the state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> to upgrade the crime of assaulting a teacher or other public official from a misdemeanor to a felony punishable by more than a year in prison. Six teachers have been attacked during the past 1 -LCB- weeks. On Tuesday, a 27-year-old teacher was shot in the leg as she left a school in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> after dismissing her class, police said. The bullet grazed her right thigh, and she was treated at a hospital and released. The shot was fired by one of two men who were arguing nearby. The shooter was not believed to be a student, police said. Also Tuesday, a 31-year-old teacher was punched in the face by a 15-year-old student in a special education class at a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> high school, police said. The student was arrested and charged with third-degree assault and then released, said Officer <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON>, a police spokesman. `` The notion you have a right to free education is assumed,'' <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said. `` Students who violate that right by assaulting teachers or any other school personnel will forfeit that right for the rest of the school year.'' He said students who engage in anything `` beyond a normal fight will find themselves without a public education in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.'' Until now, abusive students were suspended or transferred to other schools. The city was researching whether it needs action by the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> to permit expulsions, the mayor said. The recent outbreak of school violence included a baseball-bat attack on one teacher and another who was burned when she picked up a huge firecracker tossed into her classroom. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabrino </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said that from last July 1 to April 30, there were 969 reported assaults in the city's schools, 198 on teachers. The police patrols will be instituted at the 200 schools with the highest number of serious incidents, officials said. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said metal detectors will be put in some schools on a test basis and identification cards will be issued for everyone in the school system. In addition, electromagnetic locks will be installed so that a signal will sound when outside school doors are left open, and teachers will be able to push a button in the classroom that will let the security office listen in.

 A hurricane swept across parts of <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> for two days this week, killing at least six people, injuring hundreds more and destroying thousands of homes, officials and news reports said today. A government official at <LOCATION> Gaibandha </LOCATION>, 124 miles north of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, said three people were killed and 170 injured when the storm hit the area on Monday and Tuesday. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said at least 1,500 houses, mostly made of mud and straw, were blown away. Crops over a wide area were damaged. Newspapers said at least three other people were killed in other parts of the country. Hundreds of others were reported injured, the <ORGANIZATION> Bangladesh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said. The storm followed floods in northern areas of the country, caused by the <LOCATION> Brahmaputra </LOCATION> river bursting its banks. The government says at least 13 people have been killed in the floods but local newspapers put the figure at more than 50. Floods and heavy rain are common in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> at this time of year, when the annual monsoon begins.

<HEAD>Martin Luther King Day Bill Inches Forward In Arizona</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A state holiday honoring the Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> won preliminary <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approval by one vote, but the future of the bill was uncertain. `` We'll have to see what the -LRB- Republican -RRB- caucus wants to do,'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunasek </PERSON> said after Tuesday's vote. <PERSON> Kunasek </PERSON>, a Republican who blocked a similar measure earlier this year, is not required to bring the bill to the floor for a final vote. The bill cleared the calendar for debate on a 14-13 vote Tuesday, but 16 votes are needed for final passage by the 30-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, and sponsors were unsure whether they could muster the needed support. One of the three Republican senators absent Tuesday, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mawhinney </PERSON>, has said he would vote for a holiday for the slain civil rights leader, while another, <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, opposes it. Sen. <PERSON> Jacque </PERSON> <PERSON> Steiner </PERSON> walked off the floor shortly before the measure came up, and said later she had not made up her mind how to vote. The King measure has been controversial for years in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, which has separate February holidays for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> and <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>. Many Republicans say they want to keep a separate day for each president because <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, a Republican, is important to them. The federal government has combined the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> days into a single holiday and created a day for King on the third Monday in January. The state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passed a King holiday like the federal day in 1986, but the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rejected the bill. In 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed a King holiday only to see the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bottle it up in committee. The governor at the time, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON>, then issued an executive proclamation declaring a King holiday, but his <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> successor, <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, rescinded it, citing advice from Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> who said only lawmakers could create a paid holiday for state employees. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was removed from office April 4 when the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> convicted him in an unrelated impeachment trial. House leaders said they would wait for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to act first this year, and a King bill cleared the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> government committee but was mired in the Rules Committee, which <PERSON> Kunasek </PERSON> controls. On Tuesday, three Republicans joined the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s 11 Democrats in tacking the King day provisions onto a state pension bill that had already hit the floor for debate. <PERSON> Kunasek </PERSON> said he believed the amendment might violate a provision in the state constitution requiring that each bill deal only with one subject. He said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> attorneys would examine the question. During the debate on the measure, opponents said the question should be referred to the voters. `` I have yet to see one poll where the people of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> want a paid holiday for <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>,'' said Republican Sen. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON>. Supporters said the state was losing prestige and tourist dollars because of international publicity about the controversy.

<HEAD>Unsafe Lead Levels At 40 Boston Schools</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The lead content of water exceeds federal safety standards at half the elementary schools in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> tested, according to a preliminary state report, and officials say some affected buildings will get bottled water. Samples from 40 of the 81 public and private elementary schools show higher levels of lead than the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s allowable level of 50 parts per billion, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> study released Tuesday. Nineteen schools have levels in excess of 20 parts per billion. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has been considering lowering the maximum level to 20 parts per billion. Twenty had lead in their drinking water that was less than 20 parts per billion. Further tests are scheduled to determine the source of the lead. `` This is not an issue specific to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Prenney </PERSON>, director of the state Child Lead Poison Prevention Program. `` It is an issue -LRB- that is -RRB- state and nationwide.'' School Superintendent <PERSON> Laval </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said bottled water will be supplied to the public schools with contaminated water. `` We want to make sure our young people and staff have appropriate water to drink,'' he said. State and city officials said lead poisoning rarely results from drinking water that is tainted with lead. But high levels of lead in drinking water can add to lead levels that may already be present in a child's body from other sources, such as soil or lead-based paint, the officials said. Lead poisoning is known to cause brain damage and can result in death. State officals said the test results are similar to those from tests of homes in recent years.

 <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, which re-established diplomatic ties last month, have done away with visa requirements and plan to establish air, sea, rail and telecommunications links, according to a joint announcement. Beginning Sunday, Moroccans and Algerians will be able to cross into each others' countries with a valid passport. Four frontier posts _ two in each country _ are being set up for that purpose, the statement said. The announcement came late Tuesday at the close of a one-day visit here by Algerian Interior Minister <PERSON> Hedi </PERSON> <PERSON> Khediri </PERSON>, who met with his Moroccan counterpart <PERSON> Driss </PERSON> <PERSON> Basri </PERSON>. It said a mixed committee would study how best to facilitate the passage of goods and people and re-establish air, sea, rail and telecommunication links. The report is to be submitted by July 5. The two North African countries, at odds for 12 years over the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> territory, re-established diplomatic relations on May 17. They broke diplomatic ties in 1976 after <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> recognized the <LOCATION> Saharan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Democratic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> set up by <ORGANIZATION> Polisario </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas seeking independence for the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> says he and his wife, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON>, should have a chance to salvage the failing ministry before its liquidation in bankruptcy court. `` I think everybody else has had a chance,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> told reporters Tuesday outside <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> headquarters. `` It's gone through so many regimes; it's being sold off. What would be wrong with giving <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> a chance?'' Similar previous pleas by the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> founder to leaders who succeeded him have been rebuffed. <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s opinion that <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> could never return as the ministry's leader has not changed, ministry spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON> said Tuesday <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Court Judge <PERSON> Rufus </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, who is overseeing the ministry's bankruptcy reorganization, `` agrees with the legal opinion presented by our attorneys that <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> can not return,'' <PERSON> West </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, who left the television ministry in March 1987 amid a sex-and-money scandal, returned to <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> theme park at the request of <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> <PERSON> Messner </PERSON>, its primary builder and <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s second-largest creditor <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said the meeting was to back up <PERSON> Messner </PERSON>'s claims against <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> in bankruptcy proceedings. He said he was shocked by what he heard in the meeting with <PERSON> Messner </PERSON> and attorneys for <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Messner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said most the records left behind when he left <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> were destroyed. `` Almost all of the blueprints of all the buildings are missing,'' he said. When asked who might have destroyed the records, he said, `` Any of them who might want to take over the ministry.'' Pressed for specifics, he said, `` I do n't know.'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said he wants to buy back the ministry if it is liquidated. `` I would set up offices near here, which I probably will do,'' he said. `` As every piece of ministry comes up for sale, I would buy it to restore it to the people it was meant for.'' The ministry is up to $ 130 million in debt. A reorganization plan calling for the sale of much of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s assets is up for final approval by <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> on June 16. `` I want to see the ministry restored 100 percent,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said, adding that the future `` looks bleak'' for the ministry. `` We want it brought back. We want it redeemed.'' Later, at the offices of the <ORGANIZATION> Bring </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Back </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> and Concerned <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said he was back to stay `` until <LOCATION> Heritage </LOCATION> <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> is a full Christian retreat again.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> have left their home in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, and are returning to their home in <LOCATION> Gatlinburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hovis </PERSON>. `` We are here today to say we are going back on television,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> told about 60 jubilant supporters at the <ORGANIZATION> Brinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Back </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. `` If the good folks at <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> wo n't let <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> try to save <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>, then we'll go on television ourselves out here and we will make our appeal to the nation.'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> left <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> after charges that <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>, a church secretary, was paid to keep quiet about a sexual encounter with him.

 Acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Poul </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON> prepared to form a minority government after talks on a majority coalition broke down, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s public radio said. <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON> was appointed as chief negotiator 10 days ago with the task of putting together a government program that could win approval from a majority in the Folketing, the 179-seat parliament. But the Social Democrats, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s biggest party, and <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON>'s Conservatives failed to close the gap between them on economic and defense policy. <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON>, who headed a center-right government until the inconclusive election of May 10, now has support from a majority of the eight parties to try to form a new minority coalition. After 20 days of political jockeying all attempts to build a majority government appeared doomed. The election was called following a parliamentary row over a toughening of <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s peacetime ban on nuclear arms which provoked strong objections from its <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies. Analyists predicted Tuesday that the most likely outcome would be a coalition of Conservatives, <ORGANIZATION> Liberals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberals </ORGANIZATION> commanding a total of 67 seats. But the 10-seat Social-Liberals, who hold the balance of power in the new parliament as they did in the previous one, had not decided whether to join a new <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON> administration.

 A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> official accused the Soviets today of engaging in a `` smear campaign'' by charging that a dissident who met with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was a Nazi war criminal. The allegations against <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Rozhko </PERSON>, described by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official as an American-born man living in the western <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, surfaced in Soviet state-run media Tuesday. The embassy official, who spoke on condition that he not be identified, said the Soviets disliked <PERSON> Rozhko </PERSON> because he is campaigning to emigrate, and `` is a focal point for others who want to leave.'' The Soviet charges are part of a `` smear campaign to pressure him to cease his activities,'' said the official. A student questioning <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at the president's session at <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> was swift to grill the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> leader on why he invited the German `` Polizei,'' or <LOCATION> Gestapo </LOCATION>, to his meeting. The president replied that he knew nothing about such charges. Nor did <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> when asked about <PERSON> Rozhko </PERSON> later at a news conference. But Soviet spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> reiterated charges by the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> TASS </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Rozhko </PERSON> was a war criminal who began collaborating with the Nazi police in 1942. <PERSON> Rozhko </PERSON> `` participated in the killing of Soviet partisans and the arrests and tortures of civilians -LRB- maybe Jews too? -RRB-,'' <ORGANIZATION> TASS </ORGANIZATION> said. It reported that <PERSON> Rozhko </PERSON> was sentenced to death by firing squad by a military tribunal in 1944, but that the sentence was later commuted to 20 years' imprisonment and <PERSON> Rozhko </PERSON> was released on parole in 1955 by a government decree. It gave no further background on the charges. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> source who asked not to be identified said <PERSON> Rozhko </PERSON> lives in <LOCATION> Grozdno </LOCATION>, in the western province of <LOCATION> Byelorussia </LOCATION>, a region of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> that suffered greatly after the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> invaded in 1941. Millions were killed in the occupied <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and many thousands of others jailed or executed on charges of collaborating with the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>, a charge that is viewed extremely negatively by a Soviet public constantly reminded of the nation's suffering in World War II. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> journalists who attended <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s reception for the dissidents _ which was criticized by <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> officials _ turned up the background on Rozhko by looking at Soviet records They `` were rather curious and looked into the dossier of the invited,'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> explained. `` They found out that one of them in fact was a policeman sharing in the occupation of our country by <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> ... so he was a former <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> agent and a war criminal,'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, who asked not to be identified, said <PERSON> Rozhko </PERSON> was born in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and came to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as a child with his parents. He has been trying to emigrate for the past 20 years, but the Soviets have denied him permission to leave. The source suggested that Soviet authorities have charged before that <PERSON> Rozhko </PERSON> had a Nazi background, but never presented firm proof nor implied that his history blocked his emigration. `` The Soviet government never once gave us one shred of evidence of his Nazi activities,'' the official said. `` This was not an issue -LRB- on <PERSON> Rozhko </PERSON>'s emigration -RRB- until the Soviets brought it up this week.'' The official said he was speaking without direct access to <PERSON> Rozhko </PERSON>'s file and could not give precise details on the man's background, but believed that he has a brother living in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> The official said he had the impression that <PERSON> Rozhko </PERSON> had served time in a Soviet jail, but he did not know on what charges. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s meeting with the refuseniks, unlike all other events in his program, was reported with negative comment by the Soviet media. The Communist party daily Pravda and government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday criticized <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s meeting. Referring to a speech <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> delivered to the dissidents on Monday, Pravda noted he had said `` it's time'' for more Kremlin reform. `` Indeed, it's time. Time to stop speculating on the problems of human rights using this serious question as an easy reason for self-advertisement and politicizing,'' Pravda said. <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> criticized <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogorodnikov </PERSON>, a religious activist at the meeting, <PERSON> Lev </PERSON> <PERSON> Timofeyev </PERSON>, a campaigner for press freedom, <PERSON> Rozhko </PERSON> and <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> <PERSON> Stolar </PERSON>, a 73-year-old American who has campaigned since 1975 for his family to emigrate from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Like <PERSON> Rozhko </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stolar </PERSON> was brought to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as a child by his parents.

<HEAD>Tropical Depression Greets Start Of Atlantic Hurricane Season</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CORAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The 1988 <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> hurricane season began today with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> already tracking the first tropical depression of the year. At 6 a.m. EDT, the depression's center was just south of the western tip of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, or about 150 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>. The depression, drifting toward the northeast, contained winds up to 30 mph and was not expected to strengthen. If the system's maximum sustained winds reached 39 mph, it would be called Tropical Storm <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON>. In conjunction with the start of the six-month season, the weather service released a study estimating that the death toll from a major hurricane could be far worse than previously predicted. Forty-three million people live in about 175 coastal counties from <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and evacuating crowded urban areas and barrier islands is virtually impossible, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheets </PERSON>, director of the National Hurricane Center. Recently completed hurricane coastal flood models for the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> and Gulf coasts show that many more people than earlier thought must be evacuated under certain conditions, Sheets said. Sheets said there are not enough shelters to handle the added load. And there are serious concerns how glass-windowed high-rises would fare if lashed by hurricane-force winds during the evacuations. `` We've not had a strong category three or category four hurricane of record strike a ... glass city,'' he said. During a weaker hurricane that struck <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, `` glass was flying everywhere.'' Hurricanes are rated on a one-to-five scale. Five, the most severe, has wind speeds exceeding 150 mph. The Hurricane Center director refused to make predictions about the 1988 season, saying no one has convinced forecasters they can reliably predict the number and severity of the storms. A typical <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> hurricane season, from June 1 to Nov. 30, sees 10 named tropical storms with rain and winds exceeding 39 mph. Six become hurricanes with drenching rains and winds over 74 mph, said hurricane specialist <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Case </PERSON> of the Geo-Stationary Earth-Orbiting Environmental Satellite. In 1987, there were three hurricanes and four tropical storms in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>.

 A West German pilot says bad weather caused him to fly his small plane over Soviet territory over the weekend and that his jaunt into Russian airspace was a mistake, not a political statement. <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sommer </PERSON> said he blundered across the border in bad weather Saturday in a single-engine <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> 150 and did it again on Sunday. <PERSON> Sommer </PERSON> said he did n't know that Saturday marked the first anniversary of a flight by <PERSON> Mathias </PERSON> <PERSON> Rust </PERSON>, who stunned the world by flying a light plane through Soviet air defenses to Red Square. Rust now is serving a four-year prison term in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sommer </PERSON>'s flight caused a diplomatic flurry, particularly because of suspicions the incursion had something to do with the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit between President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. He said he hopes the summit `` brings peace and detente,'' but his vacation flight had nothing to do with it. In <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Lasse </PERSON> <PERSON> Seim </PERSON> said the plane crossed the Soviet border while on a 100-mile flight from <LOCATION> Ivalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Kirkenes </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s Barents Sea coast. He said it went deeper into <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> territory when it returned to <LOCATION> Ivalo </LOCATION> on Sunday, staying in Soviet airspace for as long as 30 minutes. <PERSON> Sommer </PERSON>, a part-time <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> bus driver with 23 years as an amateur pilot, said he passed into Soviet territory both days while flying in a cloud cover at 1,000 feet. He said he said he first learned that he had strayed into Soviet territory on Sunday when Norwegian air controllers warned him: `` You are on Soviet territory. Return.'' `` The weather at the time was so bad I was prepared to land any place, but there were only lakes and forests and I decided to return to <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> immediately,'' <PERSON> Sommer </PERSON> told a reporter for the <ORGANIZATION> Aftonbladet </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. <PERSON> Sommer </PERSON> said he saw no Soviet aircraft scrambling to intercept him and had no contact with Soviet air controllers. <PERSON> Matti </PERSON> <PERSON> Autio </PERSON>, of the Finnish <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Sommer </PERSON> was questioned after landing on Sunday for deviating from his flight path, but was not detained. The Norwegian national news agency <ORGANIZATION> NTB </ORGANIZATION> quoted <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Nesteruchkin </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION> as calling the overflight a `` bad joke.'' <PERSON> Seim </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> contacted Soviet authorities on Sunday, and `` we have the impression that they followed the plane. They knew about it.'' The Aftenposten newspaper speculated that the Soviets may have refrained from shooting at the plane because of the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit. <PERSON> Seim </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> asked for a meeting with the Norwegians on Monday, when they handed over a formal protest. Rust was 19 at the time he made the flight. On Sept. 4, 1987, he was found guilty by a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> court of illegal entry into the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, violating international flight regulations and malicious hooliganism. He was sentenced to four years in a labor camp, but now is being held in a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> prison.

 <PERSON> June </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON>, an education pioneer who co-founded <ORGANIZATION> Alice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in the 1920s and was mayor of this remote Appalachian Mountain valley town, died 21 days short of her 101st birthday. Ms. <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> died of natural causes Tuesday at <LOCATION> Our </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lady </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> the </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Way </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, according to college spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Silliman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. She had been hospitalized recently for pneumonia, <PERSON> Silliman </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON>, who lived on campus and was known as `` Miss June'' by students and faculty, was to be buried this afternoon on a hill overlooking the college, beside co-founder <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>, said school President <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. `` She was a living legend,'' said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. `` You do n't replace a June Buchanan or an <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said he believed Ms. <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> was the last surviving member of a group of education pioneers who set up some of eastern <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>'s first schools after the turn of the century. The <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, native arrived in Pippa Passes in 1919 to take on the monumental task of educating a largely illiterate and isolated mountain population. Ms. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> had arrived from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> in 1916 and began operating the school out of a one-room shack in 1916. The two women founded a two-year college program at the <ORGANIZATION> Caney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Creek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in 1923. Ms. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> died in 1962. Ms. <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> oversaw the school's transition to a four-year private college in 1981. Last year, <ORGANIZATION> Alice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> reported an enrollment of 530. Ms. <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> often paid college staff members out of her own pocket when the school's funds ran low, said <PERSON> Silliman </PERSON>. She remained active in raising funds for the college until about a year ago, when health problems limited her activities. At the time of her death, Ms. <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> was a member of the board of trustees and mayor of <PERSON> Pippa </PERSON> <PERSON> Passes </PERSON>, which has about 400 residents. She is featured in a music video and docudrama about the college's origins called `` Miracle on <LOCATION> Caney </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>,'' which is to be distributed this fall to schools across <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and eventually around the nation. Ms. <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> is survived by a sister, <PERSON> Cherry </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>.

 A military court today sentenced a Lebanese man to 30 years in prison for participating in a guerrilla attack that killed three <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers on patrol in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubaba </PERSON> <PERSON> Yassin </PERSON>, 20, was the only survivor of the 10-man guerrilla band that carried out the Sept. 15 surprise attack in which five Israeli troops were also wounded.

After the sentence was read, <PERSON> Yassin </PERSON> tried to lunge at the three-judge panel. He struck a military policeman before being overcome by several other officers and led handcuffed out of court. According to the charge sheet, the guerrilla band had intended to attack an artillery emplacement belonging to Israeli-backed Lebanese militiamen inside <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-declared `` security zone.'' Instead, the guerrillas were intercepted by an Israeli patrol and a gunbattle ensued, the indictment said. Military prosecutor <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> had asked for a life sentence for <PERSON> Yassin </PERSON>, who was charged with being a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION> and a radical faction of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. The three judges said that because the band did not intend to attack Israeli forces or <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, they would sentence him to 30 years.

 Heavy thunderstorms roared across parts of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> early today, dumping heavy rainfall across a vast area and triggering flash flooding in at least 10 <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> counties. Showers and thunderstorms continued into the morning hours from western <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> across <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, eastern <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and north-central through south-central <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Rain was scattered from the northern half of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> into eastern <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION>. Local flood warnings were posted in northern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where heavy rain caused flooding and closed low-lying streets elsewhere. Overflowing creeks and streams left Highway 377 near Comanche under about 14 feet of water. Flash flooding was widespread in 10 counties, including the <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> area, and forecasters warned that other parts of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> could be in store for flooding later today as the storm system that triggered the drenching rain moved northeastward. As almost 7 inches of rain fell in sections of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> from late Tuesday through early today, flash flood watches were posted in the <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Country </LOCATION> and north-central <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, as well as in western and central <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. One person died Tuesday in a weather-related three-vehicle accident on a rain-slickened street in <LOCATION> Amarillo </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Caldwell </LOCATION>, thunderstorms produced hail and winds gusting to more than 50 mph, downing trees and power lines. In <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hatteras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, a high of 91 degrees Tuesday set a record for May 31 and marked the city's first 90-degree day for the month of May in 115 years of record-keeping.

 <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> has rejected <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> charges that officials of that Communist nation may be involved in drug trafficking. <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>' official radio said <PERSON> Harriet </PERSON> <PERSON> Isom </PERSON>, charge d'affaires of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Vientiane </LOCATION>, was presented with a letter that said the charges affected <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>' `` honor, dignity and prestige.'' The letter was quoted Tuesday in a broadcast by domestic state radio, a text of which was obtained from a Western embassy in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> today. On May 11, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said there were numerous reports that government and military officials of the <LOCATION> Lao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> People </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Democratic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> were involved in the drug trade. The spokeswoman, <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON>, said the department had submitted a report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on March 1 stating that opium cultivation and heroin production in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> had increased considerably in the past two years and the trend was likely to be irreversible. The letter said <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> was `` extremely surprised to learn this as relations between <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have been further improved another step, that is, the Lao side has done its utmost in searching for the missing Americans -LRB- from the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war -RRB- while the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has also provided humanitarian assistance for the people in the area affected by the natural disasters.'' The letter said that after the Communist government came to power in 1975, it had to deal with the consequences of the Vietnam War, including opium, marijuana and heroin addiction under the former regime. `` The Lao government has been trying to eliminate opium cultivation, provide medical treatment for drug addicts and reduce their number and come close to achieving an addiction-free society,'' it said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> narcotics officials estimate that 150-300 metric tons of opium were produced in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> in 1987, mostly by hill people for whom it is an economic mainstay. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has no narcotics control program in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, as it does in the other two countries that also are part of the major drug-producing `` Golden Triangle'' _ <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The nation's second-largest city survived May without being destroyed by a disastrous earthquake, contrary to dire predictions by astrologers and followers of the 16th-century French seer Nostradamus. That nugget of good news is followed by a dire prediction of another sort, this time from members of the scientific community who say apocalyptic prophecies are a kind of industry that thrives in trend-conscious <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Astronomer <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Fraknoi </PERSON> said he expects more somber prophecies because `` for this rather large and lucrative New Age business to keep churning out sales, they need something cosmic every year or so.'' <PERSON> Fraknoi </PERSON>, executive officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Astronomical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, blamed the attention the Nostradamus prediction got on the media for failing to emphasize that scientists said the predictions were bunk. The seismic scare was spurred by a purported prediction in vague poems by the astrologer <PERSON> Nostradamus </PERSON>, who died in 1566. In the 1981 movie, `` The Man Who Saw Tomorrow,'' <PERSON> Orson </PERSON> <PERSON> Welles </PERSON> claimed Nostradamus forecast a quake would destroy the `` new city,'' supposedly <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, when certain planets were aligned in May 1988. Psychic <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> <PERSON> Farmer </PERSON> also predicted an 8.5-magnitude quake would wreak havoc, while other psychics and astrologers offered a variety of dates for <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s demise. Much of the doomsaying focused on May 10, although <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s personal astrologer, <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON>, predicted the quake would hit May 5. The comic strip `` Doonesbury'' satirized the predictions, and scientists called the forecasts nonsense, saying <PERSON> Nostradamus </PERSON> did n't predict a quake, the planets were n't aligned and would n't trigger a quake if they were But thousands of truly fearful residents called hot lines at <ORGANIZATION> Griffith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>. Some stocked up on emergency supplies and Nostradamus books and videotapes, while others left town, including an estimated 1,000 or more Cambodian refugees who were frightened by a strong real quake that rocked <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> last October. `` We need a campaign for the media to just say no _ no astrology, no UFOs, no Bigfoot stories, no psychics,'' <PERSON> Fraknoi </PERSON> said. `` When you get tempted, just call another journalist and they'll help you just say no.'' Another figure prominent in the scientific study of the heavens criticized the prophecy business. `` We've gone through the month of May with extraordinary unfounded predictions of a catastrophic earthquake in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, and to me, this is like yelling fire in a crowded theater. Those who scared people should be ashamed of themselves,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Griffith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Krupp </PERSON>. `` There were many different people predicting every date of the month before we were done,'' <ORGANIZATION> Krupp </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. `` Perhaps to the disappointment of those who had predicted a quake and counted on one, the City of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> is still here.'' About 30 quakes occur daily in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, most too small to be felt, <ORGANIZATION> Caltech </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Finn </PERSON> said. The biggest quake all month in the region measured a barely respectable 4.0 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale on May 17, and was centered east of <LOCATION> Borrego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, about 125 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, he added. No damage or injuries were reported. <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON>, an employee at the <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> metaphysical bookstore in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION>, said the scientists `` are pretty close-minded about prophesying and forseeing the future.'' So why did <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> survive? `` From what I've heard, because I've talked to a guy who's really looked into Nostradamus, the planets do n't line up until 1999 So that's when it -LRB- the big quake -RRB- is supposed to be,'' Ms. <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON> said. `` It should occur May 10, 1999. So everybody was scared for nothing. I'm moving away in 1999.'' <ORGANIZATION> Krupp </ORGANIZATION> scoffed at that, but noted that scientists do expect a catastrophic earthquake is inevitable. The <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> says a major, devastating quake in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> is more than 50 percent likely sometime within the next 25 years. `` If there's a good side to this -LRB- Nostradmus scare -RRB-, I'd bet a lot of people stocked up on bottled water and canned food and did all the other things to prepare for an earthquake,'' <PERSON> Finn </PERSON> said.

 The long-simmering rivalry between <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> flared up anew today, with the American first lady acknowleging they were in `` Mexican standoff.'' Although the two women maintained an appearance of cordiality and near-constant smiles during a brief tour of an icon storage vault, their last one-on-one get-together of the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit erased earlier attempts to paper over the strained impasse that marks their relationship. `` I want to say something. I want to say something now, OK?'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> cut in at one point as Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> attempted to stop the press from questioning the American first lady. Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> backed away, but pointedly looked at her watch as the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> first lady chatted a bit with members of the White House press corps. The incident recalled a similar one during the December summit in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, when Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> lectured frequently on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history, art, and political life, leaving Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> attempting to get in a few words. <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s press secretary, said after the event, `` They are from two totally different worlds.'' Noting that Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has spoken out more in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> than she did at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> summit, Mrs. <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> said she believed the two women now had `` more balance'' and equality in their relationship. Instead of meeting Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as planned by the door of the vault, Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had entered first and informed the waiting press corp that they could have `` a dialogue'' about the art. `` The guests are late,'' she noted. After Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> arrived and the two women shook hands, Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> presented the first lady with a bouquet of roses and a large coffee-table style book of pictures from the gallery. She also presented reporters with a copy of the same book, proposing that they give it to `` whomever has covered the summit best.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> raised her eyebrows in a look of mild consternation. She then stepped forward, and insisted that she be given equal time with the journalists. She thanked Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and the gallery staff for making arrangements to allow her to see the now-closed museum works, and said she was aware that very few people were granted a chance to view them. When reporters tried to question the two women, Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> responded, `` We have decided there would not be any interviews. Please allow us to show Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> the remaining art.'' She retreated to the background, however, when journalists continued pressing for time with Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Told that Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had spoken at length about the icon collection, but had not mentioned it's religious heritage, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> responded, `` I do n't know how you can neglect the religious implications. I mean they are there, when you see them.'' The first lady said she was pleased with her visit, and that she hoped to return so that she might be able to view the artistic and architectural treasures of the nation once again. Asked if she'd become a convert to communism during her trip, the first lady laughed heartily, saying, `` Oh, no.'' And she said Soviets were n't ready either to convert to capitalism. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> indicated that the five-day trip, her first to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, had not changed her views. `` We have two different ways of living, two different philosphies,'' she said. Asked about her relationship with Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the first lady laughed at the maneuvering that had just occurred, shrugged, and declared, `` a Mexican standoff.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had requested a viewing of the famed icons of the Tretyakov Gallery. Since the museum has been closed for renovation, the first lady was allowed to view a collection of the art in a high-tech, temperature controlled storage vault. Even though the two women had tried to paper over the reports of a feud, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> left the impression during a day trip Tuesday to <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> that she'd just as soon let the subject drop. In a meeting with reporters aboard her plane, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> people `` are very warm and very open'' but that she was less impressed with her high-level contacts. `` Their philosophies and positions are completely different from ours,'' she said. But given the repeated hand-holding between the first ladies during a tour of Kremlin churches on Sunday and at later official functions, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was asked who started it all. `` I do n't know. It just sort of happened,'' the first lady said with a shrug of her shoulders. Although Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> declined to accompany Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>, the Soviet first lady arranged for <PERSON> Lidiya </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>, the wife of Soviet President <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>, to go instead. The first lady said she found Mrs. <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> `` very nice, very friendly, very warm.'' But asked if she had the same reaction to Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> smiled, and sat silent for a full 12 seconds pondering her answer. `` Well, she's a ... everybody's different,'' she finally said, evoking a hail of laughter from the reporters. When someone asked if Mrs. <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> lectured as much as Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> joined in the uproarious laughter. `` Just between us?'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> asked one reporter, quipping, `` How many viewers and readers do you have?'' Another long pause, ending with the plea, `` I'm desperately trying to think!''

 An acid spill at a factory released toxic fumes into the air, forcing the evacuation of up to 2,000 residents and sending 70 people to the hospital for treatment, authorities said today. The leak occurred around 6:15 p.m. Tuesday at a <ORGANIZATION> National-Standard </ORGANIZATION> wire and cable plant, and police evacuated people living within three miles of the plant, said police dispatcher <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> York </PERSON>. The area was declared safe about 9:15 p.m., and residents were allowed to return, said Mayor <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Clymer </PERSON>. Between 1,000 and 2,000 people live in the affected area in the southwestern <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> city of 15,000, according to <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Seventy people were treated for exposure to the fumes at <LOCATION> Pewating </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> but none was admitted overnight, said nursing supervisor <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON>.

 The dollar fell against most major foreign currencies in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> early today after a Japanese financial official said the currency's recent rise could be short-lived. Gold bullion, underpinned by speculative buying of platinum, leveled off in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> at the higher price of $ 457. After rising in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> late Tuesday on the back of firmer <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates, the dollar opened steady in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> today, then dropped after <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> Governor <PERSON> Satoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sumita </PERSON> told reporters he thought a sustained rise in the dollar was unlikely. Traders said the remark heightened speculation that central banks of the world's seven major industrialized nations would intervene in the market to brake the dollar. Midmorning dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Tuesday: _ 1.7225 West German marks, down from 1.7292 _ 1.4355 Swiss francs, down from 1.4437 _ 5.8055 French francs, down from 5.8215 _ 1.9328 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9333 _ 1,280.50 Italian lire, up from 1,279.95 _ 1.2330 Canadian The dollar advanced on the British pound, which dropped to $ 1.8320 from $ 1.8385.

<HEAD>Pregnant Women Given Dilantin Without Consent During Study</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDSEY TANNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Up to 240 pregnant women were given a drug linked to birth defects without their knowledge as part of a study, and officals are considering disciplining the researchers. Dilantin, a drug commonly used to treat epilepsy, was given by two <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> anesthesiologists to about 245 pregnant women to determine whether it could reduce fetal stress in Caesarean births, hospital spokesman <PERSON> Terrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said Tuesday. Five of the women had consented to participate in the hospital-approved study from September 1987 through January, said Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, chairman of the hospital's scientific committee. The other women were given the drug without their knowledge and without approval from the hospital's review board, said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, who, unlike <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, said he understood that only some of these approximately 240 women were pregnant. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dilantin </PERSON> has been linked to birth defects when administered early in pregnancy. But he said the women received the drug 15 minutes before delivering their babies. The president of the <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees the hospital, said he would hold a meeting Monday to discuss punishment for the doctors, who have not been identified. `` I was appalled to think that men in the medical profession would do that,'' board President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunne </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` They, of all people, should know that you do n't experiment on patients without obtaining their written consent.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, which regulates the licensing of hospitals, is aware of the doctors' action but is barred by state law from revealing whether it is investigating, said spokeswoman Penny Strong. Spokesman <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> state's attorney's office declined to comment on whether his office was investigating to see if criminal laws were violated The women all received a single, smaller-than-normal dose of the drug, <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said. Two of the babies died because of unrelated complications, <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said. Several studies have reported higher incidences of birth defects, including heart abnormalities and retardation, among babies born to women who use Dilantin and other anti-epileptic drugs. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said he did not agree with the doctors' actions but did not consider them unethical. But a medical ethicist called the practice a `` serious abuse'' of the medical profession. `` It seems to me that it simply goes against the principles of biomedical ethics ... -LRB- which -RRB- really require that any person enrolled in a research project be informed of that and be given a chance to consent or refuse,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Childress </PERSON>, a religion and medical education professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION>. `` What it amounts to -LRB- is -RRB- ... basically using human beings as means to other ends ... not treating them as ends in themselves,'' he said. `` Even though the risk was limited, it was still a serious abuse.'' <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said the failure to gain the women's consent was a violation of hospital policy. The hospital's executive medical staff recommended May 18 that the doctors be given probation, a warning that would pave the way for stricter measures if they further violate hospital policy, <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said. `` An ultimate decision -LRB- on what action is taken against the doctors -RRB- would rest with the board of trustees,'' which is to meet Monday, <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said none of the women has sued the hospital.

<TEXT>
 A passenger train slammed today into the back of a gravel-laden freight train on a main line in southwestern <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, killing two people and injuring 20, a Dutch railway spokesman said. The cause of the collision, the country's worst in nearly six years, was not immediately known, said spokesman <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Meijer </PERSON>. One of the dead was believed to be the passenger train's engineer, <PERSON> Meijer </PERSON> said The other had not been identified. Two of the injured passengers were in serious condition, said <PERSON> Meijer </PERSON>. The accident occurred at about 10:40 a.m. when a four-car passenger train slammed into the stationary freight train, <PERSON> Meijer </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from the railway's head office in this central Dutch city. The passenger train, whose speed could not immediately be established, was on its way from <LOCATION> Roosendaal </LOCATION>, a major junction 60 miles south of <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>, to <PERSON> Vlissingen </PERSON> in the province of <LOCATION> Zeeland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Meijer </PERSON> said. Visibility was good at the site of the accident between the stations of <LOCATION> Rilland-Bath </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Krabbendijke </PERSON>, where the double-track Roosendaal-Vlissingen main line runs in a slight bend, he said. `` We have n't been able to establish why the gravel train was standing still at that particular point, and why the engineer of the passenger train did n't see it, or whether the signals failed,'' <PERSON> Meijer </PERSON> said. The Roosendaal-Vlissingen line is equipped with automatic signals. Both tracks were blocked by the wreckage of both trains, <PERSON> Meijer </PERSON> said, adding that the damage to the line and the overhead power lines was considerable. Fatal train collisions are rare on the technically advanced Dutch railway network, which is one of the busiest in the world. The last serious train accident occurred in December 1982, when three passengers were killed in a collision near the port city of <LOCATION> Rotterdam </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Number of Soviet Jewish Dropouts Reaches Record High</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS 5 grafs to UPDATE with figures from Geneva group.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The number of Soviet Jewish emigrants who decided against coming to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> reached a record high in May, when more than 90 percent chose to settle elsewhere, a Soviet Jewish activist told the Israeli newsagency <ORGANIZATION> Itim </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Chessler </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewry </ORGANIZATION>, was quoted as saying Tuesday that soon no Soviet Jewish emigrants will come to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> unless they are flown via <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, instead of <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, where they are free to immigrate to other Western countries. Israeli officials are embarrassed by the high dropout figure because of their 20-year-long battle for the right of Soviet Jews to emigrate on the grounds that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is their homeland. Israeli leaders claim 400,000 Soviet Jews want to settle in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. But less than 20 percent of those who leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> actually settle here. <PERSON> Chessler </PERSON> said that of the 1,169 Jews who left the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in May, just 110 came to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, a drop of nearly 7 percent from April. Of the 4,695 Soviet Jews who have emigrated so far this year, 18 percent have settled in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, he added. Meanwhile, in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Intergovernmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Migration </ORGANIZATION> announced that Jewish emigration from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> through <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, reached a new seven-year high in May, when 1,145 Jews arrived at that city's transit center. May marked the fourth straight month of rising Jewish emigration through <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, bringing the total for 1988 to 4,547 Soviet Jews arriving there, the committee said. The figure was the highest since April 1981, when 1,155 Jews left the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> through the Austrian capital. More than 250,000 Jews have found new homes since the committee began its resettlement program in 1971. The committee did not include figures for the number of Soviet Jews coming through <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shmuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Binsky </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Soviet Jewry in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> said 24 Jews emigrated through <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> in May.

<TEXT>
 Here at a glance are some of the key points raised by Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> during his news conference Wednesday.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>U.S.-SOVIET RELATIONS AND ARMS CONTROL</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> noted that developments have become possible `` due to realism'' but that it is `` not an easy process at all.'' The 24-page document agreed at this meeting lays `` bricks so to say for the building of our future relationship. It is a sign for movement into the 21st century.'' The exchange of ratification documents on the intermediate-range weapons treaty `` turned the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> meeting into a watershed political event in the Soviet-American dialogue and in world politics as a whole.'' Yet he said it is not easy to make progress on strategic arms, calling negotiations on this issue `` the most complex task we confronted in post-war politics.'' `` Step by step, we are moving towards a treaty.'' But he strongly criticized the contrary attitude that he said had led to last-minute difficulties on agreeing the text of the joint statement. `` I believe that we have missed a chance to take an important step forward toward civilized relations,'' he said. He added however, that `` even though not everything has been achieved as we would have wanted it, we will not make any dramatic conclusions.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>HUMAN RIGHTS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said `` there has been some progress in this sense,'' using wording that suggested resolution of some individual cases. But he strongly criticized what he called `` propaganda gambits'' and `` all sorts of spectacles, all sorts of shows'' in apparent allusion to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s meeting Monday with dissidents and refuseniks. `` I'm not filled with admiration for this part of the visit,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> added. He noted that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had had a chance to get to know Soviet people and emphasized that the president, asked on Tuesday whether he still stuck to his March 1983 view of the <ORGANIZATION> Svoiet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> as an `` evil empire,'' had said he did not. `` He said no and he said this within the walls of the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, right in the heart of the evil empire,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. `` We take note of this.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s `` evil empire'' comment sparked a torrent of vicious comment when it was made, leading to an escalation in Soviet attacks that culminated in comparision between <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> in the deep freeze that followed the shooting down of the Korean Air liner in September 1983 and the breaking off of arms talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in November that year.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>REGIONAL CONFLICTS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 On the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said for the first time that as soon as an international conference on the region is convened, `` we are prepared to address ourselves to regularizing relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' severed in 1967. In general, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said `` real possibilities have appeared for solving regional problems,'' but gave no specifics. He cited the <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> agreement as an example of what could be achieved if the superpowers worked together with warring parties to solve the conflicts, but noted that if Soviet forces now come under attack from rebels as they withdraw, `` we shall react accordingly and appropriately. That should be absolutely clear.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>JACKSON-VANIK AMENDMENT</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 After talking about what he called the contrary attitude of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on some issues, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> singled out economic relations. `` Authoritative parts of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> business circles would like to do business. They are faced with intimidation and all sorts of restrictions,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. Alluding to the Jackson-Vanik amendment, he said, `` There is indeed a most unfavored nation status with regard to the treatment of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' `` Why should the dead drag on the coattails of the living? One is physically dead, the other is politically dead. The amendment was passed in totally different circumstances a decade ago. We should base our policies on present-day realities.'' The amendment, passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1974, requires that any communist nation give assurance of free emigration to be entitled to most-favored-nation trade status.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, at an impasse this week on strategic arms negotiations, celebrated a past summit success today by exchanging final ratification documents on last December's pact on intermediate-range weapons. But they deadlocked on the explosive issue of space-based defenses and failed to take steps to cut concentrations of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and Western troops in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` We have missed a chance to take an important step forward,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told reporters. While accusing <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> of `` incomprehensible maneuvers'' on conventional forces, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also registered a lack of progress in settling a long-standing dispute over the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Strategic Defense Initiative. He said he had proposed an exchange of data and cross-visits to facilities where technology for an anti-missile defense is tested. But he said the problem remained in the path of a new treaty and a fifth summit meeting at which it would be signed. At a glittering ceremony in the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vladimir </LOCATION>'s Hall, though, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> signed documents to put their 1987 treaty to ban intermediate-range missiles in force. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> called the accord a `` first step toward a brighter future, a safer world,'' while <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> declared `` the era of nuclear disarmament has begun.'' The Soviet leader said he and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had agreed at their fourth summit meeting that `` the immediate task before us'' was to complete the START treaty to sharply reduce strategic nuclear weapons. `` It can and must be accomplished,'' he said. Future American and Soviet leaders can not reverse course, the 57-year-old <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think anyone can close that book and put it aside.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> agreed. `` We must not stop here,'' he said. `` There is much more to be done.'' He said a joint statement to be issued later in the day would reflect `` more progress has been made toward a strategic arms treaty in our meetings.'' As the two leaders put the unprecedented ban on medium-range missiles and monitoring program into effect, they set the set the stage for <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> monitors to take up stations in each other's lands to guard against cheating. Two <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders, Democrat <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> and Republican <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, told reporters the so-called INF agreement was a crowning achievement for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. But both said he should move cautiously on the more extensive strategic arms pact. `` Let's not have a framework adopted that lock us in,'' said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> are expected to issue a joint communique before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s departure Thursday that, among other things, would note progress that has been made in the U.S.-Soviet relationship since <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> took the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> helm in 1985 and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ceased calling <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> the `` evil empire. And despite the failure to reach a breakthrough in arms control, the two sides made some headway on a stubborn issue: how to keep track of each other's elusive mobile missiles in the event of a new accord. `` We think we have most of the elements,'' Secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said in a CBS-TV interview. `` We're presenting it to the Soviets. Some of the elements they've accepted.'' <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, the president's national security adviser, told <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> that `` there's been quite a lot of convergence in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet thinking on the verification of mobile missiles. So we ` ve made progress.'' But, <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said, `` not enough to say that the treaty is at hand.'' <PERSON> Anf </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said unless the Soviets stop trying to block the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Star Wars program, `` obviously we ca n't get an agreement.'' The treaty the leaders are exchanging is the first in history to abolish an entire category of nuclear weapons. It was ratified last Friday by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and 17 hours later by the Soviet Presidium. It bans all missiles in the range of 300 to 3,400 miles. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, who arrived here Tuesday with <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> to mark the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s ratification of the INF accord, said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s `` discipline and strength'' prodded the Soviets to negotiate the accord `` I do n't believe anyone else could have done that,'' he said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> called the treaty `` probably the highlight of his second term. It is a small step, but it is a step towards arms reduction.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had hoped to complete a vastly more important treaty to reduce <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet armories of long-range bombers, land-based missiles and nuclear submarines by 30 to 50 percent, but disputes over verifying the pact and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Star Wars program spoiled the plan. Instead, they separated out a single provision for advance notification of missile launch tests. It was signed Tuesday. They instructed their senior negotiators to make as much progress as they could on the obstacles to a Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty -LRB- START -RRB- and left open the possibility of a fifth summit meeting to sign it before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> leaves office in January. Progress on the proposed START treaty came on a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal for verifying limits on mobile missiles and a compromise on counting air-launched cruise missiles, said a senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, who spoke on condition he not be further identified. But no progress was reported on <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION>, the main impediment to a START agreement to cut to cut long-range weapons. At the December summit, both leaders said they hoped to sign a strategic arms pact in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, but talks stalled over <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION>, mobile missiles, rules on counting cruise missiles aboard warplanes, curbs on cruise missiles on submarines, and a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> call to phase out heavy Soviet SS-18 missiles. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> expressed exasperation at the pace of the talks, although both sides said they hoped the treaty could be signed by the end of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> presidency. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he would not bargain away <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION>, formally known as the Strategic Defense Initiative. `` It's never been a part of the negotiations,'' said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Because of difficulties in counting mobile missiles, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had wanted to ban them, although it is developing one, the Midgetman. The Soviets declined to get rid of their two mobile missiles, the SS-24 and SS-25. During the summit, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> negotiators offered a proposal they had been working on for months, to restrict mobile missiles to carefully defined geographical areas, dubbed `` garrisons,'' which would be monitored by on-site inspection as well as surveillance from spy satellites. `` The Soviets reacted positively to our proposal,'' said a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, speaking not for attribution.

<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> has reluctantly allowed prosecutors to use handwriting analysis in selecting jurors but warned of a possible `` chilling effect.'' `` Citizens may shy away from jury service if they know part of serving is to have a determination made from their handwriting that they are such things as ` sexually frustrated' or ` not a hugger,''' the court said Tuesday. Despite its worries, the court refused to order a new trial in a burglary case in which handwriting analysis was used in picking jurors. The defendant, <PERSON> Merle </PERSON> <PERSON> LeRoy </PERSON> <PERSON> Knerr </PERSON>, had claimed that prosecutors had gained an unfair advantage. In refusing to order a new trial, the court said it is `` a recognized practice for an attorney to make investigations of prospective jurors.'' To warrant a new trial, it must be shown that prosecutors took part in `` systematic and intentional exclusion of an identifiable eligible group,'' the court said. At the same time, the court said of handwriting analysis, `` After reviewing the information presented by the expert we find it to be of very minimal benefit to the jury selection process.'' The appellate court also noted that it's already tough to get citizens to accept jury duty. `` We have concern that the knowledge such procedures are used to uncover information on jurors could have a chilling effect on citizens' response to the call for jury service,'' the court said. `` Additionally, because of the number of persons employed in the county attorney's office there is the possibility of inadvertent disclosure.''

<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said today tear gas fired by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers has killed 11 Palestinians, including a seven-day-old infant, and has caused dozens of miscarriages since an Arab uprising began six months ago. A spokesman for the army said the report was being checked. New figures released by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials, meanwhile, indicate the casualty toll in the uprising in the Israeli-occupies territories is higher than previously believed. The army said Tuesday that 207 Palestinians had been killed, including 157 by gunfire from <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> says 199 Arabs have been killed, 11 of them from tear gas. A left-wing legislator quoted a confidential document as saying 5,133 Arabs have been injured since the uprising began Dec. 8. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> called the tear gas report `` a matter of concern to us.'' `` We have repeatedly urged the government of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to use non-lethal means to control violent demonstrations,'' she said. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, spokesman for the U.N. Relief and <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said most of the tear gas casualties were a result of the crowd control gas being fired into closed rooms such as shelters, clinics and homes, by troops dispersing demonstrators. He said 1,285 Palestinians from refugee camps in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> were treated in hospitals for breathing problems caused by the tear gas. `` The gas is not normally lethal when used according to prescribed directions, but it can be when fired into enclosed spaces,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said. The 11 fatalities were reported through the end of April by doctors who work in clinics in <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> administered refugee camps, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said. He said most of those killed were either infants, one as young as seven days, or people over 65. Also among the victims was a 35-year-old woman in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> who died along with her unborn child after going into labor prematurely as a result of inhaling tear gas, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said. Palestinian hospital officials have repeatedly claimed that <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers were using a new, more toxic gas on demonstrators. Israeli army officials denied it. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said the gas used by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> apparently causes muscle spasms which can trigger early labor or miscarriage, and that dozens of such cases have been reported in the occupied territories. Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiddlestone </PERSON>, director of health affairs for the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agency that aids Palestinians, said in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> on April 14 after visiting the occupied territories that the Israelis were using a gas against Palestinians that causes abdominal pain, miscarriage and muscular weakness. `` I am a physician and people are having symptoms other than normal tear gas symptoms,'' he said. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spokeswoman, said the gas sold to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is commonly used by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> police and the military. She said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> firms had obtained government export licenses to sell the gas. The army's death toll of 207 Palestinians was not explained and brought the toll beyond the 199 counted by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. The army said it was still investigating how 50 of the 207 died. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> statistics indicate 167 Palestinians have been fatally shot by Israeli troops during the uprising and that 11 were killed by Jewish settlers. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said the rest died from tear gas, beatings and other means. The left-wing member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Dedi </PERSON> <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON>, quoted a top defense official as saying military `` harassment and maltreatment'' of <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> was the chief reason that unrest continues in the occupied lands. <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON> of the liberal <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> said the official, whom he refused to identify, spoke during a meeting with several legislators. <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON> also quoted a confidential government document as saying 5,133 Palestinians have been injured in the uprising. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> told a closed-door meeting of legislators that the `` Intifadeh -LRB- uprising -RRB- has only cooled off on the surface while underneath the goals are glowing as hot as before,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> daily reported today. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> who held two meetings in the past week with pro-Jordanian moderate Palestinians, said Tuesday he would continue such talks `` even with people who hold extreme views.'' He told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> he decided to arrange the talks because he was convinced the Palestinians now realized that `` with stones and firebombs they can achieve nothing.''

<HEAD>American Named Best Sommelier Of French Wines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 American <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said today he won the second international competition for best sommelier in French wine and spirits by using his creativity to defeat a Frenchman. `` The judgment was very close, but I clearly won,'' he said of the two-day competition, which ended Monday night. `` Over the two days there were many opportunities to make mistakes and I made less.'' Frenchman <PERSON> Philippe </PERSON> <PERSON> Faure-Brac </PERSON> placed second and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Mitsuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kogai </PERSON> of the Prince Hotels in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> placed third. The competition, decided by a panel of international judges, was organized by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Masters </ORGANIZATION> in French Gastronomy and the Union of French Wine Stewards. It included tests of technical knowledge of French wines and vineyards, blind taste tests and harmony between wines and dishes. Stone, 36, has been sommelier since 1984 at the Four Seasons Olympic Hotel in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. He was named best sommelier in French wine and spirits in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1986 and three times has received the Wine Spectator Award of Excellence. <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said being creative helped him win. `` In the marriage of food and wine -LRB- category -RRB-, you have to be especially imaginative and relaxed and deal with the panel like you were dealing with customers ... find new ideas, new combinations of food and wine,'' he said in a telephone interview. `` The judges do n't want to be bored. They want to be surprised.'' Asked about winning over a Frenchman, he said, `` I think the French are finding that surprising and maybe disappointing.'' <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said he had no one favorite wine. `` It's like saying one prefers just one kind of music. You ca n't restrict yourself. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> wines `` are in the top caliber,'' he said, adding that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state `` has some great Cabernets.'' But choosing one wine, `` would be like a father who has a favorite child.''

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said today he has found a new breed of leadership in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> that has eased differences between the superpowers but his policy remains: `` trust but verify.'' His fourth summit with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> over, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told a windup news conference in <LOCATION> Spasso </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION>, home of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> ambassadors in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, `` I am never going to relax my belief in the need for verification.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> acknowledged that his view of the Soviets has changed, but he said that was due to changes within the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leadership and not his own personal beliefs. The president was reminded that at his first news conference in the White House in 1981 he said that <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leaders are willing to lie and cheat in pursuit of world domination. Asked if that was still his view, he said in 1981 he had merely been quoting what <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leaders themselves had said.

 Sinhalese extremists bombed a government building, torched trains and forced shops to close in southern and central <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> today to disrupt provincial elections, authorities said. The government ordered police to shoot anyone causing a disturbance. At least five people were injured when a bomb exploded in a government building at <LOCATION> Nuwara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eliya </LOCATION> town, 64 miles east of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, according to officials in the capital who spoke on condition of anonymity. There were no other reports of casualties. However, offficials said the explosions and fires damaged three trains bound for <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, halting or delaying some rail service. Reports reaching the capital said government buildings and buses were set ablaze in several towns in southern and central <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. In some places, extremists disrupted water, electricity and communication lines, the officials said. State-run radio made special announcements that police and security forces had been ordered to shoot anyone causing disturbances. In <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, several shopkeepers closed their stores after posters were shoved under their doors warning that they would be attacked by <ORGANIZATION> Sinhalese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> members if they conducted business. Police said posters also had appeared in southern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> stating that the front had ordered residents to stay at home beginning this afternoon. Police and other authorities said the front was trying to disrupt Thursday's voting. The front has opposed the elections, which are part of a peace plan aimed at ending the nearly five-year Tamil separatist insurgency on the island. A general manager for the railway department, G.P.S. <PERSON> Weerasooriya </PERSON>, said fires broke out on two trains approaching <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. He said the fires disrupted rail service to outlying areas. <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayupala </PERSON>, a police official in <LOCATION> Panadura </LOCATION> town, said front members exploded a bomb on another train and removed railway ties and spikes from the tracks. Residents in three of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s nine provinces went to the polls April 28 to chose district councils in voting won by the governing <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The western and central provinces vote Thursday for members of local government councils and the southern province votes June 9. Dates for polls in the Tamil-dominated northern and eastern provinces have not been announced. The Sinhalese front says the Indian-brokered peace accord signed in July gives too many concessions to the Tamils, who form 18 percent of the country's 16 million people. Sinhalese comprise 75 percent of the population. The Sinhalese front has threatened to kill anyone who supports the peace plan. Tamil rebels launched their separatist struggle in 1983, claiming discrimination by the Sinhalese. The peace plan calls for the formation of district councils to give additional powers to the provinces, and in effect gives the Tamils more control. The Tamil rebels renounced the pact last year, saying it did not go far enough.

<HEAD>Report: $3 Billion Treasure About Sunken Portuguese Ship</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A sunken 16th century Portuguese ship discovered off in waters between <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> carries about $ 3 billion in gold and precious stones, a newspaper reported today. The haul is `` believed to be one of the biggest lost treasures of the world,'' the chief minister of <LOCATION> Malacca </LOCATION> state, <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Thamby </PERSON> <PERSON> Chik </PERSON>, was quoted as saying. The official, quoted by the daily <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Straits </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, reported the treasure was on board the remains of <PERSON> Flor </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Mar </PERSON>, once the flagship of the <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> navy in the area. It struck a reef and sank in the Straits of <LOCATION> Malacca </LOCATION> in January 1512, a few months after an 800-ship Portuguese armada captured the <LOCATION> Malacca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sultanate </LOCATION>. The ship, with a cargo he estimated at $ 3 billion, also carried Malay weavers and women, he said. <PERSON> Rahim </PERSON> said he had held talks with a salvage group this week, but would not identify the company or disclose further details about its location, the newspaper said. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bernama </ORGANIZATION>, The Star and other dailies also reported that <PERSON> Rahim </PERSON> said the ship has been found and that <LOCATION> Malaysian </LOCATION> officials and those of an unidentified foreign country have been contacted in connection with salvaging the treasure. Other officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the foreign government is believed to be <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> and the treasure is lying off the coast of the <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Sumatra </LOCATION> in the Straits of <LOCATION> Malacca </LOCATION>. The state minister was quoted Tuesday in <LOCATION> Malacca </LOCATION>, about 90 miles south <LOCATION> Kuala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lumpur </LOCATION>. A spokesman at his home said `` he had gone out'' today and could not be contacted. The Portuguese remained in the <LOCATION> Malacca </LOCATION> region of <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> for 100 years until the Dutch conquered it in 1641. The British landed in <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> in 1786 and then took control of the region. <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malacca </LOCATION> got independence from the British in 1957. <LOCATION> Malacca </LOCATION> is a state of <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>. The island of <LOCATION> Sumatra </LOCATION> is about 40 miles across the Straits of <LOCATION> Malacca </LOCATION> from the state. <PERSON> Rahim </PERSON> said the salvage group has agreed to finance the salvaging of the treasure. But he said international laws stipulate that treasures found at the bottom of the sea should be divided among the country of origin of the treasure, the country where the treasure was found and the finder of the treasure. The Malaysian government will not pay any cost for the salvage other than providing protection for the team, he said.

<HEAD>Yugoslav Communist Party Ends Conference With Upbeat Statement</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> ended a three-day conference by issuing an upbeat statement on the nation's economic crisis that failed to criticize party leaders, as delegates had demanded `` The party is capable of seeking and finding a way out of the political and economic crisis,'' said a 38-page document issued Tuesday at the end of the conference, according to the official <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency. The statement also directed `` competent institutions and organs to complete the reform of the economic system, based on strong orientation toward market economy, by the end of the year,'' the news agency said. At least four delegates, among 40 who objected to the final text, said it failed to single out party leaders responsible for the economic crisis. `` We have discussed one thing for three days and put down a different thing in this document,'' one delegate, <PERSON> Predrag </PERSON> <PERSON> Zivanovic </PERSON>, said. Many of the 800 delegates at the conference had accused the party leadership of bungling and demanded their resignation. Some delegates said the failure to solve economic problems was destroying public trust in the party. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> launched on Saturday its latest economic austerity program designed to cope with a foreign debt of $ 21 billion, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s highest annual inflation at 170 percent and an unemployment rate of 15 percent. Economic problems have caused increasing social and labor unrest. Last year there were more than 1,500 strikes involving more than 300,000 workers who protested low and declining standards of living. `` Young people are reluctant to join the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> because they have no confidence in our organization,'' <PERSON> Metka </PERSON> <PERSON> Tekavcic </PERSON>, a Slovenian delegate, declared during one debate at the conference. Fewer than 10 percent of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s 23 million people belong to the party and the number has been declining rapidly. In the opening speech of the conference on Sunday, party chief <PERSON> Bosko </PERSON> <PERSON> Krunic </PERSON> rejected calls for a multiparty system. He also predicted there will be new `` social upheavals'' once the austerity measures, which include sharp price rises and wage controls, begin to affect the nation. The measures were recommended by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>. Some delegates also called for an extraordinary party congress, but <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Brigic </PERSON>, a Presidium member, said such a conngress would imply `` doubt that the plans of this party conference will be materialized,'' the news agency said. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commmittee </ORGANIZATION> alone will determine the leaders responsible for the economic crisis if there is no improvement by year's end. Before the document was adopted, <PERSON> Drasko </PERSON> <PERSON> Milicevic </PERSON>, a representative of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> said it has `` too many words, too many ` one should,' ` one needs,' ` one must' ... the words we have all become tired of.'' He demanded `` a drastic reduction'' of the text to two or three pages _ `` with clear tasks.''

 Videotape retailers plan to use private detectives and a boycott threat to strike back at a group that says it will picket their stores in support of stricter anti-obscenity laws taking effect today. The <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> Cleanup Project plans to protest at about 50 stores throughout the state Saturday to urge enforcement, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinrich </PERSON>, director of the anti-pornography organization. The amended law specifically includes videotapes in its definition of materials that may be banned as obscene. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballstadt </PERSON>, president of a firm that runs 10 videotape stores in the Minneapolis-St. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> area, said store operators would retaliate by hiring detectives and tracing protesters' license plates to find where they are employed Letters will be sent to the employers telling them their products will be boycotted because of their employees' activities, he said. `` If these people think they can walk around and express their freedoms, which they have a right to do, they're going to have to pay a price, just as we have to,'' <PERSON> Ballstadt </PERSON> said. At issue are amendments approved by the 1988 Legislature to bring the state's law into conformity with obscenity rulings of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. `` The changes technically are not that great, but they do provide some tools for prosecutors to use,'' said state Solicitor General <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>. The previous law provided only for civil penalties; the new law provides for criminal penalties, he said. Conviction on a first offense carries up to one year in prison, a $ 3,000 fine or both. Subsequent convictions carry a prison term of up to two years, a fine of up to $ 10,000 or both. <PERSON> Heinrich </PERSON>, whose group is an affiliate of the <ORGANIZATION> Berean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, a conservative <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> lobbying organization, said, `` Anything on film or video is more enticing than a still picture, and this material is readily available to children of all ages and people of all ages.'' The protesters, <PERSON> Heinrich </PERSON> said, will picket `` major hard-core pornography outlets'' that have refused to remove what the group considers obscene materials from their shelves.

<HEAD>Drug and Alcohol Testing Of All Recruits Starts Today</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> begins testing all military recruits for drug and alcohol abuse today. All enlisted recruits as well as officer candidates applying to the military academies and <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Officer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> program will be tested for alcohol, marijuana and cocaine. Applicants attempting to join the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and the reserves also will be tested. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> ordered the drug testing program last December when it approved the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s fiscal 1988 budget bill, requiring that it start by the first week of June. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> decided last January to start the testing at military processing stations around the country on June 1. `` Positive findings for marijuana and alcohol will result in an enlistment ineligibility for six months on the first test,'' the guidelines state. `` Positive findings for cocaine will result in an enlistment ineligibility for one year. A positive second test on any of the three drugs will result in a two-year period of enlistment ineligibility.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> signed up almost 317,000 recruits in fiscal 1987. The testing has been opposed by some officials in the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on grounds it is too expensive as well as unnecessary, since all military personnel on active duty face random drug tests at any time. A teen-ager planning to join the military can abstain from drugs for a brief time and probably pass the test, noted one manpower official, who asked not to be named. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approved a budget amendment sponsored by Sen. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, who said that `` a drug-screening program is logical and long overdue.'' `` The time to start catching the users is before they join the armed forces, when the government has no obligation to them,'' <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, in setting out test guidelines, concluded recruits should be tested `` for drug and alcohol use during their pre-enlistment physical examinations,'' using a breathalyzer or blood alcohol test for alcohol detection and urinalysis for marijuana and cocaine detection. The standard for alcohol impairment will be a blood alcohol level of .05, the directive said.

<HEAD>Church of England Drops Commentary Linked to Cleric's Suicide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> is dropping the traditional anonymous commentary from its next clerical directory because of the suicide of a theologian who used it to lambast Archbishop of Canterbury <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON>, officials said today. The Church Commissioners and the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION>, which together oversee church investments and assets, said the commentary was `` no longer a viable option.'' <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> canon <PERSON> Gareth </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, 68, was found dead Dec. 7, five days after publication of his preface in the 1987-88 edition of the directory. The essay accused <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> of being indecisive and overly liberal. Although the article was unsigned, suspicion quickly fell on <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> because of his stature as a leader of the church's conservative wing It was widely interpreted as the opening shot in a campaign to pressure <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> into retirement and to block any attempt to replace him with a liberal. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> was found dead in the garage of his home with a hose leading into his car from the exhaust. Church officials later confirmed that he wrote the preface. The Church Commissioners and <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> said they considered the possibility of publishing a signed commentary in <LOCATION> Crockford </LOCATION>'s Clerical Directory, but decided against it. The essay will be dropped from the 1989-90 edition of <PERSON> Crockford </PERSON>'s, the official biannual list of Anglican clergy, but no decision has been made on whether to eliminate it permanently, a joint statement said.

 Hundreds of enraged <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> workers broke into the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> today, smashing windows and clashing with police who fired tear gas to disperse the crowd, police said. A <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> police spokesman said five policemen were injured slightly and four demonstrators were detained. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> army radio said 15 workers were injured by tear gas inhalation and several ministry officials were injured by broken glass. The violence started when 400 workers from Beit Shemesh Engines, the nation's largest producer of airplane engines, demonstrated near the ministry to protest the breakdown of talks on compensation for 260 workers laid off from their jobs. `` The workers did not obey our orders and overturned a police barrier, lightly injuring five officers,'' Lt. <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Lapidot </PERSON> said. `` Then several dozen broke into the ministry, smashing windows and plants.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said the workers set a fire outside the building, then used a garbage can to force open the door and vandalize the ministry. <PERSON> Lapidot </PERSON> said police fired tear gas grenades to break up the clash. The radio said paramilitary border police and mounted police were also called in. `` We do not fear tear gas,'' <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>, head of the workers' committee, shouted through a megaphone as he led the workers to another protest in front of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s nearby parliament building No further violence was reported. The ministry's deputy director, <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Medina </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> the demands of the workers were `` highly exaggerated'' and could not be met. Ministry spokesman <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Feinberg </PERSON> would not disclose specific details of the labor talks.

 <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> today condemned rebel attacks on Soviet troops withdrawing from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and said it `` should be absolutely clear'' that his forces would respond to any further assaults. He also told a televised news conference at the close of his summit talks with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will consider restoring diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as soon as an international conference on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> is convened. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> indicated, however, that disagreements over Palestinian representation and other issues still block agreement on calling an international conference. The Kremlin severed relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1967 over <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s six-day war against its Arab neighbors. At separate post-summit news conferences, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> both cited the agreement on a Soviet withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> as an example of how the superpowers can help settle regional conflicts by working with parties that are directly involved. But <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> noted Afghan rebel attacks on Soviet troops and the embassy in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, including one attack near <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> on Tuesday in which several Soviet soldiers died. If Soviet forces come under attack as they withdraw, `` we shall react accordingly and appropriately,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. `` That should be absolutely clear.'' A senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, speaking only on condition that he not be identified, said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> clearly meant that his army would return fire if attacked by Moslem rebels battling the Soviet-backed government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. This official said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> complained to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> during their summit talks about the attacks on withdrawing Soviet troops. At the same time, however, Soviet chief of staff Marshal <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON> outlined details of the schedule for withdrawal of an estimated 115,000 troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by Feb. 15. The Soviets recently disclosed that 311 of their soldiers were missing in action there. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students Tuesday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was willing to assist efforts to find the missing troops. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said today that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and Pakistani authorities had been contacted and that `` we shall do all we can to return these people to their homes.'' On the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said `` there has been a drawing closer of our positions'' with superpower agreement on the need for an international conference. Problems of Palestinian representation and an agenda are still to be resolved, he said. `` We've given the Americans several years of opportunity to go it alone'' in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. `` They saw that they could n't.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told reporters that `` real possibilities have appeared for solving regional problems,'' but neither he nor <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> discussed details of their discussions on <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> concluded four days of summit talks today with an impasse on a major arms control agreement but muted differences on human rights. The Soviet leader called their meetings `` a blow to the foundations of the Cold War'' and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said `` we must not stop here.'' In remarks after their formal talks ended with smiles and handshakes, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had disavowed his description of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as an `` evil empire,'' and noted with satisfaction that he did it `` within the walls of the Kremlin.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in turn praised <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s moves to open up his country's society to the point of suggesting that Soviet refusal to permit thousands of dissidents to emigrate over a period of several decades may be due to an unresponsive bureaucracy rather than deliberate government policy. Asked at a news conference if he was n't letting <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> off a little too easy on that score, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> replied, `` I just have to believe that in any sort of government some of us do find ourselves bound in by bureaucracy.'' Both men vowed to persist in efforts to negotiate a new treaty calling for sweeping reductions in nuclear weapons despite their inability to achieve a breakthrough in four days in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The president said he hopes for an arms control agreement by the end of his term in January to supplement the INF treaty that was formally ratified during his four days in <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>. But, he quickly added, `` I am dead set against deadlines.'' `` We can look with optimism on future negotiations,'' he said, even he continued to defend his proposal for <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION>, which has been a key stumbling block in superpower arms-control negotiations. `` The conversations are still going on and they are still being discussed and I say progress is still being made or we would n't be talking as we are,'' he said. But <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said `` I honestly ca n't answer that question'' when asked whether he thought he and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> would meet once more time as the leaders of the two superpowers It was <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s decision to soft-pedal differences on human rights that seemed likely to be his most memorable comments at a news conference televised live in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ particularly after his meeting two days earlier with dissidents who told him personally of their imprisonment and internment in labor camps during their struggle to emigrate. The leaders ended their fourth summit by exchanging the documents of ratification of the intermediate-range nuclear arms treaty -LRB- INF -RRB- signed last December. They said they will press to complete an elusive agreement to cut strategic nuclear weapons by up to 50 percent. `` The first lines have already been written into a book of the world without nuclear weapons,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. `` ... I do n't think anyone can close that book and put it aside. In his news conference _ the first such session ever held by a Soviet leader in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said the president's <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION> remained as one key obstacle to an offensive arms agreement, along with a dispute over limits on submarine launched cruise missiles. He said he told <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> that the view that the so-called Star Wars program is strictly a defensive one is `` just not serious.'' The issue snagged dramatic bargaining during the second sumit held in 1986 in <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>. In a brief ceremony in the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s St. <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> shook hands four separate times, giving no indication that differences on issues had soured the warm personal relationship they have displayed here. In his remarks to reporters, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> generally praised <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> although he said American economic and arms policies were often contradictory. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> summarized their meetings as `` big politics, politics that affect millions of millions of people.'' He said that with the INF treaty, `` the era of nuclear disarmament has begun.'' ` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, praising the INF treaty as historic because it mandates the elimination of an entire class of nuclear weapons, said, `` We must not stop here, Mr. general secretary. There is much more to be done.'' Despite the lack of major agreements, it was an upbeat windup to the fourth summit in 30 months between the two leaders and the first visit to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> by an American president in 14 years. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> made a point of noting that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had said he no longer viewed the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as an `` evil empire.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Tuesday he had been talking about `` another time, another era.'' The Soviet leader said, `` We take note of this,'' remarking that `` Everything flows, everything changes.'' In the absence in a strategic arms pact, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said `` we will not make any dramatic conclusions'' at this summit. However, he said, they were moving `` step by step'' toward an eventual treaty. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had made a point during his visit of mixing criticism with praise for the Soviet record on human rights and freedom. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said that when <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` tried to persuade me to change my mind,'' I said, your explanations are not convincing ... I am not filled with admiration at this aspect of the visit..'' In developing his theme, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said, `` But big politics means difficult politics,'' a reference perhaps to the strategic arms negotiations that remains snagged, and to the human rights issues that continue to divide the superpower nations. `` Big politics also means big responsibility,'' he continued. `` It can not be built on pursuing only one ` s own interest'' in the movements toward `` a nuclear free and non-violent world.'' `` President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and I have agreed that the immediate task before us,'' achievement of a reduction of 50 percent in strategic nuclear arsenals, `` can and must be accomplished,'' the Soviet leader said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> congratulated each other, and exchanged pens used to sign the INF documents, while an audience of high-ranking officials and dignitaries looked on. First ladies <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> sat next to one another on the front row. December's intermediate-range nuclear arms treaty requires the destruction of all nuclear missiles on each side with a range of 300 to 3,400 miles. It was the first superpower nuclear arms pact in 16 years. The far more expansive treaty that eluded <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> would have provided for cuts of 30 to 50 percent in the superpowers' stockpiles of strategic missiles, bombers and submarines. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., who present for the exchange of treaty documents, said it was unlikely the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would have a debate and ratification vote on a strategic missile treaty, even if <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> negotiated such a pact before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> leaves office `` My suggestion would be that we make haste slowly, that we not go too fast,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said at a joint news conference with <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. `` There are big problems ... a verification terrain that would be strewn with booby traps and mine-fields.''

 Here is a text of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s opening statement and news conference Wednesday at <ORGANIZATION> Spaso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>: If just this one time I might speak for all of you as well as myself, I would like to extend my thanks to General Secretary <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, all of his associates in the Soviet government and the people of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for all they've done to make our stay here a pleasant one and this summit conference the success it has been. This is my fourth summit. For some in our governments and some of you in the media, the number is higher. But a good deal of important work has been accomplished here in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The personal relationship between Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and me and the various members of our respective delegations has continued to deepen and improve. The personal relationships and hopes for peace are not by themselves enough. I think history will note that in our approach to the summit process the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has sought a consistency of expression as well as purpose. Out of every turn, I've tried to state our overwhelming desire for peace; I've also tried to note the existence of fundamental differences. And that's why it's a source of great satisfaction that those difference in part as a result of these meetings continue to recede. In addition, spokesmen for the Soviet government have noted the change of policy, indeed the profound change of policy, that has occurred in their own government. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is fully cognizant of this change and aware of its implications. In noting the differences that still stand between us, therefore, my desire has not been to sound a note of discouragement but one of realism. Not to conduct a tutorial but to give the kind of emphatic testimony to the truth that over the long run removes the illusion and moves the process of negotiation forward. From our standpoint, this approach has borne fruit at previous meetings and again at this summit conference. And here, permit me to go back for just a moment to our first summit meeting at <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. There, we agreed on certain fundamental realities that would govern our relations. That a nuclear war can not be won and must never be fought. That the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> bear special responsibilities for the risk of war. That neither side should seek military superiority over the other. We affirmed our determination to prevent war, whether nuclear or conventional. And our resolve to contribute in every way possible along with other nations to a safer world. We also set out a broad agenda and initiated a new process of dialogue to address the sources of tension in U.S.-Soviet relations. Since <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, we have achieved through a sustained effort progress across this broad agenda. Our first discussions here in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> focused on the important matter of human rights, individual freedoms. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> views human rights as fundamental to our relationship with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and all nations. From the beginning we stressed this point, and are encouraged by recent signs of progress in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. I believe where people have the right to speak, write, travel and worship freely, creative energies are released. On several occasions I've said that nations do not distrust each other because they're armed, they are armed because they distrust each other. For the past three years, General Secretary <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and I have worked to build a relationship of greater trust. And we both recognize that one way to do that is to improve understanding between our two countries through broader people-to-people contacts. A series of agreements to expand U.S.-Soviet bilateral cooperation, including cultural exchanges, have been concluded. We agreed to expand our student exchange programs with the goal of allowing hundreds and eventually thousands of Soviet and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> high school students to study in each other's classrooms. For our future relations, academic, cultural and other exchanges are of greater importance. Turning to regional issues, Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and I agreed that there must be peaceful solutions to these conflicts. Our goal is to advance independence, security and freedom. The Soviet decision to withdraw from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> is significant, and we agree that building on the Afghan settlement leads to an approach to other regional problems. Our discussions also dealt with <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Each of our summit meetings moved us farther toward an INF treaty, capped by today's exchange of ratification instruments which now makes it a reality. Each meeting has also moved us farther toward meeting the even greater challenge of crafting a treaty to reduce our strategic nuclear arsenals. In <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, the general secretary and I agreed on the concept of 50 percent reductions, and in <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION> on numerical limits for warheads and delivery vehicles; in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, on intensive work to complete a START treaty, including comprehensive verification provisions building upon those in INF. Here in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, we've made important additional strides toward that objective. Verification is one of the most important and most difficult issues for us, and I'm pleased to report progress in this area, too. We've moved forward in other areas as well, including agreements on an experiment to improve the verification of existing nuclear testing treaties and notification of strategic ballistic missile launches. Finally, let me say how deeply moving I have found my discussions with various citizens of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The monks of <PERSON> Danilov </PERSON>, the dissidents and refuseniks, the writers and artists, the students and young people have shown once again that spiritual values are cherished in this nation. It's my fervent hope that those values will attain even fuller expression.

<HEAD>MOSCOW: fuller expression.</HEAD>

 Q: Mr. President, I know you touched on this, but in your first news conference in 1981 you said that the Soviets lie and cheat to pursue their ends of world domination. What has really changed your mind? Can the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people really trust the Russians now? A: Well, <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> that was the first press conference that I had held since being elected president and the question that came to me was, could we believe the <LOCATION> Russians </LOCATION> or would they lie to us? And my answer at that time was not expressing my opinion. I said I will answer that with their own words and then I cited some of the leaders of the communist movement in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> that said that the only immorality was anything that slowed the growth of socialism, and that there was no immorality in lying or cheating or doing anything of that kind as long as it advanced the cause of socialism. Now that was my answer. So it was n't my opinion. I was quoting what their leaders themselves, the beginners of that particular system had said. Q. Do you still think that? A: I think right now of course, as I've said, ... trust but verify. But I think that there is quite a difference today in the leadership and in the relationship between our two countries. And we have held very productive meetings that I think were productive for both sides.'' Q: On the START treaty, what are the areas of progress and what was the specific progress that you achieved here, and why do you think that you can conclude the treaty this year when <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders are urging you to go slow, and this summit, with all its momentum, was n't able to break the impasse? A: Well, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders themselves brought the ratification papers here that we just received today on the INF treaty. It meant changing their own schedules a great deal and speeding up the ratification process. I think that we can count on them to feel the same if we are coming to final agreement on a START treaty. But I want to remind you of one thing that we've said over and over again: the START treaty is infinitely more complex than the INF treaty, and therefore there's going to be continued negotiation on a number of points. And then it will depend on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Once, if we have agreed upon a treaty, it is their responsibility to thoroughly study that treaty and then issue ratification of it if they find it satisfactory. We can hope, I would hope that before the year is out that we could eliminate the differences that still exist. But if not I would hope that my successor would continue, because here we are getting at I think the most important reduction that should take place in nuclear weapons. The most destabilizing are the intercontinental ballistic missiles in which someone pushes a button and minutes later a part of the earth blows up. And that's why, and the thing that I expressed my hope about, is that not only have we said 50 percent, but in that first meeting in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, the general secretary proposed the idea also of reducing by half our nuclear missiles Q: Could you go over the areas of progresss on START that you achieved here? A: No, I do n't think that I should go on. The conversations are still going on and there are things still being discussed. And as I say, progress has been made or we would n't still be talking the way we are. There's a young lady in the back that I think is native to the scene. Q: Mr. President, is there something in Soviet-American relations that you would advise your successor to leave behind? And is there something that you would specially advise to take to the future? A: Yes, if these negotiations and so forth are still going on, I will do everything I can to persuade my successor to follow up and to continue. And, as a matter of fact, I think I'll tell him that he will find the Russian people most warm, and hospitable and friendly.

 Remains dug up this week are those of the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Killer </LOCATION>'s 40th victim, but the commander of the search for the nation's worst known serial killer says it's unlikely the find will lead to a breakthrough in the six-year-old case. The bones and skull of <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> <PERSON> Estes </PERSON>, a runaway who long had been feared a victim of the killer, were identified Tuesday through dental records. In addition to the 40 women known dead, eight missing women are listed as probable victims of the killer, who frequently dumped bodies in clusters in woods east and south of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Estes </PERSON>, who was 15 when she vanished nearly six years ago, had been on the missing list until her remains were found Monday by workers digging post holes at a new apartment complex in Federal Way, a town between <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>, said King County Police Sgt. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. `` Like everything else that comes up, this answers one question and poses 100 more,'' said Capt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, commander of the <LOCATION> King </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Police </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> task force. He said it was unlikely the discovery would yield any breakthroughSoviet society. How do you feel about the fact that they have kept dossiers on these dissidents with whom you've met, and does n't that contradict your view that there have been improvements here, and that this is a more open society under Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>? A: Well, no, the figures themselves reveal that improvements have been made. Some 300 people have been freed from imprisonment, a number of people. The lists that we bring are names that have been brought to our attention by relatives or friends, their own relatives for example living in our country now. And I have brought those names to the general secretary and explained the personal interest that we have in them, and a great many of them have since been allowed to come to our country or to other countries that they preferred such as <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and so I think that there has been a sizeable improvement. And we still are going to continue doing that. Q: The very people with whom you met have now been investigated by Soviet authorities and might be subject to some form of retaliation. Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said today that you no longer feel that this is the evil empire, that you told him that within the Kremlin walls. Does n't this contradict your new feeling of optimism about the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>? A: No, because as I say he has received the latest list that I brought here. And previous experiences with this, a great many of those people have people have been allowed to come to our country. Q: Yesterday you did say you no longer believe the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is an evil empire. You said that was another time, another era. What's changed? Is it just Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s succession to the general secretaryship, or have you yourself changed or expanded your view of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>? A: No, I think that a great deal of it is due to the general secretary who I have found different than previous Soviet leaders have been, but that also as we have pursued this we have found them willing to enter into negotiations with us. And I think that enough progress has been made that we can look with optimism on future negotiations. Q: Is there anything that you have learned, that you personally have expanded or changed your views because you've had an opportunity to learn more about this country and about their system ... or is it just <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>? A: Well, a large part of it is Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as a leader and I think there have been changes here as they have sought to make _ well, I read ` Perestroika' and I found much in it that I could agree with. Q: Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said that he thought you could have achieved more in this summit. Specifically, he went on to say that on the issue of the ABM interpretation and treaty he said that you had gone back on your word, that in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> you had agreed that you would no longer seek military superiority and that by holding to the development of SDI you were seeking superiority in outer space and that therefore you had gone back on your word. Are you seeking superiority in outer space? Can you reach a START agreement without some accomodation on SDI and the START question? A: SDI in my mind _ maybe some of my people would n't agree with me _ but the whole thing was my idea, to see if there could not be developed a defensive weapon that would make it virtually impossible for nuclear missiles to get through to their targets in another country. And from the very beginning, I have said that if and when such a system can be developed I would support the idea of making it available worldwide, because since we all know how to make nuclear missiles, sometime there could be a madman come along, as a <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> came along, who could then make those missiles. But that my idea would be the sharing of the knowledge of SDI as a defensive weapon would be accompanied by the total elimination of nuclear weapons. And I happen to believe that this will be a lot better world if we get rid of all the nuclear weapons. And that is what my dream of SDI is, that it can be the tool by which we eliminate those weapons. Q: <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said today that he did not believe it's for defensive purposes. ... You failed to convince him despite the fact that you're on such good terms with him. A: I know he has said that before. Well, maybe he just does n't know me well enough But from the very first I have said that that is my goal for that defensive weapon. There is nothing offensive about it. It can not hurt or kill anyone. It can just make it impossible for missiles to get through the screen.

 Q: About this effort you again stated today to try to get a START treaty before you leave office. You have less than eight months left in office. <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> could have 10 years. By setting up any kind of deadline, no matter how unofficial, are n't you putting all the pressure on the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> side?'' A: Oh, no, no. We set no deadline. I said we are going to continue working toward that. And I could hope that maybe in that period of time, but no, I am dead set against deadlines. You do n't make a treaty just to simply have it be achieved at a certain point in time The treaty is ready when it is a good treaty and good for all sides involved. And that's what we'll do instead of setting a deadline and then saying, `` Well, let's sign it because we've reached the deadline. It has to be good. Q: To prevent U.S.-Soviet relations from being mixed up in politics, are you willing to rule out a summit until the presidential campaign is over in November? A: I'd make any decision of that kind based on how I thought it could affect the situation. If it gave a promise of success, then go for it. Q: Why do you favor repeal on two-term limit on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidents when <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is promoting the idea of limited terms for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>? A: I would hesitate to comment on that. This system of government here, you do not have a national election in which all of the people vote to see who would be the leader. My objection to the constitutional amendment that was passed in our country limiting a president to two terms was the fact that that is the only office in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in which all the people vote for the candidates for that office. And it seems to me that it is an infringement on the rights of our people in a democracy to tell them that they ca n't vote for someone because of a time limit. I think it impinges on their right to vote for whoever they want to vote for for as many times as they want to vote for them. That is the principle of democracy. Q: You talked a lot about how it is a positive thing for students from both countries to mix and mingle. ... Do you think part of your positive feeling about the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> these days comes as a result of greater tolerance you've developed as a result of your meetings with Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>?'' A: Well, I have found that Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and I, I think, have a very satisfactory relationship. But at the same time I am never going to relax my belief in the need for verification of agreements that we might make. I'm quite sure that he feels the same way. Q: In your first meeting with Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> he suggested the reduction of half-a-million military personnel ... but there was no follow-up. A: No, this proposal, this was ... just a suggestion made of the removal of a half-a-million men on the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> line on the European front. This has to be considered _ we think that we are coming to a point, and that he himself is willing to, of reductions in conventional weapons along that front, and conventional forces as well as the nuclear forces. But the simple removing of a half-a-million men would not be exactly equal, because his military would be moved a short distance back away from the front. Well, there's a 3,000-mile ocean between where our men would have to be moved. And in the event of an emergency we'd have an ocean to cross to get our men back there and equal. So that has to be considered. Q: Regarding your comments on human rights, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said he `` I did not have a lot of admiration for that part of the trip.'' ... Did he say anything to you specifically about the meeting with dissidents or your remarks at <LOCATION> Danilov </LOCATION> monastery or the remarks yesterday at the writers' union? A: No, but I do know that he and others have had a feeling that in some way our concern with this is interfering in your internal government policies. I have explained to him, and I think maybe he has seen the point, our country's very unique. All of us, either by ourselves or through our ancestors or our grandparents or parents, came from someplace else. We're about the only nation in the world that can say that. As a matter of fact, the estimate is that one out of eight Americans trace their parentage and their heritage, if not their own emigration, to the Eastern bloc. I have put it this way that you do n't stop loving your mother because you've taken unto yourself a wife. So the people in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> do have a feeling for the countries of their heritage. In my case it was a great-grandfather on one side and a grandmother and grandfather on my mother's side. Well, Americans retain that feeling of friendship and loyalty to the countries that, as I say, were, are their heritage. And so when we feel that people are being unjustly treated, imprisoned for something that in our country would not be a crime calling for such a sentence, our people get aroused, and they come to us and they want help, they want something done. A wife who's been waiting for eight years for her husband to be allowed to leave this country to join her, things of this kind we do n't think are really interfering with someone else's business. We think it's very much our business to bring it to the attention where we feel that there's an injustice to the government. And I have explained this to the general secretary and I think mhe has seen the justice of what I've said because many of the individuals that we've brought to his attention have now been released from confinement here and have been allowed to emigrate, come to other countries, to our country.

<HEAD>Program In Works To Exercise Sea Turtles To Protect Them From

<TEXT>
 An exercise program in the works for endangered sea turtles wo n't have them racing hares but may help them dodge sharks, scientists say. Scientists at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> are developing a regimen for the more than 1,000 <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Ridley </PERSON> turtles raised in captivity each year and released into the Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in an effort to save them from extinction. In captivity, the turtles are too aggressive to be placed together in a tank and have to live in one-gallon plastic milk cartons or other small containers in larger tanks, said <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON>, manager of the federally funded program to save the turtles. The turtles get virtually no exercise, <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON> said. About the most they can do is flap inside their containers. As a result, they may not be as expert as they could be at dodging predators once they are released into the Gulf, <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON> said. Scientists fear that the more than 13,500 Ridleys already released into the Gulf have been too vulnerable to their No. 1 enemy _ the shark. <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON>, working with <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Caillouet </PERSON>, chief of the life studies division for the fisheries service, has developed an exercise system that involves pumping water through the tanks to create a current the turtles can swim against. The flow would be continuous during daylight hours, except during feeding periods, <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON> said. There would be no current at night. The program is being tested with 120 hatchlings that will be nine to 11 months old at the end of the experiment. Sixty turtles will be tested in the exercise environment and 60 will be in regular tanks. The turtles' stress hormone levels will be checked periodically, <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON> said. `` If we find that it is causing too much stress, then we'll have to try some other approaches,'' he said.

 Q. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said he proposed a draft statement using the words `` peaceful coexistence'' and your first response was `` I like it,'' but after meeting with aides you changed your mind. Why? A. Well, I liked the whole tone, the general tone of it, and what it was seeking to achieve was what we were both seeking to achieve. But I said at the same time I would take it to our people, and I took it there and they studied it and saw where there could have been certain ambiguities in there that would not achieve the general thought of what was bring proposed. We were in agreement with the general thought. So some rewriting was done by our own people. And when the total statement is released to you I think you will find that we have achieved what it was he had with the paragraph that he proposed, and it has been achieved and improved to the point that it is clear and unmistakable, that it achieves the purpose that he had in mind. Q. What's the substitute, the better term your aides have advised you to use? A. No, peaceful coexistence, both pieces achieved the same end, but the other one had ambiguities in it _ and I do n't think it was intentional _ but they could have been used to justify doing something else that was not in keeping with the entire goal of the statement here. Q. Do you believe that essentially it is just bureaucratic lethargy that has caused emigration problems in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>? A. I'm afraid that I have to confess to you that I think one of the sins of government, and one with which we must deal and never have been able to be completely successful with, and this includes our own government, is that the bureaucracy once created has one fundamental rule above all others: preserve the bureaucracy. And I think that governments will always ... find that they are having to check on bureaucracy and make sure that it is not abiding by its own rules and taking the easiest course. And so, I would n't picking -LRB- sic -RRB- on one government other than another. Q. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said he did not find your arguments on human rights in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> convincing. A. I think that there is a mistaken view, and oh, how I yearn to have him come to our country for long enough to see some of our country, I think there's a mistaken view about the things that occasionally dominate the press, about prejudice, racial or religious, in our country, about people, the so-called street people that apparently have no place to live. And I think these problems, these are socio-economic problems in our land, we have them, of course. We also try to deal with them. But I do n't think he quite could understand a recent situation: a young lady living on the sidewalks of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, living out there on the sidewalk, winter and summer, and so for her own sake, the police picked her up to bring her to where she could be placed in a shelter and she took her case to court and won her case in court that she should be allowed to go back and sleep on the sidewalk where she had been because that's what she preferred to do. Well, when you have a free country, how far can we go in impinging on the freedom of someone who says this is the way I want to live? I think we could straighten him out if he saw what we did in our country. Q. In this room on Monday you heard moving stories of people who had been in prison, dissidents, religious people, and then you went to <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and then you wrote it off to bureacuracy. Is that really your view that it is only the bureaucracy, it is not a willful policy of the government here to keep these people from emigrating? A. No, I ca n't say that it is when I do n't know that much about the system, but the question was presented to me on the basis that it possibly was a bureaucratic bungle. Maybe I should illustrate to you why I feel the way I do about bureaucracies. Once during the war I happened to be involved in a situation in which one level of the military wanted a warehouse full of filing cabinets, wanted permission to destroy the files so they could use those filing cases and they were able to prove that the documents had no historic value, they had no bearing on present day government at all; they were just useless. And so the message went up through the ranks requesting permission to destroy these obsolete files. And then back down through the ranks from the top command, endorsed by each level of command, came the reply: `` Permission granted _ provided copies were made of each file destroyed.'' Q. Do n't you think you're letting Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> off a little easy on just saying it's bureaucracy? A. No, as I said, I do n't _ the way the question was framed, I thought there was a possibility of that. No, but I just have to believe that in any government, some of us do find ourselves bound in by bureaucracy, and then sometimes you have to stomp your foot and say unmistakably I want it done. And then maybe you get through with it. But I have great confidence in his ability to do that. Q. You said if there was progress toward a START treaty you would be willing to come together a fifth time. ... Have you made enough progress that you now think a START treaty is likely within your term? A. I honestly can not answer that. I do n't know. Let me just give you what the mechanics are. Our people have been steadily in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, both sides, Soviet people and our people, both sides working on this treaty, knowing what we hope to achieve, and they're working there, and as I say, they've made progress. There is no way to judge and there is no way that I would give them a date and say, `` Please, you have to get this by such and such a time,'' because that's not the way to get a good treaty. I want a good treaty. Q. Is the only condition under which you would have a fifth summit with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> if there was a good START treaty ready to be signed. A. Well, you ca n't rule out, something else might come up that necessitates our getting together and settling something other than that particular treaty. So no one can say, no, there will be no need for a summit. Q. What have you learned in your first trip to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>? A. I'm going to do one answer because I've wanted to say this and I say it every time I get a chance: I think that one of the most wonderful forces for stability and good that I have seen in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> are the <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> women.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> muted his long-standing criticism of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> leadership today and said emigration barriers may arise from a Kremlin `` bound in by bureaucracy'' rather than willful Soviet policy. At a summit windup news conference, the president avoided any direct criticism of his host, Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, and said <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> officials believe that raising questions about emigration constituted `` interfering'' in internal matters. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also held out hope that an agreement on sharp slashes in the superpowers' nuclear arsenals still could be achieved before he leaves office but said he he was dead set against deadlines. But his comments on arms control were overshadowed by his suggestion that Soviet leaders should not be personally blamed for the restrictions which put Soviet citizens in labor camps and keep thousands of Jews and other Russians from leaving. `` I just have to believe that in any government some of us do find ourselves bound in by bureaucracy,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. He said in such instances a leader must stomp his feet and demand that wrongs be set right and he suggested he thought <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was doing that. `` I have great confidence in his ability to do that,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, noting that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has been responsive when <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> gave him lists of hardship cases. The president was asked by an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> reporter whether he felt he was `` letting Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> off a little easy on just saying it's bureaucracy'' that bars Russians from leaving. The question grew out of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s reply to a student at <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday about dissidents and refuseniks, those who have been denied visas and often lose their jobs or are otherwise punished merely for seeking permission to leave. `` I'm not blaming you; I'm blaming bureaucracy,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told the student. `` We have the same type of thing happen in our country ...'' On other issues, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>: _ Expressed optimism that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> could come to terms on a treaty to reduce their arsenals of strategic nuclear weapons by 30 percent to 50 percent `` The conversation are still going on and they are still being discussed and I say progress is still being made or we would n't be talking as we are,'' he said. _ Refused to commit himself to a fifth summit with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, but did not rule out the possibility of one, even without a START agreement to sign _ Said he and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> have a `` very satisfactory relationship but at the same time I am never going to relax my belief in the need for verification of agreements that we might make. _ Maintained that his disavowal of his earlier characterization of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as an `` evil empire'' results from changes instituted by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> `` I read Perestroika and I found much in it that I agreed with,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` Perestroika,'' meaning restructuring, is the title of a book by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. But it was his remark about Soviet bureaucracy that raised the most pointed question. `` In this room on Monday,'' the reporter said, `` you heard moving stories of people who had been in prison, dissidents, religious people, and then you went to <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and then you wrote it off to bureacuracy. Is that really your view that it is only the bureaucracy, it is not a willful policy of the government here to keep these people from emigrating?'' In response, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the the question had been `` presented to me on the basis that it possibly was a bureaucratic bungle.'' Actually, the student's question had been why had <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> invited only refuseniks and dissidents to meet with him the previous day. Throughout the summit, the president has soft-pedaled his customary attacks of the communist system. He was reminded that at his first news conference in the White House in 1981 he said that <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leaders are willing to lie and cheat in pursuit of world domination. Asked if that was still his view, he said in 1981 he had merely been quoting what <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leaders themselves had said. Using the Russian words, he said with a smile, that his policy remains: `` trust, but verify.'' He said he has found <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> `` different than previous Soviet leaders'' and that `` we can look with optimism to future negotiations'' to reduce strategic arms. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> met with reporters shortly after <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, at the first news conference he had ever held in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, noted with pleasure that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had retracted his characterization of this country as an `` evil empire.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and other Soviet leaders `` have had a feeling that in some way'' American concern with human rights conditions in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> constitute `` interfering in your interal government policies.'' Asked about prospects from agreement on START in his term, he said, `` I honestly can not answer that, I do n't know.'' He said negotiators are continuing working in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on the difficult issues involved, but `` There is no way that I would give them a date -LRB- for completion -RRB- ... because that is not the wqay to get a good treaty.''

 Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said today that ousted <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Communist Party chief <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> will be asked to account for an interview with Western news organizations in which he criticized a member of the ruling Politburo. In an unprecedented public airing of high-level <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> disputes, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also denied reports of a rift between himself and <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, 67, the party's theoretician and No. 2 figure in the Politburo. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> answered reporters' questions at a news conference, broadcast live from the Soviet Foreign Ministry, at the close of his summit talks with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. It was the first time that a Soviet leader had held a news conference in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in interviews broadcast Monday that <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> was blocking reforms and should resign. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION> today that he had been misquoted in the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> interview. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s `` position is at variance with that of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>,'' to which <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> still belongs. `` We at the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> will demand from Comrade <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> explanations as to what it is all about and what he is after,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, 57, was ousted as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party boss in November and from the Politburo in February after he made an angry speech before the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which has more than 300 members and meets several times a year to vote on party policy. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> denied <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s charge that <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> was blocking reform, and sought to quell rumors of friction between himself and <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, who is widely believed to be leading a conservative faction on the ruling Politburo. `` As for <PERSON> Comrade </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> and his resignation, no such problem exists, either in the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> or in the Polituro. That is all. That is what you should proceed from and that is the way it will be,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said emphatically. In his interviews broadcast Monday, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> should step down `` because processes in the party are too slow, because the party is still lagging behind, because the process of democratization is not developing ... and <PERSON> Comrade </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> is the main person responsible.'' In an interview taped Tuesday and broadcast today on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America'' show, about the time that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was answering reporters' questions, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> said the transcript of his <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> interview was `` an outright fabrication. He said there was `` absolutely no talk of resignation whatsoever.'' And he denied telling the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> interviewer that he was upset with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` Also apart from politically being, well, outright fabrication, I would say this is not the first time they've let me down from purely a human standpoint,'' <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> today offered some details of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting at which <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> gave the speech which led to his ouster. `` Just as you are asking me questions, the statement he made at that meeting had not been planned. We had an exchange, a free-for-all,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. The Soviet leader said that besides <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, 27 committee members spoke. `` The opinion of all 27 speakers was that the generalizations made by <PERSON> Comrade </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> regarding the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, its secretariat and the Politburo were wrong, and his statement was recognized as being politically erroneous,'' he said. Soviet officials have refused to release the text of <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> ` s speech, citing <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> tradition and rules. In his earlier interviews, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> denied the authenticity of versions of the speech that circulated in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, but confirmed he had urged that the reforms be accelerated. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said he had not read the <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> interviews. `` I have asked for the exact wording of what Comrade <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> has said,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told reporters. In the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> interview broadcast today, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> said those who are opposing and trying to slow down <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of perestroika, or economic restructuring, are unorganized. `` Since each of them is going it alone, then of course it's just a group of people which, no matter how you try to estimate its numbers, is not organized,'' he said. `` That is, it's not the kind of organized opposition who has its own program, or is an organized kind of opposition to perestroika or its thesis or anything like that,'' <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> said. Even if <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms fail, `` the chances are very good'' that he will remain in power, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> said. `` There are great difficulties in perestroika,'' he said. `` Perestroika also has a moral side. People's spirit, their culture, the renewal of society, the revolutionary overhaul of society _ are these really things that can happen in one, two or even three years?'' Said <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>: `` It wo n't be our generation which will complete perestroika, that's my opinion.'' <PERSON> Feodor </PERSON> <PERSON> Burlatsky </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member and now a commentator for the weekly <ORGANIZATION> Literaturnaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters Tuesday that if <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> were a true foe of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s economic and social reforms, he would face severe punishment. `` If <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> has his own views, it is only natural. It is another thing to lead some conservatives, and I think this is not a fact,'' <PERSON> Burlatsky </PERSON> said. `` If such a person appears on the political scene, he would be out of the leadership.'' <PERSON> Alexei </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbatov </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economy </ORGANIZATION> and International Relations, said in an interview he did not agree with <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> that <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> is blocking reform. <PERSON> Arbatov </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Georgy </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member and head of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Study </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, told reporters that `` in our point of view, I do n't think it was too correct'' of <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> to use the Western news media to mount his attack.

<HEAD>Fish, Seal Deaths Blamed On Waste Polluting North Sea Waters</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A government minister today called for international action to reduce pollution in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> after thousands of fish and hundreds of seals were reported dead along their shores. Environment Minister <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Toepfer </PERSON> told a special <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> committee meeting that action to reduce the dumping of wastes was needed because of `` strong suspicions'' it threatened sea life. During the meeting, the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> demanded the government immediately ban ships from getting rid of chemical and other wastes at sea. About 50 dead seals have been found on West German shorelines in the past month, while about 300 have been discovered along <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s coasts, <PERSON> Toepfer </PERSON> said. He said biologists checking the dead seals discovered they were suffering from a virus that caused their deaths. Experts last weekend said pneumonia was the `` final cause'' of death. Thousands of tons of fish meanwhile died from a blanket of yellow sea algae in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Toepfer </PERSON> said. The algae, up to 10 feet thick in some places, spread from the coasts of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and now threatens <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, Danish officials said. West German reports have said the fish were dying from slime from the algae, which coated their gills and prevented them from breathing. Experts blamed nitrates from agricultural fertilizers and phosphorus from sewage and industrial pollution for the dramatic growth of the algae. In <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, fish farmers were advised to kill their fish. Resort owners in western <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> fear news of the algae may ruin the summer tourist season.

<HEAD>St. Louis Hospital First To Have Remote Heart Attack Treatment
Device</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LORI DODGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A hospital here is testing a new briefcase-size device that allows doctors to save some heart attack victims no matter where they are by activating a life-saving jolt of electricity via a telephone hookup. Jewish Hospital will use the portable MDphone transtelephonic defibrillator on a trial basis for nine months to a year, hospital officials said Tuesday. The electronic device could free certain patients from long hospital stays, said Dr. <PERSON> Rodolphe </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruffy </PERSON>, director of arrhythmia services at the hospital. The MDphone allows heart patients to stay at home while retaining immediate access to the treatment base station at the hospital, he said. When a patient or another person opens the unit, which can be plugged into a standard phone jack, the hospital base station's phone number is automatically dialed and medical personnel can give directions over the phone Upon application of adhesive electrode pads to the patient's chest, doctors at the hospital can monitor the patient's electrocardiogram on a computer screen at the base The patient's history can also be called up. The doctor then can, if necessary, activate the defibrillator to try to restore a normal heart beat by administering an electric shock, <PERSON> Ruffy </PERSON> said. `` The MDphone is the first interactive medical system capable of treating life-threatening arrhythmias -LRB- irregular heartbeat -RRB- by telephone,'' said <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> MEDphone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Paramus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, which developed the device. `` If treatment is not administered within four to six minutes after the onset of fibrillation, brain damage is likely to occur,'' he said. `` Our tests have proven that the MDphone makes it possible for patients to be diagnosed and defibrillated at the scene of the emergency within two minutes of the onset of symptoms, considerably faster than ambulance response time.'' <PERSON> Ruffy </PERSON> said the agreement with <ORGANIZATION> MEDphone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> calls for a fully operational 24-hour emergency response system at <LOCATION> Jewish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> within about a month. He said the hospital would then begin to recruit candidates for the service. <PERSON> Ruffy </PERSON> said that eventually a network of hospitals would have the system and that any of them could treat a patient. MDphone already has been tested on about 100 patients at various hospitals and has been approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Ruffy </PERSON> said.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> today announced an international conference to help establish a global system to verify nuclear weapons tests. In his speech to the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>'s special session on disarmament, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the only nation that has had atomic weapons used against it, would co-sponsor the conference with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. The meeting in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> would aim to exchange seismological information used to detect nuclear tests, he said. `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> experienced unspeakable horrors as a result of the atomic bombs that were dropped on the cities of <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION>,'' he told delegates. `` The Japanese people solemnly pray that nuclear weapons will ultimately be eliminated so that a nuclear holocaust can never be repeated.'' <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> did not disclose the date of the planned conference in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>.

 On Tuesday, Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> can help the world disarm by monitoring and verifying arms control agreements between the superpowers and other countries. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> leader said that the international body could make a `` significant contribution'' to disarmament pacts `` in ways agreeable to the parties concerned.'' Speaking at the opening of the special session, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> military observers and peacekeepers could help monitor and verify arms agreements. He said world military spending totals about $ 1 trillion a year, while the annual <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> budget is only about $ 721 million _ and about $ 700 million is outstanding in unpaid contributions by member states. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> owes more than $ 200 million _ withheld because of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fiscal constraints and disagreements with <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> policies. The four-week disarmament session moved into high gear today. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> was among about 25 heads of state and government slated to address the 159-member body during the session. Many members, such as <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and its Arab neighbors, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> are feuding or engaged in regional arms races. Speakers will include <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> today and, in the course of debate, Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> and others. The current assembly is the third special session on disarmament in 10 years and diplomats say numerous issues separate the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its allies from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, socialist countries and the developing world. No breakthroughs are expected and many diplomats are seeking to avoid confrontation and unproductive criticism of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Differences between the superpowers include priorities for nuclear and conventional disarmament, the urgency of a swift, total and comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' insistence on developing a space-based missile defense system, the issue of diverting military spending to development and other issues <PERSON> Lynne </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, the assistant director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disarmament </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will continue testing nuclear weapons because `` the concept of deterrence undergirds our security.'' Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON> condemned the ongoing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tests and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s concept of nuclear deterrence `` not only because of -LRB- its lack of -RRB- practical usefulness but because of the immoral nature of this kind of deterrence.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> says there's no doubt one of its aircraft was endangered by a small plane flying in restricted airspace, but a federal official says he has only the co-pilot's word as evidence. According to the airline, the close call occurred Monday at about 7,000 feet and five miles southeast of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hopkins </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, the destination of Flight 283 from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. The DC-9 was carrying 79 people. The co-pilot told <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> officials he had finished making some notes, looked up and saw a small aircraft `` coming right at us,'' said airline spokesman <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON>. The pilot swerved to avoid the plane. A flight attendant hurled to the floor suffered bruises. <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> said the co-pilot, whom he refused to identify, described the small plane as a Piper Aztec or Seminole. `` The first officer -LRB- co-pilot -RRB-, the captain, vice president of flight operations and president -LRB- of <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- are all dumbfounded that there is apparently a question as to the details of the incident,'' <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> said Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> are investigating the airline's report, but an <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> official said, `` We ca n't even confirm there were two planes.'' <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ragle </PERSON>, air traffic control manager for the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` There is no tangible evidence there was another plane, other than what the -LRB- co-pilot -RRB- said. The only thing we really have is that a <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> co-pilot said there was a plane.'' <PERSON> Ragle </PERSON> said that four air traffic controllers were unable to spot the second plane on radar after the report. He said radar was effective at that altitude and that `` it is not really explainable that we do n't see the target -LRB- the second plane -RRB-.'' `` If there was another airplane, it would have been in violation of several federal aviation regulations,'' he said. A <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, said small planes could be missed by radar if they are not using transponders, which give radar observers specific information.

 Republican <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON>, a lawyer who lost his only other bid for elective office 24 years ago, today officially opened his campaign to unseat Democratic <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>. <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON>, 55, emerged only after several prominent Republicans, including <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauder </PERSON>, former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, refused to challenge the popular two-term senator. `` I have been blessed with a wonderful and loving family; I live in a beautiful home, and I have been successful in business,'' <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON> said in a statement. `` Now it is time to pay back the American system that has been so good to me.'' <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON> conceded that he faces an `` uphill battle'' against <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, but said he has `` one thing in my favor, the issues.'' `` For too long, the Democratic senator from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> has chosen to ignore the problems that confront the average family in this state,'' he said. <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON> pledged to make acid rain, day care for working families, garbage disposal and an anti-drug campaign among his top domestic policy interests. In foreign affairs, <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON> said that he would stand behind <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should battle communism by improving the economies of developing nations. <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON> is an attorney in a <LOCATION> Garden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, firm. His only previous attempt at elective office came in 1964, when he was easily defeated in a special election for a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Council </LOCATION> seat. <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON> will be trying to overcome statewide obscurity much in the same way fellow Republican <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> did when the former <LOCATION> Hempstead </LOCATION> town supervisor captured <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s other senatorial seat in 1980. <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>'s victory was among the few bright spots in more than a decade of often lopsided defeats for Republicans seeking statewide office in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by about 1 million. Many times, Republicans have had trouble just finding candidates.

<HEAD>U.S. General Says Iran Building New Silkworm Site</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ABOARD THE USS CORONADO IN THE PERSIAN GULF (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is about to complete a major new Silkworm missile complex in the <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>, the top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military commander for the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> said today. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, despite recent losses in a sea battle with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, is `` not out of the game,'' said Gen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crist </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, which has administrative responsibility for the region. The Iranians have been `` very circumspect and careful,'' <PERSON> Crist </PERSON> said, `` but I do n't get any feeling that the Iranians have run up a white flag or that sort of thing ... I would not say they have given up their thoughts about trying to get to us.'' <PERSON> Crist </PERSON> said a major Silkworm missile complex was under construction at <LOCATION> Kuhestak </LOCATION>, overlooking the central part of the <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>, the gateway to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. Silkworms fired from there with a range of 50-60 miles would `` cover the entire strait,'' he said. The four-star Marine general spoke to members of a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> news media pool aboard the <PERSON> Coronado </PERSON>, the navy's flagship in the gulf. He said the super-sophisticated `` Aegis'' missile cruiser <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>, which arrived in the gulf during last week, was deployed partly because of the new Silkworm facility. The 9,400-ton ship's long-range air surveillance and weapons systems represents `` a quantum leap forward in our ability to handle that threat,'' <PERSON> Crist </PERSON> said. The Kuhestak missile site is a fixed installation as opposed to the mobile launcher used by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in the past. It could be operational by late summer, he said. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was suspected of having mobile Silkworm sites in the <LOCATION> Faw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> in the northern gulf and the Strait of <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Crist </PERSON>'s comments indicated more missiles could be positioned at the new site The Silkworm is a Chinese version of the 30-year-old Soviet Styx missile. Subsonic and crude by modern standards, it nevertheless can be devastating to ships. On April 18, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces destroyed two Iranian offshore platforms, sank a patrol boat and crippled two frigates in a series of gulf battles.

<HEAD>MOSCOW: a treaty. ...</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 I feel that we have now approached a situation where we should note that here too, insofar as the hot trouble spots -LRB- on the -RRB- planet are concerned, real possibilities have appeared for solving these regional problems, for untying _ unraveling these knots _ these tight knots on the basis of political approaches, on the basis of a balance of interests. In substance, we have noted today that first there is <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, then secondly there is the processes concerning the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. There is some joining closer together of positions and a maturing of understanding that there is a need to resolve the problem on the basis of an international conference. ... Then there is the problem of <LOCATION> Campuchia </LOCATION>, thanks to the initiatives taken by <PERSON> Viet </PERSON> <PERSON> Nam </PERSON> and Campuchia of late. That problem too is now becoming one which can be _ which does lend itself to solutions very soon. There are processes under way in <LOCATION> Latin-Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, solutions are possible. ... I have always emphasized and I emphasize this in my conversations with the president, as with all other Americans, we should not _ we must not lose our chance. And in this connection, I said outright to the president that the signing of the agreement on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> is a precedent which goes far beyond the limits of that problem alone, because it is the first case, first example, where the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, together with those directly involved in the conflict, signed an agreement which opens up an avenue for a political solution of that problem. ... In questions concerning human rights, humanitarian issues, there has been some progress in this sense. I posed the question in my talks with the president. I said there are facts relating to this sphere, individual cases, which do appear. We've always been giving attentive consideration to them, and we shall continue to do so. ... The more I think over this situation, the more I come to the conclusion that I can see that the American administration does not have a real understanding of the real situation insofar as human rights are concerned. They just do n't know about the processes in the sphere of democracy and democratization in this country. ... So I suggested to the president, let's organize, within the framework of inter-parliamentary exchange, a permanent seminar which would gather together members of our parliaments, representatives of political circles, public circles, and they should then exchange information and assessments. ... The president _ somebody asked the president whether he still considered the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to be an `` evil empire.'' He said no, and he said that within the walls of the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, next to the czar's gun, right in the heart of that `` evil empire.'' We take note of that. As the ancient Greeks say, everything flows, everything changes. Everything is in a state of flux. ... Today, when we were able to see that you can not resolve any of the world's problems through military means _ where we came more and more to the conclusion that they have to be resolved politically, by political means on the basis of a balance of interest, on the basis of respect for the social choice. And whether we want to or not, we must all learn to live in peace in this real world of ours. ... And proceeding ... from the fact that there is an understanding _ in fact, that there are lessons which we have drawn from the events in the past years, we suggested, let us then make a statement to that effect _ a joint statement to that effect. Here is the draft that I suggested to the president: `` Both of us proceeding from an awareness of the obtaining realities in the present day world believe that no problems in dispute are insoluble and that they should not be resolved by military means, that peaceful co-existence is something that we resolve as a universal principle of international relations, and that the equality of all states, non-interference in domestic affairs, and freedom of socio-political choice should be recognized as inalienable and mandatory for all.'' I gave the president both the Russian and English text. He read it and he said, `` I like it.'' But when today we met in order to finalize the text of the joint statement it turned out that not everybody likes it among those who surround the president, that kind of a statement. And that's what we were debating this morning. ... We were not able either to agree on the subject of talks on conventional arms in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. ... Now I'm thinking, there's so much talk that we should not move forward to 50 percent cuts in strategic arms unless we address ourselves to reductions in conventional arms and armaments in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. But as soon as we try to suggest some _ make some real proposals, in order to get that process under way, we immediately come up against some kind of incomprehensible maneuvers and attempts to deviate from that _ from the issue. When everybody voiced concern over the fact that the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> supposedly has a preponderance, we said, `` OK, let's exchange data, let's exchange data.'' The other side immediately tried to dodge the issue. ... The Americans did not accept our bold plan, three-phase plan for eliminating asymmetry and disbalances in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> aimed at building a structure of non-offensive arms and armed forces, with a considerably lower level of arms. We feel that we've missed a good chance to impart some good dynamics, both to relations between the two most powerful military groups, and thereby to promote international security as a whole. ...

 With <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> looking on, a Republican member of a bipartisan deficit-reduction commission said today the panel would not be swayed from doing its job by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s declaration that he would oppose any tax increase Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Frenzel </PERSON>, R-Minn., said he thought such comments were premature <PERSON> Frenzel </PERSON>, who is here at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s vacation retreat for the second of two days of talks on economic issues, told reporters, `` We are not going to get involved in any presidential campaigns.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the all-but-certain Republican presidential nominee, said Tuesday that he would ignore what he said was a likely recommendation from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> for a tax increase to reduce the budget deficit. During a picture-taking session today on the porch of the vice president's seaside home, <PERSON> Frenzel </PERSON> was asked if he felt <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s remarks would inhibit his own work on the commission `` I took an oath to work on the commission and to do it well,'' <PERSON> Frenzel </PERSON> said. At that point, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> interrupted, saying, `` I hope the commission will listen a little bit to the American people in this election. I think that's what an election is all about. The commission can take an objective look at -LRB- taxes -RRB- and do whatever it wants. But I'd be more persuaded by what Americans say.'' Former deputy <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, one of a half-dozen private economists here for the talks, said taxes were `` off the table and nobody has raised it yet.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked to comment on Democratic charges that his call for closing the budget deficit with a modified freeze on spending and with no new taxes was not realistic. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` It is not surprising the Democrats would say that. All they want to do is spend and tax. There is no change I can see or hear out on the campaign that would lead you to believe anything other than that on the Democratic side.'' One day earlier, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who touts himself as a would-be `` education president,'' said local taxes may have to go up if his call for better schools is heeded. `` They may have to,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` Ninety-three percent of the money for education comes from sources other than the federal government. If it's taxes, that's where it has to be.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s comments came as he repeated his oft-stated opposition to a federal tax increase. `` I've pledged no tax increase and I'm going to stay with it, period,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. The vice president, speaking after meeting with a group of private economists, also cautioned the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> against clamping down too tightly on credit in the name of fighting inflation. `` I'm not hypercritical of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>, but I do n't want to see action taken that's going to shut down economic growth in this country,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. The deficit-reduction panel, formed earlier this year, plans to submit its recommendations to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Dec. 21. In addition to members appointed by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and by both parties in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the panel will have two members named by whoever wins the election in November. `` It seems to me that the commission might well come up with a tax increase. And I'll be saying, ` Wait a minute. I've taken my case to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people to hold the line on taxes.''' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has proposed eliminating the budget deficit with what he calls a `` flexible freeze'' on spending. All programs, except Social Security benefits, would be held at 1989 levels plus inflation. Increases in one area would have to be offset by decreases in another. The vice president holds a second day of talks today with the same group of economic advisers. Among them is <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldstein </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> economist who quit his job as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s chief economist in 1985 when his advocacy of a tax increase to reduce the budget deficit ran afoul of the administration's stance against general tax increases. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that during his meeting Tuesday with the economic advisers, `` there was an expression of hoping that <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> policy would not be too tight.'' `` I think watching for signs of inflation is fine,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` But as a word of caution, I would n't want to see them step over some boundary that would ratchet down, tighten down, the economic growth.'' The nation is in its 65th month of economic expansion, a peacetime record. An economic downturn before the election could spell big troubles for Republicans' election prospects, most economic and political consultants agree. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign has been having some economic problems of its own lately _ a shortage of cash. Two months ago, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides reported that they only had $ 4 million left to spend before the Republican convention. Aide <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeter </PERSON> said Tuesday that the amount has now dwindled to just under $ 1.5 million. The vice president said over the weekend that the squeeze may mean some curtailing of campaign travel in the weeks ahead. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign has had no trouble raising money, but it is close to bumping up against the pre-convention federal spending limit of $ 27 million. The campaign has raised $ 29.5 million, of which about $ 2.5 is not subject to the ceiling.

 Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers throughout the nation. May 28 <ORGANIZATION> Lewiston </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> -RRB- Journal on the commercialization of Memorial Day: For too many others, the meaning of Memorial Day has been lost in the shuffle of commercial interests. For them, the day means little more than time off from school or work. It means officially opening up the cottage on the lake and having a picnic. It means a Memorial Day sale at the department store. ... <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, while admittedly responding to the call of many citizens, did n't help preserve the day's meaning by deciding in 1971 to change the observance of Memorial Day from May 30 ... to the last Monday of the month in order to give the citizenry a three-day weekend. ... The call to war may be the most dreaded anyone can face. But these men and women were there when their country needed them the most. They served in the interest of forging our freedom in the Revolutionary War, or preserving it in subsequent wars. For this, their memory must never be forsaken.

 May 27 <ORGANIZATION> Intelligencer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Lancaster </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, on the summit: Little of substance is promised in the summit between President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, but it is guaranteed to be historic. Not since ... the days of detente has the future between the two superpowers so brimmed with hope. The future appears bright for a number of reasons, beginning with the fact that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> are speaking to, rather than at, each other. Glasnost and perestroika have dulled the edge of speeches about an evil empire. Increased dialogue has inevitably led to better understanding. The three previous summits have shown that as leaders from the two superpowers get to know each other, their actions and responses are more predictable and stable. So the headline value of this summit may be nil. But in terms of the future, it may lay a solid foundation for further negotiations, which could lead to a notable cutback in nuclear weapons.

The <PERSON> Jatras </PERSON> letter accuses the governor of being soft on communism and violating Orthodox teaching because he supports the right to abortion. But the chief reason <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is not a communicant of the church, <PERSON> Jatras </PERSON> points out, is his marriage to a Jew. This sort of attack is beneath contempt. ...

 May 26 The <LOCATION> Duluth </LOCATION> -LRB- Minn. -RRB- News-Tribune on air safety: Now it's cracks in some airliners. How many more reports of deficiencies in the planes the public depends on for transportation can be issued before public confidence in the safety of American air transportation is entirely gone? In the past decade, confidence in air travel has been flagging to the point where some travelers refuse to book seats on certain kinds of planes. Certainly after the <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> problem, the `` elderly'' 737 will join those ranks. Maybe it's like putting a finger in a dike, but surely stricter inspection practices should be put in force and tests be conducted to determine just how old an airliner can be before it is retired.

That's not particularly startling news, but it could have an effect few have considered More and more of the wealthy are realizing the danger of cocaine and have stopped using it as a `` party drug.'' The message that cocaine is dangerous and addictive is getting through to the middle class. But, that same message is not making it to the inner city. Although it might not be as visible as it once was, cocaine ... remains a big problem. Writing it off as a plague of the inner city poor will not make it go away.

There are some groups in this nation who are fearful that any restriction on handguns, even those made of plastic, will somehow abridge their rights to bear arms. Hunters, law-abiding target-shooters and responsible citizens who arm themselves for their own defense hardly need to argue for armor-piercing bullets or undetectable pistols. We hope that the willingness of congressional leaders to take a stand ... despite threats of political retaliation at the polls, will lead to a candid and courageous review of a whole series of gun-control regulations.

 May 31 The Buffalo -LRB- <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> -RRB- News on legalization of drugs: A recent poll listed drug addiction as the nation's most important problem, and hardly a day goes by without news of drug-related crime or the corrosive effects of drug abuse on our society. Thus it comes as a shock to hear people actually proposing to legalize heroin, cocaine and marijuana. The mayors of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> and several congressmen declare that the war on drugs has failed and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should consider legalizing drugs and treating addiction as a health, not a crime, problem. Then addicts would not have to steal to get drugs, they argue, and the drug traffic, with all its corrupting influences, would fade away. There is a certain superficial appeal to this argument, which cites the example of Prohibition and the crime connected with it. But it is a desperate `` solution'' that only underlines how desperate the drug problem is. ... The move to legalize drugs is a well-meaning but misdirected effort.

Contrary to the doomsayers' predictions, we continue to enjoy strong economic growth with low inflation because we continue to make it easier for companies to produce goods. ... Unfortunately, we'll be lucky just to maintain the status quo.

 Democratic front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said today that `` of course'' rival candidate <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> deserves consideration for the No. 2 spot but added that he's not ready to make a choice with the last batch of primaries coming up next Tuesday. Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, meanwhile, looked on outside his <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> summer home as a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> member of a bipartisan deficit-reduction commission said the panel would not be swayed from doing its job by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s declaration that he would oppose any tax increase. Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Frenzel </PERSON>, R-Minn., said he thought such comments, which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> reiterated one day earlier, were premature <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> retorted: `` I hope the commission will listen a little bit to the American people in this election. I think that's what an election is all about. The commission can take an objective look at -LRB- taxes -RRB- and do whatever it wants. But I'd be more persuaded by what Americans say.'' <PERSON> Frenzel </PERSON> was among a group of economists and others meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Tuesday and today. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, called for expanded college opportunities for Americans and proposed a new national student loan program that would rely on payroll deductions for repayment. After the speech, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said that `` of course'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> deserved consideration for the vice presidency, but he answered with a blunt `` No'' when asked if <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> deserved special consideration because of his success during this year's primary elections. `` He's somebody who's done a remarkable job, has great gifts and great strengths,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said when asked if <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was qualified for a spot on the ticket. `` I respect and admire him a lot.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he had not given any thought to picking a running mate and would not do so until after the final primaries June 7. The biggest of those primaries will be in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, and both <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> were flying to that state late today for final-weekend campaigning. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, with virtually no chance of overtaking <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the national delegate race, is focusing increasingly on the Democratic National Convention in July and the clout he expects to wield there. `` I do not foresee confrontation,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said Tuesday as he campaigned in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. But he added that his supporters may take their issues to the full convention if they feel slighted by party platform writers. `` There's room to take one's case to the floor,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. He also said he has `` earned consideration'' for the No. 2 spot on the ticket, although he wo n't say whether he's interested in it. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been discouraging discussion of possible running mates. `` I can tell you I have not spent two minutes of my time on the subject,'' he told reporters after a <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> fund-raiser Tuesday night. As for any claims <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> might have, the front-runner said: `` He himself said he thought it was the nominee's responsibility to pick a running mate, and I agree with that.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is continuing to fire up crowds, even as he tacitly concedes that his presidential bid is all but finished. `` When our hope is alive, we push back mountains and remove ceilings,'' he told a crowd at a shopping center in <LOCATION> Willingboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> on Tuesday night. `` On our way to the White House, there are no more impossible dreams.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was campaigning in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> this morning, then leaving for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, for his part, was mapping out his post-primary strategy. His aides are indicating he'll plunge directly into his fall campaign after the final round of primaries on Tuesday in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Those contests are expected to give the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor a mathematical lock on the nomination. Rather than taking a traditional pre-convention break, however, the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ampaign will hit the road again. `` We want to spend a good part of June out there in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, traveling, telling people who <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is and why he would be a good president,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dach </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor was spending most of today on state business, then flying to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> tonight for two days of campaigning. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was still at his summer home in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, where he has been holding strategy sessions since last week. On Tuesday he met with economists, including <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldstein </PERSON>, the former chairman of the president's <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said after the meeting that he would reject any call for a federal tax hike, even if one is called for by a blue-ribbon bipartisan commission now working on ways to bring down the enormous federal deficit. `` I'll be saying, wait a minute, I've taken my case to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people to hold the line on taxes,'' the vice president said. However, he said that in order to carry out his education policies, local school taxes might have to be raised.

 A candidate for <LOCATION> Sonoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> supervisor whose handsome, square-jawed face appears smiling on campaign posters has angered some women who claim he is using his looks to win election. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 37, was the object of a demonstration Tuesday by placard-carrying women protesting the `` glitzification'' of county politics. `` He'd look better standing next to <PERSON> Vanna </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> than he does running for office,'' said <PERSON> Bebek </PERSON> <PERSON> McGee </PERSON>, leader of the demonstration downtown.

<HEAD>Summit Jarred Soviet Bureaucrats Into Rare Efficiency</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Is your air conditioning working? Would you like to interview any Soviet officials? Do you need to rent a car? How can I help? These are strange words, coming from Soviet managers who have elevated the ways of bureaucracy to a high art and service employees whose languor is renowned. But they were jarred into an unusual degree of efficiency and solicitous good manners when President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, hundreds of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government officials and nearly 5,000 journalists descended on the Soviet capital. The effort at being gracious summit hosts has not been flawless, but neither has it escaped the approving notice of foreign visitors who have known <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in its more natural state. A stack of pre-printed applications sat on a desk at the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s press center in the International Hotel. Reporters covering the summit could apply in writing for interviews with anyone from human rights activists to arms control negotiators. Physicist <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, a former human rights activist who was released from internal exile in 1986, plans to hold a news conference Friday at the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s request, because of numerous applications from visiting reporters. At the <LOCATION> Rossiya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hotel </LOCATION>, where many journalists are housed, cooks produced plates of three fried eggs Tuesday for breakfast guests who had grumbled a morning earlier when the dish was unavailable. Lettuce, unknown in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> except for a pale, bitter facsimile called `` salat,'' has been served at breakfast, lunch and dinner. Waitresses who usually slouch in the shadows have been scurrying about with fresh linen napkins. Fire prevention workers patrol the halls of the Rossiya, which sleeps 5,500 guests. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s ubiquitous police who ordinarily arrest offenders with a wave of their white-striped batons have settled for shrugs and tolerant smiles this week when confused American motorists make illegal turns. `` Is everything working to your satisfaction?'' a manager at the International Hotel inquired during his inspection of a room that had rented as summit office space. `` It's warm in here,'' he said. `` Is the air conditioning working?'' Soviet political commentators and social scientists have milled around the press center, giving and taking interviews and volunteering occasionally to serve as interpreters. The official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> went into full gear for its summit coverage. It published a stream of background articles, from the history of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catherine </ORGANIZATION>'s Hall to the menu for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s state dinner in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s honor Monday night. Ordinarily, information about the heavily guarded Kremlin or the <ORGANIZATION> Gorbachevs </ORGANIZATION>' socializing is treated like state secrets. The city, which was spruced up for the summit, has been unusually well maintained and operating smoothly this week. But all bets are off once <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> leaves Thursday to return home. The tenacious bureaucracy bends now and then, but it has never been known to break. Some state services have continued steadfastly in their old, inefficient ways of doing things. Intourist, the monopoly state travel agency, urged those traveling to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for the summit to hire interpreters and chauffeur-driven cars. Payment was required in advance, denying customers the chance to reduce or withhold payment for unsatisfactory service.

<HEAD>Court Says Deification of Slain Soldier Was Constitutional</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s armed forces did not violate the Constitution when a slain soldier was made a Shinto god against the wishes of his Christian widow, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled Wednesday. <PERSON> Yasuko </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakaya </PERSON> lost a 15-year battle when the nation's highest court reversed lower court decisions upholding her complaint. She said the Self Defense Forces had violated her constitutional freedom of religion by deifying her husband at a Shinto shrine. Her husband, 1st Lt. <PERSON> Takafumi </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakaya </PERSON>, was killed in a traffic accident while serving in the Ground Self Defense Forces in January 1968. Mrs. <PERSON> Nakaya </PERSON>, then 34 and a member of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, laid her husband's ashes to rest at <ORGANIZATION> Shinai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Yamaguchi </LOCATION>. He was not a Christian. Four years after his death, <PERSON> Nakaya </PERSON> was enshrined and deified. His widow filed her suit the next year, in 1973. In her legal action, the first individual lawsuit contesting the government on an issue involving religion, Mrs. <PERSON> Nakaya </PERSON> also sought $ 8,000 in compensation from the government for her mental anguish. `` I have long suspected that the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> was an institution obsequious to the powerful. Today, I'm sorry to see that the court is,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Nakaya </PERSON> told reporters after the decision. <PERSON> Takako </PERSON> <PERSON> Doi </PERSON>, leader of the major opposition <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, told the same news conference: `` I would call the ruling a compromise by the guardian of the constitution made in favor of the government's way of thinking. `` I feel like we're being driven back to the past,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Doi </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Nakaya </PERSON> has said she filed the suit to challenge the possible revival of the militarism that revolved around <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s traditional Shintoism before and during World War II Before 1945, soldiers killed in action or while on duty were automatically given the status of gods and their names were inscribed in Shinto shrines. The practice was discontinued under the new constitution, which guarantees freedom of religion and was written under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> guidance after <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s defeat. But soldiers killed on duty are sometimes enshrined at the request of the association of retired <ORGANIZATION> Self </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> members, called `` taiyukai.'' In its 14-1 vote Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said the armed forces were not directly involved in the case of Lt. <PERSON> Nakaya </PERSON> and that the `` taiyukai'' had him enshrined. The lower courts had ruled that the armed forces had a direct role in the enshrinement. Shintoism is said to have emerged at the dawn of Japanese history and crystalized as a religious system during the <LOCATION> Nara </LOCATION> period in the eighth century. As the state religion before 1945, it stressed the divinity of the emperor and the worship of nature, ancestors and ancient heroes. The military used Shinto shrines and ceremonies to promote nationalism among the Japanese. The Rev. <PERSON> Mototsugu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogata </PERSON>, chief guardian of the <LOCATION> Gokoku </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shrine </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Yamaguchi </LOCATION>, said in a telephone interview, `` Lt. <PERSON> Nakaya </PERSON> is one of a total of 52,099 enshrined in a big, tall sacred mirror at this shrine ... established in 1941. They are mostly those killed in World War II.'' Like the others, <PERSON> Nakaya </PERSON>'s name has been written in a sacred list as `` mikoto <PERSON> Takafumi </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakaya </PERSON>,'' said the Shinto priest. `` Mikoto'' is the Shinto term for god or deity. The religion respects several types of deities, including ancestral gods, gods revered for virtues, gods revered for their works and gods whose wrath is to be feared. Shintoism, a religion of ceremony rather than dogma, coexists in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> with Buddhism, the other major religion. The exact number of adherents is not known, and many Japanese practice both religions. There are also about 1 million Christians among the 122 million Japanese.

<DATELINE>HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Rapists, killers and robbers were among 113 rebels who surrendered under an amnesty that guarantees immunity from prosecution, police said Wednesday. Officials said the amnesty was a success and they believe virtually all the rebels turned themselves in by the deadline at midnight Tuesday. `` I can not think of any dissidents still remaining in the <PERSON> bush </PERSON>,'' Wednesday's <ORGANIZATION> Harare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> newspaper quoted Home Minister <PERSON> Moven </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahachi </PERSON> as saying. <PERSON> Mahachi </PERSON> said intelligence estimates were that 100 to 120 rebels were at large before President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> announced the amnesty April 19. Among those granted amnesty is <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sango </PERSON>, who was <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>'s most wanted man and called himself <PERSON> Gayigusu </PERSON> _ `` Grind the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'' in the Ndebele language <PERSON> Sango </PERSON>, in his 30s, fought as a guerrilla in the seven-year war that transformed the white-governed British colony of <LOCATION> Rhodesia </LOCATION> into black-governed <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> on April 18, 1980. He deserted from the army in 1982 after <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> <PERSON> Nkomo </PERSON>, the former opposition leader, was fired from a coalition government for allegedly plotting a coup against <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON>. Most of the rebels were loyal to <PERSON> Nkomo </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Zimbabwe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, whose power base is the minority <PERSON> Ndebele </PERSON> tribe. <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON>'s ruling <ORGANIZATION> Zimbabwe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- is strongest in his dominant <PERSON> Shona </PERSON> tribe. As a dissident gang leader roaming the rolling <PERSON> bush </PERSON> country of <LOCATION> Matabeleland </LOCATION> province in western <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, the Ndebele homeland, <PERSON> Sango </PERSON> was blamed for a wave of murder, robbery and rape. He is alleged to have led the gang that axed 16 white missionaries and family members to death six months ago, including five children and five women, on two Pentecostal communal farms near <LOCATION> Bulawayo </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Matabeleland </LOCATION> provincial capital. Like the others who surrendered under the amnesty, <PERSON> Sango </PERSON> is immune from prosecution that almost certainly would have cost him his life. The government has promised a rehabilitation program to ease them bak into society. <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> offered the amnesty, the first since independence, after he and <PERSON> Nkomo </PERSON> signed an agreement Dec. 23 to merge their political parties. An amnesty <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> offered under a cease-fire before independence was accepted by about 50,000 guerrillas loyal to either <PERSON> Nkomo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON>, some of whom were among the 113 who turned themselves in this time. `` Smelling Blood'' <PERSON> Mavovonka </PERSON> led the last gang of 12 men to surrender hours before the deadline. He told reporters in the <LOCATION> Nkayi </LOCATION> district of northern <LOCATION> Matabeleland </LOCATION>: `` We went out to the <PERSON> bush </PERSON> because of misunderstandings. Our leaders have now seen that what they were doing was wrong and they have corrected their mistakes. That's why we are here.'' <PERSON> Mahachi </PERSON>, the home minister, said last week the amnesty would not be extended and rebels refusing it would be hunted down and killed. `` I am sure the amnesty is 100 percent successful,'' he said Tuesday. `` There may be one or two or three still outstanding. The problem is that we were not certain of the total number, but the number which we have received is about what we expected it to be.''

 A car bomb exploded in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Wednesday on the first anniversary of Prime Minister <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> <PERSON> Karami </PERSON>'s assassination. Police said there were no casualties. The car bombing, the first in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> this year, was reported at 8:20 a.m. in the <LOCATION> Bir </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hassan </LOCATION> district during a strike to mark <PERSON> Karami </PERSON>'s assassination. A police spokesman said the stolen white <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION> was loaded with 44 pounds of TNT. `` The explosion shattered glass in the area but no casualties were reported, apparently because the streets were empty because of the strike,'' said the spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity according to regulations. Banks, schools, shops, government offices, gas stations and other businesses closed in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and other Moslem cities in accordance with the strike call. <PERSON> Karami </PERSON>, a Syrian-backed Sunni Moslem politician, was 65 when he was killed June 1, 1987 by a bomb explosion aboard a Lebanese army helicopter that was flying him from north <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Pro-Syrian Moslem leaders have accused <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> rightist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> militias of assassinating <PERSON> Karami </PERSON>. The Jewish state and the command of the Christian militia denied involvement. An official investigation has issued no finding. The explosion on Wednesday was the third car bombing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this year. On April 23, <PERSON> Karami </PERSON>'s hometown of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> was rocked by a powerful car bomb explosion that killed 69 people and wounded 111. A blue <ORGANIZATION> Volvo </ORGANIZATION> car rigged with 220 pounds of <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION> exploded in Christian east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Monday, killing 20 people and wounding 78. The Lebanese Forces blamed <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> for Monday's attack, which came four days after 2,400 Syrian troops deployed in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s southern slums to end three weeks of fighting between rival Shiite Moslem militias that killed nearly 300 people and wounded 1,000.

<TEXT>
 Management locked out 20,000 striking workers at a <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> plant Wednesday and said there was little chance of settling a 3-day-old strike for higher wages. Meanwhile, at <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Precision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Changwon </LOCATION>, striking workers freed one of the 11 company executives they took hostage Friday. Both companies are subsidiaries of the massive <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> group conglomerate. Officials at <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s largest carmaker, said they had no choice but to lock out workers in <LOCATION> Ulsan </LOCATION> on the nation's southeast coast. `` The lockout is inevitable because there are little chances of resolving the dispute in a short period of time,'' said one company executive who spoke on condition of anonymity. After two days of work slowdown, <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> workers struck on Monday, demanding wage increases of up to $ 180 a month. The company offered $ 105. The company employs 25,000 people, including 20,000 union members who went on strike and 5,000 management workers who remained at work. After the lockout on Wednesday, the carmaker's unionized workers left the plant and said they would not return at least until Monday. They said they would help farmers with the spring rice planting during the period. <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> workers earn an average of $ 610 a month after one year, $ 750 after five years and $ 960 after 13 years, the company said. <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> officials said the strike cost them $ 18.6 million a day in lost sales. About two-thirds of the Hyundai production are intended for exports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and other countries. At <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Precision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in the southern city of <LOCATION> Changwon </LOCATION>, 2,000 striking workers released Chairman <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> Mong-ku. He was taken from the plant to a hospital where he was treated for high blood presure and exhaustion. Company President <PERSON> Yoo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ki-chul </PERSON> and nine other high-ranking officials were still being held by the strikers. Workers blocked all gates to the plant where the 2,000 workers produce trains and unspecified defense equipment. Hyundai Precision workers took the officials hostage to press their demand for wage increases of up to $ 180 a month. The company offered a $ 55 increase. Company officials and strikers agreed after 10 hours of talks to resume negotiations Thursday on calls for higher wages. The company agreed to give <PERSON> Yoo </PERSON> full power to negotiate with the union. <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> officials said they would ask the government not to bring criminal charges against union members who seized parts of the plant and held <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> hostage. The deal followed a government warning that police would be used to rescue the executives. All 2,000 workers at another <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> Precision plant in <LOCATION> Ulsan </LOCATION> went on strike on Friday to demand higher wages. A striker who stabbed himself in a suicide attempt Tuesday was reported in fair condition at a hospital. Ritual suicide is a traditional form of protest used to try and shame or discredit superiors such as the government or company executives. In another development, Justice Minister <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> <PERSON> Hae-chang </PERSON> on Wednesday ruled out the possibility of releasing more political prisoners in the near future. `` The government is not considering taking any extraordinary actions to release political offenders,'' <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> told reporters. <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> pointed out that the government had already released 1,275 political prisoners under three amnesties since summer 1987 and reinstrated the civic rights of 8,710 people who were blacklisted for political offense. `` There are few people who are eligible for amnesty. Another exceptional amnesty would be detrimental to maintaining law and order,'' <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> said. The opposition demanded that the government of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo free all `` prisoners of conscience'' as a step toward full democracy. The opposition recently said there are 560 political prisoners it wants released. Government officials said the opposition list includes some alleged <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> spies and many who were already set free. The officials say about 200 political offenders are currently in jail, serving terms or awaiting trial.

<HEAD>Jewish Emigration From Soviet Reaches Seven-Year High</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Jewish emigration from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> reached a new seven-year high in May with 1,145 Jews allowed to leave, the agency helping them resettle said Wednesday. May marked the fourth straight month of rising Jewish emigration, bringing the total for 1988 to 4,547 Soviet Jews arriving at the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, transit center, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Intergovernmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Migration </ORGANIZATION>. But the number going to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has declined, with only 97 of the May arrivals resettling there, committee spokeswoman <PERSON> Regina </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucault </PERSON> said. In April, 1,077 Soviet Jews emigrated and 162 went to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The May figure was the highest since April 1981, when 1,155 Jews left the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. More than 250,000 Jews have found new homes since the <ORGANIZATION> Intergovernmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> for Migration resettlement program began in 1971. In the early years, most proceeded to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> but recently the number has declined sharply. The committee did not include figures for the number of Soviet Jews coming through <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rumania </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shmuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Binsky </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Soviet Jewry in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> said 24 Jews emigrated through <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> in May. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, a Soviet Jewish activist told the news agency <ORGANIZATION> Itim </ORGANIZATION> that the number of Soviet Jewish emigrants who decided against coming to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> reached a record high in May, when more than 90 percent chose to settle elsewhere. <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Chessler </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewry </ORGANIZATION>, was quoted as saying on Tuesday that soon no Soviet Jewish emigrants will come to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> unless they are flown via <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> instead of <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, where they are free to immigrate to other Western countries. Israeli officials are embarrassed by the high dropout figure because of their 20-year-long battle for the right of Soviet Jews to emigrate on the grounds that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is their homeland. Israeli leaders claim 400,000 Soviet Jews want to settle in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. But less than 20 percent of those who leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> actually settle there. <PERSON> Chessler </PERSON> said that of the 1,169 Jews who left the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> in May, just 110 came to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, a drop of nearly 7 percent from April.

<TEXT>
 Before concluding my statement, let me just share with you one general impression _ and if I did not mention this, I would not be honest with you or truthful, if I omitted to say this: It is my impression ... there is a lot of contradictions in the American position. ... Now, let me explain where I see this contrariness. On the one hand, we have a joint statement that there should be no war, that war is inadmissible, we are engaged in a businesslike dialogue about arms reductions, we're talking about preferences for political solutions. And yet, on the other hand, we keep hearing ... _ we heard words about a stake made on strength. ... This is to be seen in the economic ties also, where an authoritative part _ sections of the American business circles are in favor of cooperation, but they are faced with intimidation with all sorts of restrictions. There is indeed a most unfavored nation treatment in respect to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. We had a very intense discussion with the president yesterday on this subject. And I asked, `` Why should the dead hold onto the coattails of the living?'' I mean the Jackson-Vanik Amendment. One of them's already physically dead. The other's politically dead. `` Why should they hang onto our coattails?'' I asked. This was _ the amendment was passed in a totally different situation a decade ago, but in this changed world of ours, we should think and base our policies on present day realities. ... Q. You mentioned twice in your comments just a few moments ago, you talked about missing chances, and you have also talked about politics is the art of the possible. So I ask you with this administration and its president, is it going to be possible to have a treaty, to have a START -LRB- strategic arms reduction -RRB- treaty, if the Americans insist on keeping the SDI -LRB- strategic defense initiative -RRB- program going? GORBACHEV: I am sure that there still is a possibility to achieve a treaty this year and I'm reinforced in this optimism by the headway we have made _ <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> have made in this past period _ and also the exchange of views here almost around the clock. It gives me grounds to voice such an optimistic assessment. ... Q. Mr. General Secretary, several times in the past few days you were asked if there would be a fifth summit conference with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> possible in the fall, and you answered usually, `` Yes, it is possible, it is possible, but it depends on how things go at this meeting.'' Now that this meeting is about over, do you see enough headway _ progress _ to warrant a fifth meeting with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in the fall? GORBACHEV: I link the possibility to arrive at a treaty, and therefore, I believe, that a fifth meeting is also possible, and that possibility is still at the very real. So, the whole thing hinges upon that one question. ... Q. The Arab countries highly assess your recent words about the Palestinians who are now waging a courageous struggle against the Israeli occupiers. Would you tell me what you achieved in your meetings with Mr. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on the <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> issue and on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> settlement as a whole? GORBACHEV: ... There is an understanding among the international community and in the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> among its permanent members that the solution should be solved along the lines of an international conference. The content of that conference has not yet been determined though. ... We can not decide for the Arabs, how the Palestinians participate in the international conference. Let them decide for themselves, let the Arabs decide. What we should do, the Americans and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, we should respect their decision. It's a vast Arab world out there, and we must recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to security. We must recognize the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination. In what form? Let the Palestinians, with their friends the Arabs, decide on that. ... Q. There's been a wide perception that differences over the American SDI program have been one of the major obstacles to a START Treaty. Have you made any progress in resolving differences over SDI at this summit? If so, exactly what progress has been made? And do you still continue to believe that that may be a major obstacle in reaching a START Treaty? GORBACHEV: In responding to your last question I say yes, I do, because it means destabilization and it does n't meet normal logic to reduce strategic offensive arms on land and to build a bridge for such arms into outer space. Although the Americans say that this is a purely defensive weapon, we do not think that is. ... Allegedly the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side is ready to share its secrets with us. And I said to the president at that time, I said, `` Permit me, Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, not to agree with you and to call in question that statement of yours. Why? Because right now we ca n't even agree on how to verify sea-based cruise missiles on two types of vessels because you're not ready to agree. So how can we rely on your divulging all of your secrets concerning SDI? That's just not serious, it's beyond the framework of reality.'' ...

 While police searched <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s sewers for bombs and set up barricades Wednesday, the Lord Mayor's harried staff spruced up the 12th century Guildhall where President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will speak en route home from the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit. Clearly unaccustomed to the tumult surrounding <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidential visits, the mayor's spokeswoman, <PERSON> Carole </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbone </PERSON>, glanced at the city's motto inscribed on the Guildhall _ `` Domine Dirige Nos.'' `` It means ` God Direct Us,' or the alternative version, ` God Help Us,''' she chuckled as workers strung up <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flags, lugged in potten chrysanthemums and polished the Lord Mayor's silverware <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> arrives Thursday, the final leg of a 10-day trip that also took him to <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The president wrapped up his summit with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on Wednesday, as both leaders stressed improved relations between the superpowers and pledged to press forward with their quest for a treaty their arsenals of strategic nuclear weapons by 30 percent to 50 percent.

 The Iraqi army `` set up'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in April for one of its worst military defeats with an elaborate, month-long deception campaign of troop movements that demonstrated the growing maturity of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s forces, senior <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials say. Having rapidly recaptured the <LOCATION> Faw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION> six weeks ago in an operation that succeeded beyond all expectation, the Iraqis since have reclaimed another piece of their occupied territory near the southern city of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> with a similar surprise attack, the officials noted. The victories mean it now is conceivable that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> can break the stalemate in the 7 -LCB- - year war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, the sources continued While there is no evidence that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> will try to invade <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, it appears <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> now has the ability to `` systematically evict'' Iranian troops from its territory, the officials said. Such victories, when coupled with the political and economic problems confronting <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, may be enough to force a truce settlement. The sources _ ranking defense officials with access to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence data _ agreed to discuss developments in the Iran-Iraq war during interviews conducted over the past week. The officials, who spoke only upon condition they not be named, suggested the administration had new reason to hope the Iran-Iraq war might wind down _ allowing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to reduce its own commitment of naval forces to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. The sources agreed that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> had surprised not only <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> but also <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence agencies with the timing of its land offensives. They further disclosed: _ <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> spent the month before the April 17 attack on the Faw peninsula moving troops all around the country, generally toward the north When they were ready, the Iraqis used their superior roads and military logistical system to send 50,000 to 60,000 troops streaming back south to <LOCATION> Faw </LOCATION> in one coordinated movement. `` They set up the Iranians masterfully,'' one official said. `` The Iranians never saw it coming.'' `` They achieved surprise,'' a second official added. `` In the course of this plan, they moved units around in ways that Iranian intelligence were likely to be deceived, then reassembled these units in a stealthy and rather sudden way. ... `` And they just ran over the Iranians like a steamroller running over a cockroach. It was really something. They had expected it -LRB- the operation -RRB- to take five days and it took them a day and a half.'' This source noted the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> military had received `` an awfully lot of bad press'' in the past, `` but our conclusion has been that they've gotten steadily better. We have observed with interest the maturation of the Iraqi armed forces as an entity.'' _ In the course of retaking the <LOCATION> Faw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION>, `` the Iraqis digested real quickly the fact the Iranians really did n't fight very well,'' one official said Thus emboldened, the Iraqis set up another assault operation and punched through Iranian lines near <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> on May 25, once again routing Iranian forces. `` This was another steamroller,'' an official said. `` It took the Iranians a couple of months to capture -LRB- this area -RRB-, with 60,000 to 65,000 dead. The Iraqi army and air force recaptured it in five hours.'' _ The Iraqis recently provided yet another example of their willingness to become more aggressive, mounting a major air strike against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Larak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> oil terminal Iraqi jet fighters have struck the terminal before. What made the May 14 attack different, the sources said, was the willingness of the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> pilots to slow down, fly low and use heavy iron bombs instead of guided missiles. The bombs pack much more explosive power than missiles like the Exocet and the result was that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> `` just drilled'' several huge oil tankers, putting them out of commission. _ <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> appears to be suffering real recruitment problems in convincing its youth to join the Revolutionary Guard for duty at the front lines The Iranians have been `` equipment-poor'' for some time; `` now they're becoming a people-poor armed force,'' one official said. _ <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is going out of its way to monitor the location of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships and refraining from attacks on merchant vessels if <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships are close enough to intervene, the sources said

<HEAD>Church of England To Drop Controversial Anonymous Essay</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> said Wednesday it will drop the traditional anonymous preface from its next directory because a theologian committed suicide after using the last one to criticize the archbishop of <LOCATION> Canterbury </LOCATION>. A joint statement by the <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commissioners </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION>, which oversee church investments and assets, said the commentary was `` no longer a viable option.'' Asked to elaborate, a spokesman cited `` a lot of publicity and the search by the media for the author and the tragic death of <PERSON> Gareth </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>.'' He spoke on condition of anonymity. The preface will be dropped from the 1989-90 edition of <PERSON> Crockford </PERSON>'s Clerical Directory, the official biennial list of Anglican clergy, but no decision has been made on whether to eliminate it permanently, the statement said. `` It has only been dropped for the 1989 edition to allow us more time to consider,'' the spokesman said. `` We shall consider the position again later.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, a 68-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> canon, was found dead Dec. 7, five days after the 1987-88 edition of the directory appeared with his preface. It accused Archbishop of Canterbury <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> of being indecisive and overly influenced by liberal pressure groups, and of surrounding himself with liberal bishops. <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> is spiritual leader of the church and leads the world's 70 million Anglicans, including 3 million American Episcopalians. The preface attacked moves within the state church toward ordaining women as priests, an issue it said was spreading disunity through the Anglican communion. Although the article was not signed, suspicion fell on <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> because of his stature in the church's conservative wing, his influential position and his academic distinction. <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON>, 66, often has criticized Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s conservative policies, and the preface was widely interpreted as the beginning of a campaign to bring about his retirement and prevent a liberal from succeeding. Bishops and archbishops customarily retire on their 70th birthday. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> denied to colleagues and reporters that he wrote the preface, but was found dead in the garage of his home with a hose leading into his car from the exhaust pipe. Church officials later confirmed he was the author. He did not leave a suicide note, but wrote in a diary four days before his death: `` I should be lucky to weather this business through without disaster.'' A strong clue to authorship was the preface's informed criticism of divisions among Episcopalians in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> following ordination of women priests there. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> had been a visiting professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> since 1975. The Church Commissioners and <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> said they considered publishing a signed commentary in the next directory, but decided against it.

<HEAD>Two First Ladies Maneuver For Spotlight In Feisty `Mexican
Standoff'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> dropped all pretense of a hand-holding friendship Wednesday in a feisty competition for the spotlight that Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> called a `` Mexican standoff.'' President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and General Secretary <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> traded generous comments as their fourth summit drew to a close, but their wives managed to erase within minutes the image of a warm relationship they'd tried to portray earlier in the week. Although the two women maintained the appearance of cordiality during a tour of an icon storage vault, their contest for the spotlight was the toughest of any of their get-togethers since they met in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in 1985. `` I want to say something. I want to say something now, OK?'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> cut in at sharply one point as Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> attempted to stop reporters from questioning the American first lady. Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> backed away, but pointedly looked at her watch as the first lady chatted with members of the White House press corps. The incident recalled a similar one during the December summit in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, when Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> frequently offered comments about history, art and political life, as Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> attempted to get in a few words. Since then, press accounts have dwelled on the apparent coolness in the women's relationship. But during several of their sessions this week, Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> took Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s hand in a public gesture of friendship, as she did on their Sunday stroll about the Kremlin's Cathedral Square. During Wednesday's session with reporters, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> laughed at the maneuvering that had just occurred, shrugged and declared, `` a Mexican standoff.'' Later, the first lady's press secretary, <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON>, said of the two women, `` They are from two totally different worlds.'' Noting that Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has spoken out more in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> than she did at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> summit, Mrs. <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> said she believed they now had `` more balance'' and equality in their relationship. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had requested a viewing of the famed icons at the <ORGANIZATION> Tretyakov </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gallery </ORGANIZATION>, which houses the finest collection of <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> art in the world. It was begun by <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Tretyakov </PERSON>, the son of a wealthy <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> merchant, who donated it to the state in 1892. The museum has been closed for renovation since 1986. Instead of meeting Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as planned by the outside door of the gallery, Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had come to the special vault where they were to view the art and informed the waiting press corp that they could have `` a dialogue'' about the masterpieces of medieval icon painting. `` The guests are late,'' she noted. The Soviet first lady then expounded on the 12th and 13th century works, quoting the great Russian author <PERSON> Feodor </PERSON> <PERSON> Dostoevsky </PERSON> as she pointed to the `` Virgin of <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON>,'' which is revered as having saved <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> from the Tartars. Another, `` The Trinity,'' by <PERSON> Andrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Roblov </PERSON>, is said to be the most beautiful icon ever painted. After Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> arrived and the two women shook hands, Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> presented her with a bouquet of pink roses and a large coffee-table style book of pictures from the gallery. She also presented reporters with a copy of the same book, proposing that they give it to `` whomever has covered the summit best.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> raised her eyebrows in a look of mild consternation. She then stepped forward, insisting that she had something she wanted to say. She thanked Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and the gallery staff and said she was aware few people were granted a chance to view rare icon collection. When reporters then tried to question the two women, Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> tried again to get the tour under way, saying, `` We have decided there would not be any interviews.'' But journalists pressed Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to respond, telling her that she should have `` equal time'' with the Soviet first lady. Upon realizing that Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had spoken at length with reporters before she arrived, a broad smile crossed Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s face and she plunged into her own dialogue. Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> then retreated to the background. Told that Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had not mentioned the icons' religious heritage, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> responded, `` I do n't know how you can neglect the religious implications. I mean they are there, when you see them.'' Asked if she'd become a convert to communism during her trip, the first lady laughed heartily, saying, `` Oh, no,'' adding that the Soviets were n't ready to convert to capitalism, either. `` We have two different ways of living, two different philosophies,'' she said.

 Q. While 5,000 journalists have been here for the summit, suddenly Soviet domestic politics have become rather unusual. -LRB- Ousted <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Communist Party leader -RRB- Mr. <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, in an interview on television, calls for the resignation of -LRB- the Kremlin's No. 2 man -RRB- Mr. -LRB- <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>. ... How do you assess the current political situation in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as we move into the party conference period? And what is your opinion of Mr. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s call for Mr. <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>'s resignation? GORBACHEV: ... -LRB- Comrade <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> -RRB- is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> CPSU </ORGANIZATION>, after all. So what he says and what he talks about was in fact a subject for discussion at the October plenary meeting last year. Twenty-seven people spoke out at that meeting, and just as you are asking me questions, he suddenly came up and his statement, the statement he made at that meeting, was _ had not been planned. ... The opinion of all of the 27 speakers was that the generalizations made by Comrade <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> concerning various aspects of activity of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, the activity of the Secretariat, the Politburo, that opinion was wrong. And his statement was recognized as being politically erroneous. So the discussion was there, the decision was taken, and so Comrade <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> seems to be in disagreement with the decision taken by the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Well then, if that is so, we must ask him in the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and we shall demand that he explain his position and what he's out for. It means that his opinion is at a variance with the opinion of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> of the Party. As for <PERSON> Comrade </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> and his retirement, that problem simply is nonexistent, and that's all. That's what you should proceed from, and that's the way it will be. ... Q. Mr. Secretary, when you were in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, you said to Mr. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was prepared to stop arms deliveries to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> stopped financing the Contras. Then later -LRB- Soviet Foreign Minister -RRB- Mr. -LRB- <LOCATION> Eduard </LOCATION> -RRB- <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and -LRB- Secretary of State -RRB- Mr. -LRB- <PERSON> George </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> discussed that issue, and we were told that the Soviet position had changed to an agreement to stop deliveries to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> stopped deliveries to the whole of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Can you explain to us the reason for the change in that position, if it's correct, and what you discussed today on <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>? Did that advance the issue? GORBACHEV: Today we had a detailed discussion of this problem _ very detailed. We looked back at the history, and when we do look back into history, we have different explanations and views. But I suggested that we take as a starting point today's reality. The Contadora process is with us, the <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> Accords. There's been an armistice, a cease-fire. And there is some movement towards a political settlement, and we must base ourselves on that process and lend our support and give an opportunity to the forces opposing each other. ...

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, to the surprise of some refuseniks, said Wednesday that emigration barriers preventing people from leaving the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> may be the result of bureacratic snags rather than deliberate Kremlin policy. In a summit-finale news conference, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also said that it was General Secretary <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> who changed his view of the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> as an `` evil empire.'' He said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, his partner at four summit meetings, was `` different than previous Soviet leaders have been.'' The president said he hoped to conclude a U.S.-Soviet treaty to cut strategic nuclear arsenals by half before leaving office, but said it was more important to get a good agreement than to meet a January deadline. Winding up his first visit to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> answered questions at a news conference under hot television lights in a ballroom of the <ORGANIZATION> Spaso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the American Embassy residence where he stayed during his five-day visit here. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> refused to rule out the possibility of a fifth summit before leaving office in eight months. `` Something else might come up that necessitates our getting together and settling something other than that particular treaty,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. He was referring to the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty -LRB- START -RRB-, still being negotiated by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` So, no one can say, no, there will be no need for a summit,'' the president added. Avoiding any direct criticism of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> leadership believed that his meetings in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> with Soviet dissidents, refuseniks and others constituted interference in internal matters. The topic had been a centerpiece of his activities here, but abruptly ended after a speech Tuesday at <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. At his news conference, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was asked repeatedly about his comment a day earlier about dissidents and refuseniks, people who have been denied visas and often lose their jobs or are otherwise punished for merely seeking permission to leave or speaking out against the Soviet system. `` I'm not blaming you; I'm blaming bureaucracy,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had told a Soviet questioner. `` We have the same type of thing happen in our country ...'' Asked Wednesday if he thought the problem merely was one of bureaucratic intransigence instead of a deliberate policy, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` No, I ca n't say that _ it's one I do n't know that much about the system.'' The questioner persisted, asking if he were n't `` letting Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> off a little easy on just saying it's a bureaucracy?'' `` I just have to believe that in any government some of us do find ourselves bound in by bureaucracy, and then sometimes you have to stomp your foot and say, unmistakably, I want it done. `` And then maybe you get through with it. But I have great confidence in his ability to do that,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. However, his answer met immediate skepticism. <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> <PERSON> Stolar </PERSON>, a Chicago-born Jew who has been trying to get his family out of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> since 1975, said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s answer was `` naive. Maybe that's a bad word to use, may it's just innocent.'' <PERSON> Stolar </PERSON> said `` I personelly believe that it is Soviet policy. None of it is accidental and none of it is purely bureaucratic.'' <PERSON> Tanya </PERSON> <PERSON> Zieman </PERSON>, a Soviet refusenik, asked if she felt the bureacracy was responsible, said, `` Of course not. The bureaucracy has nothing to do with it.'' She speculated that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> merely did not want to spoil some agreement with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on human rights. `` My impression was that he just did n't want to anger our side more,'' she said. `` My feeling is as if some agreement is reached and he does not want to hamper it by saying nasty things.'' <PERSON> Zieman </PERSON>'s family was to have been visited by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> until Soviet authorities passed word that the family would never be allowed to leave if <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> paid a call. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> met with reporters shortly after <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. At the first news conference he had ever held in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader noted with pleasure that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had retracted his characterization of this country as an `` evil empire.''

<HEAD>Afghan Insurgents Claim Capture of 32 Government Posts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Afghan Moslem guerrillas said they overran 32 government military posts around the Afghan provincial capital of <LOCATION> Baghlan </LOCATION> near a major Soviet troop withdrawal route. The report could not be independently verified, and Western diplomatic sources contacted Wednesday in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> said they could not confirm it. They said it sounded exaggerated, but they agreed it could indicate there was heavy fighting around the city 120 miles north of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and 75 miles south of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The Peshawar-based <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> said in a telex statement Tuesday night that 1,500 troops and militiamen fighting for the communist government surrendered or were captured around <LOCATION> Baghlan </LOCATION> between May 22 and May 28. It said the insurgents captured nearly 900 automatic rifles and machine guns and `` millions of rounds of ammunition.'' The statement said fighting was still going at the time of the broadcast on Tuesday. It did not say whether the fighting involved Soviet forces or just <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government troops. The U.S.-backed guerrillas say they already control the area surrounding the southern part of the road below the mountains, but they say they are letting the retreating <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> pass peacefully. Soviet troops entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 and replaced the communist government with another one. More than 100,000 troops have been helping the Marxist government fight Moslem rebels. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> signed an agreement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> last month in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> to withdraw its troops, and the pullout began May 15.

 Salvadoran President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napolean </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, admitted to <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> for treatment of what he called a bleeding ulcer `` of a malignant nature,'' began tests today to determine if his condition could be cancer. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, 62, was taken to <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> after arriving Tuesday night at <ORGANIZATION> Andrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Esker </PERSON> said today that <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> `` rested comfortably last night and began medical evaluation and tests this morning. `` He is in good spirits and his condition is stable,'' <PERSON> Esker </PERSON> said in a short statement. `` It is not appropriate to comment further until all his tests are completed.'' <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s illness has been described by those around him as both an `` ulcer'' and as `` a tumor.'' The Salvadoran president himself said it was an ulcer of `` a malignant nature.'' A physician who is an expert on stomach diseases, but who is not associated with <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s care, said that it often is difficult to determine if an illness is the result of an ulcer or is caused by a stomach cancer. `` It is not at all uncommon for there to be confusion,'' said Dr. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. `` When you look at the two things, they may be very similar.'' Extensive tests or even surgery may be required to resolve the question, <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said. As he prepared to leave from <LOCATION> Illopango </LOCATION> military airport in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> on Tuesday, <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> told reporters of his illness and described himself as `` a man who fights.'' ` The designs of God are unpredictable,'' <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> said. `` What I have is a bleeding ulcer seven centimeters -LRB- 2 -LCB- inches -RRB- long in the stomach, of a malignant nature. `` The doctors have said that the prognosis is reserved until studies are made in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ... I do n't know what is going to happen.'' Asked how to interpret <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s description of his ulcer presidential spokeswoman <PERSON> Ana </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON> wiped away tears and said: `` What do you want him to say? Cancer? He ca n't.'' Ulcers in themselves are neither malignant nor benign. Media Communications Minister <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Viera </PERSON>, asked about the president's statement, said <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> has `` a large tumor'' in his stomach. `` The doctors do n't want to characterize it until they do a biopsy,'' <PERSON> Viera </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> told reporters: `` You all know me. I have been a man of crisis, a man of battle, a man who fights. I have fought against all the vicissitudes, against dictatorships for so many years in search of democracy; against the country's biggest crisis; against an earthquake, three droughts. And now God gives me this other test.'' He traveled to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> aboard a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> C-141 transport aircraft converted into a hospital plane for the six-hour flight to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> bid farewell at the airport to about 200 members of the Cabinet, legislature, supreme court and diplomatic corps, clasping many of the dignitaries in long embraces. His wife <PERSON> Ines </PERSON>, next to him on a slightly raised platform, wiped away tears. The climate of the ceremony was one of barely concealed grief, with members of <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s extended family weeping and rubbing reddened eyes. The absence leaves Vice President <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> <PERSON> Claramount </PERSON> in charge. The president, a staunch <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ally who is in the final year of his five-year term, leaves a troubled country. Leftist guerrillas are waging an 8-year-old campaign to topple the government. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> suffered a telling defeat in legislative and municipal elections in March. The rightist <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, or <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>, won control of the unicameral congress, which had been dominated by <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s party. The Christian Democrats are torn by infighting that has threatened to split the organization. Former Cabinet Minister <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rey </PERSON> <PERSON> Prendes </PERSON> was declared the party presidential candidate at a convention last month. But rival <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON>, backed by a significant party sector, challenges the validity of the nomination.

<DATELINE>GRAND TETON NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 With the tourist season under way, superintendents of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> convened an extraordinary meeting today on how to safeguard <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s natural heritage and were told to `` stand up for your park's resources.'' The four-day conference at <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lodge </LOCATION>, the first of its kind in 12 years, was called by <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> <PERSON> Mott </PERSON>. All 341 superintendents were invited to the gathering in the shadow of the <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Teton </LOCATION>. `` If the last decade has taught us anything, it is that parks are no longer islands,'' said <PERSON> Mott </PERSON>. `` I am asking you to stand up for your park's resources. ... We can not expect someone else to do that for us. We must be willing to do that ourselves.'' The director said coming together in `` this beautiful place will renew our creativity, replenish the strength of our commitment, and unite us in meeting the wonderful and awesome challenges ahead.'' <PERSON> Mott </PERSON> described the National Park system as the storehouse of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s greatest treasures, but added, `` there are, however, some ominous ` cracks' in the storehouse.'' Although <PERSON> Mott </PERSON> did not single out specific threats to the national parks, increasing pressures include commercial and residential development along park boundaries, timbering, oil drilling, and pollution of park resources. Several sessions during the next few days will focus on those threats and ways park superintendents will try to deal with them. <PERSON> Mott </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> must `` reach out to and work with adjacent landowners and land managing agencies to let them know the potential impacts of their actions on park resources. ... We must reach out into the surrounding communities ... and work with government agencies and the private sector to resolve problems before they reach crisis stage. `` That is our challenge as we move into the 21st century,'' said <PERSON> Mott </PERSON>. In a morning news conference, Rep. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vento </PERSON>, D-Minn., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Subcommiteee </ORGANIZATION> on <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lands </ORGANIZATION>, advocated reorganization of the park service to give its director a more independent role <PERSON> Vento </PERSON> has introduced a bill calling for presidential appointment of the director and confirmation by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for a fixed term. <PERSON> Vento </PERSON> said such a move would `` free the director to be an advocate'' and remove him from the political arena. The meeting comes on the brink of summer, as many national parks and recreation areas gear up for record crowds. It is also the latest chapter in the continuing controversy over the nation's officially preserved natural heritage `` This is not a regional or headquarters agenda, this conference is by and for the superintendents,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Berklacy </PERSON>, chief of public affairs for the park service. `` I think it is a very serious, professional thing that they have done'' in holding the conference, said <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Destry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based non-profit citizens group. `` I think it's very important that the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> enhance the notion that this is a single service, with a single purpose,'' said <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON>, who planned to attend the meeting as an observer. `` I'm sure they will get a lot of business done that would not occur if they were n't together.'' `` It is in the best interest of the country,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, adding that the superintendents `` should n't wait another decade for another one.'' The National Park system includes 49 full-fledged national parks and 292 other units, including national recreation areas and national seashore areas, encompassing 77 million acres. Last week, the <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> issued a report calling on the federal government to move all hotels and other concessions out of the parks. The report also identified what the environmental organization deemed were the 10 most endangered parks, among them <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> also recently issued a report, compiled during three years, that recommended a $ 50 million annual increase in the park service's budget just to fix a backlog of resource management problems. The Park Service itself issued a 1980 report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on the `` State of the Parks'' that identified more than 4,000 individual threats. A recent <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> survey concluded that the agency had an unmet need of $ 1.9 billion for maintenance and capital improvements in the 1987 fiscal year. `` Because of advanced, continuing deterioration, some of these assets may be lost permanently,'' the study said. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has proposed a <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> budget of $ 779 million for the next fiscal year. One conference session deals solely with the federal budget process and the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The tab for the meeting is estimated at $ 600,000, said <PERSON> Berklacy </PERSON>. He noted that this year's regional and zone superintendents' meetings, which cost about $ 300,000 in all, have been canceled

 AIDS activist <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> marched into the governor's office and offered a handful of condoms to the receptionist. `` I'd like to give these to the governor. It's the only thing we've been offered for safety in six years,'' said <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> resident who was among those calling for more action against AIDS. There is growing frustration in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> among the medical community, victims' advocacy groups and AIDS patients over government efforts they say are fractured, adrift in a leadership vacuum and hampered by the governor's conservativism. Against that background, supporters of political extremist <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> have for the second time placed an AIDS initiative on the statewide ballot that would allow medical authorities to quarantine victims of acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Voters will decide the issue, Proposition 69, on June 7. The first such measure was rejected overwhelmingly two years ago. Critics accuse Republican Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> of worrying more about offending conservative voters than saving homosexuals and intravenous drug users who are hit hardest by AIDS. <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> boasts of increasing AIDS spending, up to $ 65 million this fiscal year from $ 3.4 million four years ago and almost 50 percent more than the next four states with high AIDS caseloads combined. He has included $ 75 million in AIDS funds in his 1988-89 budget proposal. A <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> study put <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s AIDS allocation for the 1987-88 fiscal year at $ 58 million, lower than the governor's figure but far higher than <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s appropriation of $ 16.4 million. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> was next at $ 12.5 million, followed by <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> at $ 7 million, according to the study. `` In the coming year, our state will continue its leadership in the fight against this deadly disease,'' he said recently. The 13,106 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> cases reported to the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> make up 21.5 percent of the national caseload, second in the nation to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s 15,729, or 25.8 percent. The state Office of AIDS said 58 percent of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> victims, or 7,744 people, had died by April 30. <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> opposes Proposition 69, but critics say he is silent too often on AIDS issues, allowing state policies to be determined by politics rather than public health considerations. The state has clamped down on graphic AIDS educational material in the wake of protests by conservative organizations that the material teaches promiscuity and homosexual sex. `` You have to make sure you do not offend people who are, in essence, paying the bill,'' <PERSON> Thelma </PERSON> <PERSON> Fraziear </PERSON>, chief of the state Office of AIDS, said. Groups professing traditional family values argue that condoms are n't 100 percent effective and that abstinence should be promoted as the best means of AIDS prevention. The <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> supports the use of explicit language to reach some audiences. But the state <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> censured the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> AIDS Foundation for educational literature that <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leaders considered obscene. <PERSON> Fraziear </PERSON> said AIDS, by its nature, is fraught with politics. `` We are dealing with subjects that are not generally discussed in mixed company. ... You get a lot of built-in fears that you do n't get with other programs,'' she said She characterized the state as balancing opposing interests and insisted politics have n't interfered with the mission of education, testing and research. But with health care for AIDS victims alone costing an estimated $ 1 billion, and with the epidemic expected to strike 35,000 more Californians by 1991, AIDS experts say the state is n't doing nearly enough. <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hadden </PERSON>, an assistant to state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberti </PERSON> and a recognized AIDS expert in the Capitol, said the state's low profile forces county health officers and volunteer groups to take the lead. `` To put it bluntly, I wish we could get rid of the state Office of AIDS and put the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> of AIDS in charge,'' <PERSON> Hadden </PERSON> said. `` I think they're much more aggressive.''

 Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> paid tribute to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Wednesday for retracting his characterization of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as an `` evil empire,'' but he blamed the American side for the failure to make more tangible progress at the fourth superpower summit in 30 months. In the first nationally televised <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> news conference by a <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> hailed the continuing U.S.-Soviet dialogue and said `` it is vitally necessary'' that his meetings resume after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s successor takes office in January. In a good-natured, wide-ranging session with Soviet and foreign reporters, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief held forth for nearly two hours, alternately praising the tone of U.S.-Soviet dialogue while criticizing specific <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> positions. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> noted that `` within the walls of the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, next to the Czar's gun, right in the heart of the evil empire,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had responded, `` No,'' when asked if the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> still deserved the appellation he gave it in March 1983. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> explained Tuesday that his characterization, one of the most-quoted of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s presidency, was made in `` another time, another era.'' `` We take note of this,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said, drawing on an ancient <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> saying to add, `` Everything flows, everything changes.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said his meetings with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> were `` in-depth and at times intense discussions right up to the last minutes.'' He described the talks as respectful and productive, but indicated emotions ran high at times, saying he and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> were `` standing up at the table'' to make their points. `` I think that the meetings once again demonstrated the fact that we are indulging in realistic dialogue,'' the 57-year-old Soviet leader said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said he believed a treaty cutting strategic nuclear weapons by 30 percent to 50 percent was still possible this year, despite the failure to break the logjam that has blocked progress toward an agreement since the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> summit last December. Asked if he expected to meet <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> again before the president leaves office, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said it was unlikely unless there is an unforeseen breakthrough in the strategic arms talks. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> rejected several Soviet proposals for inclusion in a 24-page joint statement issued on conclusion of the talks. Both sides agreed there should be no war between them, yet the Americans objected to describing their goal as `` peaceful coexistence,'' or even `` coexistence,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s remarks were contained in a 50-minute opening statement followed by a question-and-answer session that ran about an hour with questioners picked by <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> from a show of hands of some 300 Soviet and foreign journalists. The general secretary reiterated his criticism of ousted <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> party boss <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, a one-time protege, and dismissed <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s suggestion that the Kremlin's No. 2 man, <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, should resign. Last October, at a closed meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> criticized the slow pace of perestroika, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s campaign to modernize the Soviet economy and society, and offered to resign <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said Wednesday that his one-time protege, who had risen to non-voting membership on the ruling Politburo, was overruled by fellow members of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. He said he had not seen <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s recent comments in interviews with Western television networks but would `` demand from Comrade <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> explanations as to what it is all about and what he is after.'' As for <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> and reports he was being pushed from power, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said `` no such problem exists'' with the man widely perceived as the leader of a conservative faction opposing <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in the Politburo. `` Perestroika will win out,'' he said of speculation that the reform movement could be in trouble. He also said he had heard no alternative to his reforms and concluded, `` There can be some maneuvers ... but we have undertaken irreversible change.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, sitting at a table with key members of his summit negotiating team, dominated the session with a self-confident air. Speaking off the cuff much of the time, he made his points gesturing with his hands and flashing a smile. At one point, when he realized that some American correspondents could n't understand because their translation devices were n't functioning, he directed a good-natured reorganization of the seating, telling Soviet reporters to take chairs where the earphones were n't working Many reporters, including <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> anchor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON>, whom <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> singled out by name, stood up and switched seats in the just-renovated auditorium in the Soviet Foreign Ministry press center. The party chief indicated that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had made a recent breakthrough in long-stalled conventional arms talks in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> but accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of `` incomprehensible maneuvers'' that scuttled any mention of that in the closing communique. Asked about the prospects for a fifth summit, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said, `` I like the possibility for a meeting with just one problem, if we have an opportunity to achieve a treaty concerning offensive arms.'' He said the president's <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION> was one sure obstacle, along with a dispute over limits on submarine-launched cruise missiles. Later he said he told <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> the president's view that the so-called Star Wars program is strictly defensive was `` just not serious.'' Asked about the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said for the first time that as soon as an international conference on the region is convened, `` we are prepared to address ourselves to regularizing relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' severed in 1967. He cited the <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> agreement as an example of what could be achieved if the superpowers worked together with warring parties to solve the conflicts, but noted that if Soviet forces now come under attack from rebels as they withdraw, `` we shall react accordingly and appropriately.'' On human rights, he said that when <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` tried to persuade me to change my mind, I said, ` Your explanations are not convincing ... I am not filled with admiration at this aspect of the visit.''' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> met with a group of dissidents and refuseniks during his five-day visit here but scrapped a plan to visit a family of would-be Jewish emigrants. Sources said the Soviets warned <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials the family would never be permitted to leave the country if the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> followed through with their plan. After talking of what he called the contrary attitude of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on some issues, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> singled out economic relations. `` Authoritative parts of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> business circles would like to do business,'' he said. `` They are faced with intimidation and all sorts of restrictions.'' He cited the Jackson-Vanik Amendment which links trade opportunities to emigration freedoms and said he told the president: `` Why should the dead drag on the coattails of the living? ... The amendment was passed in totally different circumstances a decade ago. We should base our policies on present-day realities.'' As he has before, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> described the agreement to eliminate intermediate range -LRB- INF -RRB- nuclear weapons as `` a watershed political event in the Soviet-American dialogue.'' Earlier, in remarks at the exchange of final INF papers, the Soviet leader summarized the proceedings as `` big politics ... worthy of new times.'' `` The era of nuclear disarmament has begun,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. In his news conference statement, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was sharply critical of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stand on reducing the non-nuclear forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact. He said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had rejected a Soviet proposal to exchange data on the troops as a first step toward a massive reduction, but `` the other side immediately tried to dodge the issue.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> engaged in `` incomprehensible maneuvers'' and `` we missed a chance to take an important step forward to a civil relationship.''

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> reported progress Wednesday over two obstacles to a strategic arms deal, but ended their fourth summit divided over the main impediment, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Star Wars program. `` I would hope that before the year is out that we could eliminate the differences that still exist,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. But there seemed little prospect for any imminent breakthrough. After four days of intense talks, the two leaders ordered their negotiators to return to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on July 12 to work on a proposed treaty to cut superpower nuclear arsenals by 30 percent to 50 percent. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told reporters `` it is still possible to sign an agreement in this administration.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` Conversations are still going on and they are still being discussed and I say progress is still being made or we would n't be talking as we are.'' In a 24-page joint statement, the two leaders announced `` achievement of substantial additional common ground'' on two of the five major disputed areas on the proposed Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty -LRB- START -RRB-, ways of monitoring mobile missiles and counting nuclear-tipped cruise missiles on warplanes. Besides modest progress on START, the two leaders inched ahead on other arms control issues. They exchanged ratification protocols for the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty -LRB- INF -RRB- to eliminate medium-range nuclear missiles, which was signed at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> summit last December and ratified by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> last Friday and by the Soviet assembly of presidents 17 hours later. During the summit, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also signed two lesser arms control agreements, one requiring advance notifice of ballistic missile tests and another to tighten verification procedures for a 1974 treaty limiting nuclear tests to 150 kilotons. On the START treaties, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said they had restated opposition to deployment of Soviet SS-24 and SS-25 missiles. `` It is the position of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that such missiles should be banned unless the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> can reach agreement on provisions which provide for effective verification and strict numerical limits on the number of nuclear weapons carried by such missiles,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, in a briefing paper given to reporters, said that acceptable verification rules would require, among other things, restricting mobile missiles to specific geographical areas, means to assure that spy satellites can keep tabs on all such weapons, and the right to inspect sites to investigate suspected violations. The two sides remained far apart on Star Wars and how to negotiate reductions in conventional armies. `` We have missed a chance to take an important step forward,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told reporters. The <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader, who has used all four meetings with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as forums to air his opposition to <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION>, said he had proposed resolving the problem by exchanging data allowing mutual inspection of facilities where technology for an anti-missile defense is tested. But no strategic arms treaty is possible, he said, without an agreement assuring that development and deployment of strategic defenses does not violate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. And a fifth summit would not be possible without a START deal, he said. On the opening day of the talks, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet officials said, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> suggested to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> that they exchange data on conventional arms as a means of making drastic cuts, as proposed by the Russians in 1986. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say they will not directly negotiate conventional cuts with the Soviets, because the matter must be agreed upon by the 33 nations taking part in the Conference on Security and Cooperation in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Those talks also include discussion of alleged Soviet violations of human rights provisions of the original conference accord, signed in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> in 1975.

 A Bedouin couple invoked the honor of their desert tribe in demanding the death of an unwanted son-in-law, a prosecutor said today as the two went on trial of charges of soliciting murder. <PERSON> Suad </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ghada </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarawneh </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, are accused of plotting to kill their daughter's husband and his family and asking that photos and body parts be sent back as proof their honor had been restored. No one was hurt. Assistant State Attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dimitrouleas </PERSON> today quoted from secretly taped conversations he said showed the plot was serious. `` ` In <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, he would be bones in the dirt,'' he quoted <PERSON> Tarawneh </PERSON> as saying of his son-in-law. `` ` If he continues to live, he will destroy my life.''' Police said <PERSON> Tarawneh </PERSON>, 46, had hired a detective to kill his son-in-law, <PERSON> Mouataz </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdulsalam </PERSON>, his younger sister and his mother, Mrs. <PERSON> Tawaneh </PERSON>'s sister.

<HEAD>Leading Indicators Advance Another 0.2 Percent in April</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government said Wednesday its chief economic forecasting gauge rose a modest 0.2 percent in April, an increase analysts said signaled continued healthy economic growth for the rest of this presidential election year. It marked the third consecutive monthly increase in the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Index of Leading Indicators, following an identical 0.2 percent rise in March and a giant 1.5 percent February surge, which had been the largest gain in more than two years. In other good news for the economy, the government reported that orders to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories for manufactured goods shot up 1.2 percent in April to a seasonally adjusted $ 218.7 billion following an even bigger 1.6 percent March increase, indicating that industrial production will be increasing during the months ahead. In a third report, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said construction spending rose 0.1 percent in April to an annual rate of $ 401.8 billion as a big increase in investment on new factories helped offset a decline in government construction projects. Analysts discounted the drop in the volatile government sector and focused instead on the strength in factory construction, which pushed this category up a remarkable 39.1 percent higher than it was a year ago. They said this reflected a rush by businesses to expand operating plants to meet the heavy demand for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports. `` All of the reports today spell nothing but good news for the economy in this election year,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` By and large, we have got a strong expansion in industrial <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> with the orders suggesting increased production, more jobs and good income generation.'' Economists have been busy in recent days boosting their growth forecasts for 1988, based on the report last week that the overall economy, as measured by the gross national product, expanded at a robust 3.9 percent rate in the first three months of the year. This was far better performance than had been forecast immediately after Oct. 19, when the record plunge in stock prices raised fears of an imminent recession. Instead, growth has raced ahead, pushing unemployment down to a 14-year low of 5.4 percent in April. `` It has been an amazing year,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, chief financial economist at <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` The ability of the economy to ignore the stock market crash has really surprised us.'' <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> said his company now was predicting the GNP would grow 3.2 percent this year, which would be the best economic performance since a 6.8 percent surge in 1984. In each of the last two years, GNP growth has been a more modest 2.9 percent. All of this should be good news for Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who hopes his presidential campaign will benefit from a feeling among voters that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has done a good job managing the economy. The March increase in the leading index originally was reported as a much stronger 0.8 percent rise. However, weakness in consumer and business borrowing pulled the index down sharply. But analysts said they were not concerned about the big downward revision, which had been expected. They said if the trend toward smaller monthly increases in the leading index continues, it might be signaling slower growth by the end of 1988 or in early 1989, but any such slowdown probably would not be evident until after the Nov. 8 election. Many economists still believe that while 1988 will be a good year, the country is likely to enter a recession sometime in 1989, brought on by rising interest rates and higher inflation. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> already has made three moves in the past 2 -LCB- months to tighten credit conditions in an effort to dampen inflationary pressures. Lawrence A. <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, deputy chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, blamed the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> actions for the slower increases in the leading index in the past two months and said the situation is similar to mid-1984 when <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> credit-tightening brought on a period of sluggish growth before the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> relented and started easing credit. `` Let us hope the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> backs off again,'' he said. `` If it does, the prospects for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy remain basically sound.'' The 0.2 percent April rise in the leading index reflected increases in five individual indicators and declines in four others. The biggest source of strength was rise in the length of the average workweek, followed by gains in the money supply, a drop in initial unemployment claims, a rise in raw materials prices and an increase in plant and equipment orders. The biggest negative factor was a speed-up in delivery times for business orders, which is viewed as indicating weaker demand. Other negative forces were a decline in stock prices, a drop in building permits and a drop in orders for consumer goods. The various changes left the index at 192.2 percent of its 1967 base of 100.

<HEAD>Sinhalese Extremists Burn Buildings, Kill Policeman To Disrupt

 Sinhalese extremists on Wednesday burned more than 15 government buildings, stabbed a policeman to death and injured eight people with a bomb in attacks aimed at stopping provincial elections. The government responded by ordering police and security forces to shoot on sight anyone caught destroying government property. The elections are scheduled for Thursday to comply with a provision of a peace accord aimed at ending the minority Tamils' five-year insurgency Extremists among the majority Sinhalese say the pact made too many concessions to the Tamils and have vowed to kill anyone who supports it. Government officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said explosions and fire also damaged three trains bound for <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> on Wednesday. One of the trains was stopped by three gun-wielding youths in <LOCATION> Nebomob </LOCATION>, 20 miles north of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, said the officials and travelers. The youths, believed to be Sinhalese extremists, ordered passengers off the train and then set two of the coaches ablaze with gasoline. No injuries were reported. The policeman was stabbed by three Sinhalese in the southern town of <LOCATION> Galle </LOCATION>, said a police spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said one Sinhalese extremist was shot to death in an encounter with police north of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> and a second died when a firebomb he was going to throw at a government building just south of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> blew up in his hand. In another attack, four government officials and four policemen were seriously injured when a bomb went off in <LOCATION> Nuwara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eilya </LOCATION>'s town hall 60 miles east of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> as poll workers prepared for Thursday's voting. Police blamed the attack on the nationalist <ORGANIZATION> Sinhalese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. The front told people in the election area to stay inside for 36 hours and put up posters threatening to kill anyone who tried to vote. The police spokesman said more than 15 government buildings were set ablaze by the Sinhalese extremists, mostly in western and southern districts. The buildings included post offices, development offices and town halls, he said. Businessmen said extremists ordered them to shutter their shops, and many merchants said they complied for fear of reprisal. Some of the shops opened later in the day. Government announcements on state-run radio and television said police `` have been given orders to shoot on sight any person engaged in the destruction of public property'' and said the elections would go ahead. The voting Thursday is to elect new district councils in the western and central provinces. The capital at <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> in the western province. More than 3.6 million voters are eligible to vote in the elections to choose 158 representatives. The balloting was called for in the peace accord signed on July 29, 1987 by Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and Sri Lankan President <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON>. The signing led to rioting in which several hundred people were killed or injured. The government blamed the Sinhalese front for instigating the riots. The violence on Wednesday was the worst since those riots. The front has been blamed for the deaths of more than 300 people since the pact was signed, many of them government officials or members of <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON>'s governing <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Several candidates were killed before district council elections April 28 in four other regions. Tamil rebels have been waging a guerrilla war since 1983 for more political autonomy or an independent homeland in northern and eastern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. Tamils, who are mostly Hindus and make up 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million population, say they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese, who control the government and military. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has become involved because it is the dominant regional power and because its 60 million ethnic Tamils are sympathetic to the Sri Lankan cause. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has sent more than 50,000 troops to the island to enforce the accord, but they are posted in the north and east to deal with Tamil problems. The Sinhalese front was outlawed after an abortive attempt in 1971 to overthrow the Sri Lankan government. It has been regrouping in recent years and has been blamed for a series of violent acts, including the attempted assassination of <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> in August 1987.

 <LOCATION> MOSCOW </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- -RRB- _ <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> raised the possibility Wednesday that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> might relax trade restrictions on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, as <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> complained that such restrictions did not reflect `` present-day realities.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> blasted the Jackson-Vanik amendment, in which <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> denied certain <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade benefits to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as long as the Soviets restrict emigration by Jews and others. `` Why should the dead drag on the coattails of the living?'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> asked, referring to Jackson-Vanik. `` One is physically dead, the other is politically dead,'' he said. The measure is named for its chief sponsors, the late Sen. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, D-Wash., and former Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanik </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had complained to him about congressional restrictions on trade at the dinner party President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> hosted Tuesday night <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told him at the dinner he was `` a little frustrated'' by adoption in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of resolutions condemning the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. `` He indicated it made his job that much more difficult,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. `` Authoritative parts of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> business circles would like to do business,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` They are faced with intimidation and all sorts of restrictions ... We should base our policies on present-day realities.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> did not hold out much hope that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would relax trade restrictions this year, but said: `` I think if this relationship continues to grow, there are always possibilities that changes will be made.'' At <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s invitation, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> spent 24 hours in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> where they came to watch the ceremonial exchange of the ratified <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate-Range </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> treaty eliminating a class of weapons. The senators said changes in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> paved the way for better cooperation between the superpowers, but they were pessimistic that a treaty cutting long-range nuclear weapons could be negotiated, or ratified by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, this year. But the two senators called for other initiatives, such as the parliamentary exchanges mentioned by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said he was pleased that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> recently agreed to allow the mass distribution of Bibles in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` I have written to the general secretary commending him on taking this step and urging that there be an expansion of this effort,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> also proposed that the superpowers agree to cooperate in the war against illicit drugs. `` Instead of the suggested joint mission ... to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>, we could work jointly on the war on drugs,'' he said. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, whose right arm is crippled because of a war injury, said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> should pledge their support for the rights of the disabled. Saluting <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for his part in producing the accord, <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said, `` I do n't think anyone else could have done that. He came along at the right moment.'' Said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>: `` <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has come a long way since 1981.'' He said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was in a unique position to negotiate with the Soviets because of his `` conservative credentials.''

 The following are excerpts from Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s news conference on Wednesday: -LRB- The general secretary's remarks through an interpreter. -RRB- GORBACHEV: We have completed the fourth meeting, fourth in three years between the general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> CPSU </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> -RRB- and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> president, and this alone is not simply a matter of arithmetic. I would say that this is of great political import to have four meetings in just three years. It signifies the intensity of the political dialogue, and it shows the character, the level of our relations, and I guess this in itself is meaningful. ... The meeting did indeed show how important is the dialogue between the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and it has confirmed yet again how right we were in choosing the path we took in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> two and a half years ago. To <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, that path has led us to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. ... Everybody is interested in Soviet-American relations being switched on to a normal and healthy track. ... And so, I ask, why has this become possible, this intense dialogue, this process, which is of immense importance? I think it is due to realism. I'm speaking about realism in politics, in the policies of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> because it is a realistic approach, on the one side, that has ensured the possibility of this process. ... The relations, which bore within them a terrible threat to the very existence of mankind and to peace, became more positive and acquired positive dynamism. The two most powerful nations began to reform their relationship in their own interest and in the interest of the world community at large. ... The major result is a continuation of dialogue, which now encompasses all of the key issues of world politics, of bilateral relations. This meeting, once again, demonstrated the fact that we are indulging in a realistic dialogue. ... Also characteristic, and this you will find in the final document ... the concept that in this dialogue of ours ... we are laying down prerequisites, the bricks, so to say, for the building of our future relationship. It is a sign of movement into the 21st century. Now, what have we achieved specifically? I would mention the fact that we have completed the process concerning medium - and shorter-range missiles, and this fourth meeting gave an added impetus to the process and we exchanged instruments of ratification This is not simply a formality, and let me just use a solemn formula ... that completion of the procedures and introduction into force of the INF -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate-Range </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- treaty has turned the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> meeting into a watershed political event in the Soviet-American dialogue and in world politics as a whole. It is not only the peoples of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that can congratulate themselves, but also their allies and the entire world public, the entire world community. It is a common victory for reason and realism. And it has become possible because today, on all continents, in every nation, in every country, regardless of social choice and of other values, which each people chooses for itself, there is a common understanding and awareness that the world had reached the brink and that it had to be stopped, that event had to be stopped and the door had to be opened leading in another direction towards a nuclear free and non-violent world and towards making international relations more healthy. Many made their real and substantial contribution to achieving this major victory. And I must note these facts and also mention the contribution of the press, even when the press posed the most difficult questions before the negotiations, that, too, was a necessary contribution that helped to make the dialogue more concrete, more convincing in finding solutions, finding new arguments in elaborating the forms of verification and control. ... The president and I ... have approved a joint statement. It summarizes what _ the advances made since <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and what has been achieved here in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. At the same time, this statement confirms a sort of agenda for the Soviet-American dialogue for the future. It is, in short, an important political document which hallmarks a whole phase in our relations. The most important points in it are those clauses which relate to the importance of building up political dialogue between the nations, intensifying the talks and negotiations and then I would mention further _ I would note progress made in the sphere of disarmament. This is a very difficult process, especially if you take the question of strategic offensive arms. It's not an easy dialogue. ... I must state very firmly that step-by-step we are moving toward a treaty on strategic offensive arms. ... I will say that if we effectively conduct our business, and if the present administration _ and of course, this applies to both countries _ if we act effectively, using all of our possibilities and opportunities, we can achieve a treaty. ...

 Battery Thomson, nestled on the shores of <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s Island flanking <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> harbor, was built years ago for a German attack that never came. But on recent evenings, the World War I-era cement and stone bunker has become the torch-lighted stage for portraying a much older conflict: `` Wat Tyler,'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sewell </PERSON>'s dramatic account of a peasant revolt in 14th century <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. Running Horse Productions of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> is staging the premiere of the play as part of <LOCATION> Piccolo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Spoleto </LOCATION>, a companion festival to <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>'s Spoleto Festival U.S.A. The production deals with the 1381 uprising in which <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> marched with an army of 10,000 serfs to confront King <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, then 14. <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiedergott </PERSON>, who recently did a pilot for a new CBS-TV series called `` Limited Partners,'' plays the role of <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Winley </PERSON> is <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>, an itinerant priest who inspired <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Horvitz </PERSON>, who recently appeared in the movie `` Summer School,'' plays the king. Of the 20 cast members, 12 are from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and eight from <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>. The actors are volunteering their time for the production. `` We're doing a $ 50,000 show for $ 18,000,'' said <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> LeGrande </PERSON>, one of the co-producers. `` It would cost $ 75,000 in <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION>'' Cast members helped build risers for seating, helped assemble scaffolding for light towers and spent hours in the hot sun clearing a battery of weeds and broken glass. The audience is escorted through a cave-like door of the bunker and through a hallway lined with candles. On the other side with underbrush lining the battery, the scene takes on the aura of a medieval castle. Before being taken over by the production, the battery was a hangout for youths who live on the island where master of the macabre <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Poe </PERSON> wrote `` <PERSON> Annabel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'' and `` The Gold Bug.'' Locals on the island of weathered beach houses have opened their doors to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> cast. `` We've been getting a lot of attention because it's an unusual project as a whole,'' <PERSON> LeGrande </PERSON> said. Local merchants have donated food, neighbors have put up relatives of cast members while 13 actors are living in a beach house provided by a resident. For <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> MacHugh </PERSON>, who has appeared in a number of TV series and has the part of <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Straw </PERSON> in the play, the production is a chance to perform away from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` It's a new piece without the <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION> environment,'' he said. `` We get to work with something untouched, and we get <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s Island too.''

 Construction spending advanced 0.1 percent in April as a boom in factory construction helped offset weakness in government projects, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday. The department said building activity rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 401.8 billion in April, up 1.4 percent from a year ago. The April advance followed a big 1.3 percent jump in March and a 0.4 percent February increase. But analysts tended to discount the weak overall change and instead focus on a big 8.8 percent rise in spending on industrial plants, which put activity in this sector up a remarkable 39.8 percent above where it was a year ago. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jasinowski </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION>, said the gain reflected the boom in export sales, which has meant plants in many industries are operating near full capacity. `` Industry was trying to cut costs in 1982 and 1983 by slashing capacity and closing down plants,'' he said. `` The growth in construction is a reflection of increased international demand running against a production supply that had been cut back too much in previous years.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said that while the construction figures so far this year have been strong, he expected weakness in the months ahead in both residential and non-residential building because of the recent increases in interest rates. Government construction, after soaring 5 percent in March, fell by 3.1 percent in April to an annual rate of $ 79.3 billion. But analysts said this swing in a volatile category was not worrisome and they predicted further gains in the months ahead based on increased federal money for highway projects which <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approved last year over President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto. Residential construction posted a 0.4 percent advance in April to an annual rate of $ 191.9 billion. This reflected a 0.8 percent increase in construction of single-family homes and a 1.4 percent drop in apartment construction. Apartment building is now 22.2 percent below the level of a year ago as this sector continues to be hurt by changes in the tax law and high vacancy rates. Non-residential construction climbed 2.1 percent in April to an annual rate of $ 94.4 billion. In addition to the big 8.8 percent advance in industrial construction, office construction posted a 1.1 percent increase while construction of shopping centers and other commercial buildings rose 2.9 percent.

 Traffic scofflaws are getting relief _ not from the fines but from lines at court. Three <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Money </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> soon will accept fine payments in a program that will help clear 36th <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which processed more than 400,000 traffic violations last year, Chief Judge <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shakoor </PERSON> said. The Money Stores, owned by <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION>'s only minority-owned bank, will get a 50-cent fee from each ticket. Traffic violations can be paid by mail, but people too poor to maintain bank accounts are unable do so because fines must be paid with a check or money order. Thirty percent are paid in person, <PERSON> Shakoor </PERSON> said. `` The 36th District Court is a people's court, and we intend to provide more community-oriented services that will ultimately make the court run more smoothly,'' <PERSON> Shakoor </PERSON> said. Beginning June 13, motorists can pay fines on all traffic violations. The program may be expanded for parking violations. First Independence, which opened the <ORGANIZATION> Money </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> more than a year ago to provide banking services to lower-income <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> residents, lost $ 500,000 on the stores last year and expects to lose $ 230,000 this year. The fees collected from the fine payments will help, said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, chairman of First Independence. The Money Stores were chosen for the program because the facilities have computer systems that are compatible with the court's, <PERSON> Shakoor </PERSON> said, adding officials eventually hope to make the service available at other banking institutions. <PERSON> Shakoor </PERSON> said he knew of no other program like <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s in the country.

 Tape, sheer fabric and grease are no longer enough between topless dancers and their audience. City Council has amended a pornography ordinance that previously specified what body parts had to be covered but not that the covering had to be opaque. The council changed that on Tuesday. Some women `` were covering their breasts with Vaseline or grease, because the ordinance did not say what type of covering was needed,'' said <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>, assistant city attorney. There also were reports that women used see-through fabric or clear tape to skirt the ordinance. <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> is trying to stamp out adult businesses, said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>, a lawyer who represents some of the businesses. `` If you comply with the first ordinance they pass, they change it to make sure no one can comply,'' he said. The amendment takes effect immediately, and anyone violating it is subject to arrest. Strip shows are allowed by law, but the adult entertainment business has to be at least 1,000 feet from homes, schools, churches, parks or other adult establishments.

 Parking cashiers at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> skimmed as much as $ 2 million from customers' parking fees by substituting low-value tickets for higher-priced ones, court documents said. The cashiers obtained bogus parking tickets by rolling shopping carts over sensors and then traded $ 2 stubs for those turned in by customers who paid up to $ 100, according to documents unsealed Tuesday. The cashiers pocketed up to $ 250 an hour, police said in affidavits seeking search warrants. More than 30 employees of <ORGANIZATION> Parking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Concepts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which operates the 25,000-space airport parking concession, were indicted May 19 on charges of embezzling city funds. Officials estimated that as much as $ 2 million had been skimmed. According to the documents, new applicants for parking cashier positions were forced to pay up to $ 3,000 to gain the $ 7-an-hour jobs, but were assured by managers that they could make that money back through the alleged embezzlement scheme. Twenty-three defendants pleaded innocent to embezzlement charges Tuesday; preliminary hearings were scheduled for June and July. Three others were arraigned last week; two were to enter pleas June 7. Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Berman </PERSON> declined comment on the status of the remaining defendants.

 They're alive and well, but children who undergo kidney transplants are also extremely short because the medication they take to ensure the transplant is n't rejected hinders their growth, doctors say. Since young kidney recipients want to grow normally, doctors are trying new therapies, with some success, to help them in body and spirit. `` They're taller and they're much happier,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Amir </PERSON> <PERSON> Tejani </PERSON>, director of renal services at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>. About one-fourth of all young kidney recipients can be treated successfully without a steroid commonly combined with the potent anti-rejection drug cyclosporine, <PERSON> Tejani </PERSON> reported Tuesday at the annual conference of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transplant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physicians </ORGANIZATION>. The steroid, known as prednisone, inhibits the growth plate in the bone from functioning normally. It also causes acne and puffiness, most noticeably in the face. `` This is a very important study since the whole point of doing transplants is to achieve growth,'' said Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON>, a nephrologist at <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` Even for a third of them to grow normally, then by all means we should be doing this for our kids or at least trying,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunsicker </PERSON>, the society's president. Like children suffering from other serious illnesses, children with kidney failure tend to be extraordinarily short, sometimes barely topping 4 feet. By the time they undergo a transplant, it's often too late for these children to catch up on past growth. Even if they receive transplants at a very young age, the medication necessary for helping to prevent their bodies' immune systems from attacking the new organ stunts their growth. Perhaps the best-known case involves <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, star of the former television series `` Diff ` rent Strokes The 19-year-old actor, who's undergone two kidney transplants, is under 5 feet tall. `` The issue is a big one'' for these children, said Dr. <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Greifer </PERSON>, medical director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kidney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. `` A lot of the patients, especially the younger ones, want to take the risk -LRB- of rejection -RRB- for the extra inches.'' Some patients, in fact, cheat on their medication in a desperate attempt to improve their appearance, according to <PERSON> Tejani </PERSON>. `` You ca n't tell them it does n't matter -LRB- if they're short -RRB- when it matters to them,'' <PERSON> Greifer </PERSON> said. `` You ca n't tell them the world is made up of small people when Americans are getting taller.'' About 1,200 youngsters 16 and under experience kidney failure every year in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Greifer </PERSON>. Six hundred to 800 of them eventually receive new kidneys; they comprise fewer than 9 percent of the total number of kidney transplants performed annually. The operation is quite successful. One year after transplantation, up to 85 percent of them still have properly functioning kidneys, according to experts. For his research, <PERSON> Tejani </PERSON> studied 53 children and selected 30 whose transplanted kidneys were functioning well enough to undergo the experiment. The 30 were taken off prednisone. Twenty-three of them proved to be treatable solely with cyclosporine at the time. However, nine of the 23 had to return to prednisone later, after experiencing mild episodes of organ rejection, <PERSON> Tejani </PERSON> said. The remaining 14 _ a little more than one-fourth of the original 53 children in the study _ have been off prednisone for up to 4 -LCB- years without any episodes of organ rejection or side effects, according to <PERSON> Tejani </PERSON>. More important, all of them have grown, including one 17-year-old boy who has reached 5 feet, 8 inches. In patients unable to be weaned off prednisone, <PERSON> Tejani </PERSON> has administered growth hormone, enabling them to catch up on some of their lost growth. Doctors at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> also have begun giving growth hormone to certain kidney transplant patients as well as children on dialysis. `` The data seems good,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Vera </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, a clinical fellow at <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION>. `` There seems to be hope.''

 <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s right-wing rebels claimed Wednesday their guerrilla forces attacked an major Mozambican army base, tore up railway tracks and killed 28 people, including a British military instructor.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> reported progress Wednesday over two obstacles to a strategic arms deal, but ended their fourth summit divided over the main impediment, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Star Wars program. `` I would hope that before the year is out that we could eliminate the differences that still exist,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. But there seemed little prospect for any imminent breakthrough. After four days of intense talks, the two leaders ordered their negotiators to return to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on July 12 to work on a proposed treaty to cut superpower nclear arsenals by 30 percent to 50 percent. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told reporters `` it is still possible to sign an agreement in this administration.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` Conversations are still going on and they are still being discussed and I say progress is still being made or we would n't be talking as we are.'' In a 24-page joint statement, the two leaders announced `` achievement of substantial additional common ground'' on two of the five major disputed areas on the proposed Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty -LRB- START -RRB-, ways of monitoring mobile missiles and counting nuclear-tipped cruise missiles on warplanes. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms negotiator <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowny </PERSON> said there was `` a lot of room'' to go in the two areas. And he said `` we didn ` t get anywhere'' on the two biggest obstacles to a treaty: keeping track of submarine-fired cruise missiles and Soviet objections to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Star Wars missile-defense program, formally known as the Strategic Defense Inititiative. Besides modest progress on START, the two leaders inched ahead on other arms control issues. They exchanged ratification protocols for the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty -LRB- INF -RRB- to eliminate medium-range nuclear missiles, which was signed at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> summit last December and ratified by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> last Friday and by the Soviet assembly of presidents 17 hours later. During the summit, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also signed two lesser arms control agreements, one requiring advance notifice of ballistic missile tests and another to tighten verification procedures for a 1974 treaty limiting nuclear tests to 150 kilotons. On the START treaties, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said they had restated opposition to deployment of Soviet SS-24 and SS-25 missiles. `` It is the position of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that such missiles should be banned unless the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> can reach agreement on provisions which provide for effective verification and strict numerical limits on the number of nuclear weapons carried by such missiles,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, in a briefing paper given to reporters, said that acceptable verification rules would require, among other things, restricting mobile missiles to specific geographical areas, means to assure that spy satellites can keep tabs on all such weapons, and the right to inspect sites to investigate suspected violations. The two sides remained far apart on Star Wars and how to negotiate reductions in conventional armies. `` We have missed a chance to take an important step forward,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told reporters. The <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader, who has used all four meetings with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as forums to air his opposition to <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION>, said he had proposed resolving the problem by exchanging data allowing mutual inspection of facilities where technology for an anti-missile defense is tested. But no strategic arms treaty is possible, he said, without an agreement assuring that development and deployment of strategic defenses does not violate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. And a fifth summit would not be possible without a START deal, he said. On the opening day of the talks, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet officials said, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> suggested to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> that they exchange data on conventional arms as a means of making drastic cuts, as proposed by the Russians in 1986. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say they will not directly negotiate conventional cuts with the Soviets, because the matter must be agreed upon by the 33 nations taking part in the Conference on Security and Cooperation in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Those talks also include discussion of alleged Soviet violations of human rights provisions of the original conference accord, signed in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> in 1975.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> moved Wednesday to strip <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizenship from a <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> man accused of being part of an execution squad that murdered unarmed Jews and other civilians for the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> during World War II. <PERSON> Valdis </PERSON> <PERSON> Didrichsons </PERSON> concealed his service in the <ORGANIZATION> Latvian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auxiliary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> in 1941 and 1942 when he entered the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1950 under the Displaced Persons Act, the government alleged in a complaint filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. A native of <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Didrichsons </PERSON> became a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen in August 1956. Assisting in persecution makes a person ineligible to immigrate to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and requires revocation of citizenship. The denaturalization case against <PERSON> Didrichsons </PERSON> is the first step in a process which could lead to deportation.

 Delegates to a special <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> session on disarmament on Wednesday urged the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to ban underground weapons tests and scrap their nuclear arsenals. Speakers began addressing the special session as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> concluded their <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit meeting with an impasse on achieving major cuts in strategic nuclear weapons. But the assembly praised the superpower treaty eliminating intermediate-range nuclear weapons as a breakthrough because it scraps a whole class of nuclear weapons for the first time. Prime Minister <PERSON> Ingvar </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> called for complete nuclear disarmament and said the use of nuclear arms could threaten the survival of civilization. `` One can not reach peace by frightening other countries,'' he said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> could and should have a central role in the sphere of disarmament, and is the most appropriate organization to carry out verification functions on behalf of the international community,'' he said. It can provide unique services, as a repository of data and source of impartial observers and experts, he said. He called for 50 percent cuts in strategic weapons, complete abolition of all tactical nuclear weapons, prevention of a nuclear arms race in outer space, a comprehensive nuclear test ban, the signing the nuclear nonproliferation treaty, and the removal of nuclear weapons from naval vessels. <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON> also condemned the use of chemical weapons in the Iran-Iraq war and said the buildup of anti-personnel lasers also must be stopped. Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the only nation that has been the target of an atomic attack, said his people pray for disarmament. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s constitution prohibits the presence or development of nuclear weapons. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> announced that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> plans to convene an international conference with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to share Japanese technology in seismology to verify nuclear testing. He said it could serve as step toward establishing a global system for verification of nuclear testing. He said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> would increase its assistance to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to prevent conflicts, noting that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> recently contributed $ 20 million to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, including $ 5 million for use in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> where the world body mediated a settlement. The Japanese leader said he was considering the dispatch of personnel for election supervision, transportation, communication and medical services to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> delivered the opening address as chairman of the non-aligned movement. He condemned the superpowers for the nuclear arms race and said military spending should be diverted to development. He said the international community must work toward achieving a nuclear-free world with the help of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and the multilateral Conference on Disarmament. <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> called for a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty _ a measure opposed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ and he opposed the militarization of outer space _ a reference to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space-based missile defense initiative, or `` Star Wars.'' He called for the establishment of nuclear-free zones, including <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. More than 25 heads of state and government will address the 159-member <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in the next two weeks in the third special session on disarmament in 10 years. The world body then will adopt resolutions on disarmament, from nuclear to chemical, and steps to achieve it.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> acknowledged after five days of summit talks Wednesday that they remain divided by `` serious differences'' over efforts to end regional conflicts from <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. Nonetheless, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials held out hope for progress in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, and the two leaders cited the Soviet pullout from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> as an example of what the superpowers can achieve if they work together with warring factions. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> sent a strong signal that Soviet forces withdrawing from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> would return fire if subjected to continuing attacks from Moslem rebels battling the Soviet-backed government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. `` We shall react accordingly and appropriately,'' said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, referring to recent assaults on Soviet troops and the Soviet Embassy in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. `` That should be absolutely clear.'' The Soviets disclosed last week that more than 13,000 of their troops had been killed since they intervened in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979. A senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, speaking on condition he not be identified, said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> raised the issue of attacks on withdrawing troops directly with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> this week. On Saturday, the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> publicly protested continued arms shipments to the Afghan rebels from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, also speaking privately: `` We'll stand by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>.'' Soviet chief of staff Marshal <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON> was reported to have presented a detailed plan for withdrawal of the estimated 115,000 Soviet troops in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, indicating that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> intends to abide by the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement to remove all its forces by Feb. 15. The final communique issued by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said their talks had `` revealed serious differences both in the assessments of the causes of regional tensions and in the means to overcome them.'' The leaders were able to agree only `` that these differences need not be an obstacle to constructive interaction'' on regional conflicts, the statement said. In other developments: _ <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told a televised post-summit news conference that the Soviets are ready to consider restoring diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> once an international conference on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> is convened. But he said several issues yet to be resolved included Palestinian participation in the conference and topics to be discussed. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and all its Eastern bloc allies except <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> severed ties with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1967 over the Six Day War. The Kremlin sent a consular delegation to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> last year, and other East European nations have strengthened their ties with the Jewish state in recent months. _ A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, speaking on condition he not be identified, said summit talks on southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> went well. He said the two sides set a September deadline for completing a complex deal involving withdrawal of 40,000 Cuban troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and reconciliation of that country's Marxist government and U.S.-backed guerrillas. Another potential area of U.S.-Soviet cooperation may involve locating the 311 Soviet troops reported missing in action in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signaled <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> willingness to help, and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said Wednesday that contacts had been made with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Pakistani officials in behalf of the MIAs. On the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said that `` there has been a drawing closer of our positions,'' citing agreement that an international conference is needed. `` We've given the Americans several years of opportunity to go it alone'' in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. `` They saw that they could n't.'' Other conflicts discussed by the two leaders and their delegations included <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the Iran-Iraq war. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has tried to persuade the Soviets to support an arms embargo against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> but <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has hesitated. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leaders want to avoid souring future relations with neighboring <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.

 Animal rights officials are investigating a complaint that a teacher used a shovel to beat an opossum and five of its babies to death. The incident marks the second time in two years a teacher at <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bedford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voc-Tech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> has been investigated for killing an opossum. In May 1986, the executive direcor of the <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION>, sought charges against a chef-instructor at the school for butchering an opossum for a cooking demonstration.

An investigator for the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals went to the school Tuesday after an anonymous complaint, according to <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Torre </PERSON>, director of the law enforcement department for the Boston-based organization. Cruelty to animals is a criminal offense. If the killing is found to be done with malicious intent, the penalty can be up to $ 500 in fines or one year in prison, or both. The investigator retrieved the animals' bodies from a school trash bin. They were mangled and one of the babies had been decapitated, <PERSON> Torre </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON>, superintendent-director at the regional vocational-technical high school, said Tuesday he had heard reports of the incident and was investigating.

 A pro-government newspaper Wednesday published what it claimed was a 2-year-old <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> document calling for the destabilization of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and refusal to turn over the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> in 1999. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> called the publication of the alleged 1986 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> document in the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Critica </ORGANIZATION> `` an obvious and gross falsification'' and `` a continuation of the permanent campaign of propaganda of the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> regime against the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>.'' The paper said the document was `` secret and sensitive'' and that only seven copies were made for distribution at an <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> meeting April 8, 1986. The newspaper said President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took part in the meeting, although the reproduction of the alleged document made no mention of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The reproduction of the document said, `` The basic issue is still to guarantee <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> control over the interoceanic waterway, keeping it free from Soviet influence, after the year 2000.'' It said the Panamanian government might be exposed to <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> and Soviet intervention after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> turns over the canal. `` Reports of corruption among -LRB- some Panamanian officers -RRB- provide an opportunity to launch a campaign to destabilize <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and legitimately abrogate the treaties,'' said the reproduction, which contains several mispellings and typographical errors. The <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaties </ORGANIZATION> returned the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zone </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in 1977 and call for <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to take over the waterway itself at the end of 1999. Since the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> began a dispute about a year ago, Panamanan officials often have accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of planning to back out of the agreement. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is seeking to oust Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who is head of the 15,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and the power behind the civilian government. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was indicted in February by a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on drug smuggling charges.

 Presidential hopeful <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> walked on a garbage-covered beach Wednesday and called on corporations and the federal government to battle pollution more vigorously. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s campaign stop capped five days of seeking votes in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, which has its primary next Tuesday. The biggest delegate prize on that day is <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, though, and the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> contender headed back to that state late Wednesday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, stepping over broken glass, plastic bottles, fast-food containers and a woman's shoe, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> described this one-time popular resort beach along the <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Kill </PERSON> as an example of `` economic and environmental violence.'' `` If the Russians were poisoning our air, if they were dumping sludge in the water, if they were killing fish, we would call that chemical warfare and we would negotiate tough,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. Nearly all the trash on the beach here, including such hospital waste as used syringes and plasma bags, floats across from the Fresh Kills landfill in <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and residents speak harshly of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s disposal practices. But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said corporations and the federal government were most to blame for the pollution. He said that cleaning up the shore and toxic waste dumps would create jobs and protect the public's health `` This idea that it's coming from one state to another is one focus. But in my judgment it's too narrow a focus,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` The federal government has an obligation. We must invest in recycliong plants. We must challenge these corporations and offer them incentives to build these recycling plants.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who lags far behind <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> polls, used his stay in the state to further define what he would want at the party convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. On Wednesday, he said the party needs him if it wants a victory in November and said again he deserves consideration as vice president should he not get the presidential nomination. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, campaigning in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> over the Memorial Day weekend, also called for stepped-up efforts to battle ocean pollution. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, asked how he differed from <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on environmental issues, said the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor's reputation as a good manager is not enough to battle pollution. `` I take the position that we can not just manage these corporations as they exist. Their behavior must change. They must be much more accountable,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. As he walked along the beach, a helicopter from the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> skimmed the water. Local officials said they had never seen one before. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> attributed the helicopter's arrival to `` Action <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>,'' a phrase he urges crowds to chant during rallies, and said the agency has been ineffective against polluters. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Cahill </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the helicopter was part of the agency's routine shore monitoring program and its appearance Wednesday was coincidental.

 Some human rights observers questioned President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s assertion Wednesday that Soviet emigration barriers are the result of bureaucratic bungling, but gave the president high marks overall on his handling of the issue at the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit. `` It's really hard to know where <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was coming from on that,'' said <PERSON> Dawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, a fellow at the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, an independent policy research institute. `` The fact that there still are several hundred prisoners of conscience is not attributable to bureaucratic snafus.'' At his news conference in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said emigration barriers may arise from a Kremlin `` bound in by bureaucracy,'' rather than deliberate Soviet policy. `` I think it's unfortunate ... that the president was not more direct about the real reasons for human rights violations in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Juliana </PERSON> <PERSON> Pilon </PERSON>, a Soviet scholar at the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. `` After all, who is he kidding? ... It just is n't true.'' But a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> congressman who studies human rights issues, Rep. <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> <PERSON> Yatron </PERSON>, D-Pa., dismissed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s comments as stemming from a desire not to criticize his host too harshly while still in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> `` I think it was more protocol'' than timidity on human rights, said <PERSON> Yatron </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Affairs human rights subcommittee. `` I can think of no one in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> or the administration who feels that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s repressive policies are not the results of the repressive nature of a communist government,'' <PERSON> Yatron </PERSON> said. `` I would want to give the president the benefit of the doubt.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s comment, which declined to pin responsibilty for emigration denials directly on Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, really was a skillful diplomatic gesture, said Rep. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, the senior Republican on <PERSON> Yatron </PERSON>'s panel. `` That gives wiggle room for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to react, and without confrontational demands,'' <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> said. `` I'm confident that it will work.'' <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> and others said overall, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had made human rights a far higher priority at this fourth summit meeting than at previous meetings with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, and predicted improvements in Soviet emigration and other human rights areas. `` I thought he was very forceful in his presentation of human rights,'' <PERSON> Yatron </PERSON> said. `` I am cautiously optimistic that the president's aggressive posture will spark more reforms.'' `` We could n't have hoped for more as a human rights organization,'' said <PERSON> Jeri </PERSON> <PERSON> Laber </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> Watch in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` The president has certainly made this an important issue'' by meeting with dissidents in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and making strong statements about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> human rights values. But she said being diplomatic is n't always the best approach when dealing with such an issue of inalienable rights. `` You've got to be vocal and verbal and insistent, even to the point of irritating'' those you are dealing with, said <PERSON> Laber </PERSON>. `` We recognize he has a balancing act to do. Given all of that, he's done a very good job.'' `` Only time will tell,'' said <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>. `` If more people are released in the next several weeks, if there are concrete actions, then we can say <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was right to have been so tactful. There's so much that we do n't know.

 Orders to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories surged for the second consecutive month in April, the government said Wednesday, indicating that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturing plants will be humming in the months ahead. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said orders for durable and non-durable goods rose a strong 1.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted $ 218.7 billion in April. The advance followed an even bigger 1.6 percent increase in March. `` The boom-like conditions in factory <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> continue pretty much unabated,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. There was no change in order levels in February and a modest 0.6 percent drop in January. But that was one of only two declines in the past year. Most economists had been forecasting only modest growth in new orders of 0.5 percent in April. The bigger-than-expected number likely will do little to alleviate concern among some analysts that strong demand, particularly for exports, will trigger greater inflation. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, chief financial economist at <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, forecasting firm, noted the continuing increase in the backlog of unfilled orders, indicating manufacturers have been getting more orders than they can meet. `` This should be good news for production in coming months,'' <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> said. The backlog of $ 418.1 billion was 10.8 percent higher than a year ago. It jumped by 1 percent in April following a smaller increase of 0.4 percent in March. The strength in new orders in April came in electrical machinery, lumber and wood products and in petroleum, chemicals and paper. The department revised its estimate of new orders for durable goods, `` big ticket items'' expected to last three or more years, to $ 116.4 billion, up 1.0 percent. The previous estimate for April, released 10 days ago, was 0.8 percent. The gain in March had been 0.8 percent. Orders for non-durable goods increased 1.5 percent to $ 102.2 billion in April following a 2.5 percent rise a month earlier. Excluding the volatile category of military goods, orders were up 1.2 percent in April, the third consecutive increase and the sixth rise in seven months. Defense goods rose 2.2 percent to $ 10.0 billion in April, following a whopping 14.6 percent rise in March. The key category of non-defense capital goods, considered a barometer of business expansion plans, rose 1.9 percent in April to $ 33.1 billion, following a drop of 3.8 percent. Analysts are looking for businesses to boost capital spending to meet the rising demand abroad for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods, which have become more competitively priced because of the devalued dollar. Orders for electrical machinery climbed 4.2 percent, following a 3.8 percent slide in March. Most of the April strength in that category came from a large 25.4 percent rise in orders for communication equipment, most of them from the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Orders for primary metals such as steel declined 0.3 percent in April, while orders for transportation equipment climbed a slight 0.1 percent and non-electrical machinery fell 0.6 percent. Shipments of manufactured goods were unchanged at $ 214.6 billion in April following a 2.7 percent increase in March.

 A tentative settlement reached in a sex discrimination case against a citrus grower calls for a payment of $ 550,000 to women who alleged foremen forced them to trade sex for job security. However, the settlement reached Tuesday has to be approved by a federal judge and potential plaintiffs in the suit, which attorneys for the six original plaintiffs say may be broadened to a class action. Some of the six also are part of a 44-person racial discrimination suit filed against <ORGANIZATION> Caulkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Groves </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Martin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. No trial date has been set. <PERSON> Caulkins </PERSON> lawyer <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Richeson </PERSON> said that under the agreement, the grower admits no guilt by settling the case. Under the tentative agreement, <PERSON> Caulkins </PERSON>' insurers would pay $ 550,000 in a lump sum to the six women who sued in 1986, alleging they were regularly forced to trade sex for job security, shuffled into lower-paying, hard-working jobs and denied advancement. <PERSON> Caulkins </PERSON>, a limited partnership based at <LOCATION> Indiantown </LOCATION>, owns citrus groves, a feed mill, a juice plant that makes concentrate and a car dealership. From the late 1960s or early 1970s, women employees have given statements saying they were raped by grove foremen. The latest incident occurred in 1980.

 Hundreds of factory workers smashed windows and furniture at the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday to press demands in a labor dispute, and police dispersed them with tear gas. Police said five officers were slightly injured. <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> radio said 15 protesters were injured by inhaling tear gas and several ministry employees were hit by broken glass. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said 16 protesters were arrested. `` We did n't intend to break into the ministry,'' <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>, head of the workers' committee, said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television. `` We are sorry for what happened. It was just all the anger and frustration coming out.'' Violence began after 400 workers from Beit Shemesh Engines held an authorized demonstration outside the ministry. A few started burning tires, pelted the building with stones and eggs, then used an overturned garbage can to force open the door, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The workers did not obey our orders and overturned a police barrier,'' said police Lt. <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Lapidot </PERSON>. `` Then several dozen broke into the ministry, smashing windows and plants.'' Police fired tear gas about 15 minutes later, <PERSON> Lapidot </PERSON> said. Paramilitary border police and mounted police were called to assist. `` We do not fear tear gas!'' <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> shouted through a megaphone as he led the workers to another rally outside the nearby <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> building. No further violence was reported. The workers were protesting the breakdown of talks on compensation for 260 workers laid off at the plant, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s largest producer of aircraft engines <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Medina </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> the demands of the workers were `` highly exaggerated'' and could not be met.

 Here is a transcript of Soviet Communist Party General Secretary <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s remarks Wednesday on exchanging documents with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> putting the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty into effect. Esteemed Mr. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, distinguished ladies and gentleman, comrades. We are approaching the end of the meeting between the leaders of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the fourth such meeting in three years. The visit of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> president to our country is drawing to a close. The president and I have summed up the results of a dialogue between our two countries at the highest level. We have discussed both the immediate and the longer term prospects for Soviet-US relations. We have signed documents which record what has been achieved and provide guidelines for the future. Among them, a historic place will belong to the ratification documents which give effect to the treaty and intermediate and shorter range missiles. The exchange a few minutes ago of the instruments of ratification, means that the era of nuclear disarmament has begun. Assessing the work done over these past few days, we can state our satisfaction, say what has been happening these few days in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> is big politics, politics that effect the interests of millions and millions of people. Each such meting dealt a blow at the foundations of Cold War. Each of them made huge breaches in the Cold War fortress and opened up passages to modern, civilized world politics worthy of the truly new times. But big politics means difficult politics, in which every step is not easy to take. Weighing carefully each one of our new steps, we measure it against the security interests of our two nations and of the world as a whole, for that is the only way to achieve truly substantial results with the necessary margin of viability. Big politics also means big responsibility, and so it can not be built on pursuing one's own interest, which is always inherently one-sided. Such politics also needs a great idea. <LOCATION> Humankind </LOCATION> has conceived that idea in the pangs of wars and disasters, tragedies and calamities, strivings and discoveries of the 20th century. This, is in our view, is the idea of a nuclear-free and non-violent world. It is that idea that is inscribed in the mandate which the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> people give to their representatives at the start to any negotiations. This particularly applies to our negotiations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Addressing the Soviet people and the Americans, addressing all nations from these hallowed steps of the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Kremlin, I hereby declare we have been working honestly and with perseverance, and we shall continue to do so, to fulfill that historic mandate. The first lines have already been written into the book of a world without violence and wars and nuclear weapons. I believe that no one can now close that book and put it aside. President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and I have agreed that the immediate task before us, which is to conclude a treaty on 50 percent reduction in strategic offensive arms, can and must be accomplished. In our joint endeavors and discussions we have learned to understand each other better, to take into account each others concerns and to search for solutions. The atmosphere in our relations is improving. We are working to make it a constant, not only in our official contacts, but also in the day-to-day management of Soviet-US relations. In this, too, we are guided by a mandate from our peoples. Thanks to the atmosphere of the meetings in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, and as a result of agreements reached, Americans and Soviet people now have more opportunities for communication and for getting to know each other. I'm convinced that scientists, students, schoolchildren, cultural personalities, ordinary tourists, athletes, and of course businessmen will continue to enlarge and add new colors to the fabric of cooperative and even friendly relations. Sometimes they can do that better than politicians. Historians who will one day describe and evaluate what is now being done have probably not yet been born. But every day babies are being born who will live in the 21st century, and to whom we must bequeath a safe and humane world. On behalf of the Soviet leadership and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> people, I wish to tell all those who are concerned and yet hopeful about the future, we shall work to achieve that goal. And we can only do it by working together. Thank you.

 Here is the text of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s remarks Wednesday after he and <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> exchanged instruments of ratification on the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty. Mr. General Secretary, these are historic moments. As we exchange these documents, the instruments of ratification on this treaty, the terms of which we formally agreed to last December in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> enters into force. Mr. General Secretary, you know that our way here has not been easy. At crucial moments, your personal intervention was needed and proved decisive. And for this we are grateful. So too, Mr. General Secretary, you are aware of how important the objective, not just of arms control, but of arms reduction, has been to my own thinking and to the policy of my administration since its outset. Seven years ago, when I first suggested the concept of a double zero treaty, there were those who said that this was so unrealistic an idea that it was irresponsible to even propose it. Others simply dismissed the proposals as a propaganda ploy or a geopolitical gambit. Skepticism and doubt bring a barren harvest. Today, on this table before us, we see the fruits of hope, evidence of what candor and realism can accomplish. We have dared to hope, Mr. General Secretary, and we have been rewarded. For the first time in history, an entire class of U.S.-Soviet nuclear missiles is eliminated. In addition, this treaty provides for the most stringent verification in history. And for the first time in history, inspection teams are actually in residence in our respective countries. But while this treaty makes possible a new dimension of cooperation between us, much remains on our agenda. We must not stop here, Mr. General Secretary. There is much more to be done. As will be seen in our joint statement later today, more progress has been made toward a strategic arms treaty during our meetings. We must try to move forward in the months ahead to complete this START treaty as soon as possible. So let us continue to expand the frontiers of trust, even as we verify, Mr. General Secretary, even as we verify. Mr. General Secretary, we have agreed many times that there remain differences _ important, fundamental differences _ between us. Yet as we work over the long run to narrow these differences, as we work for what I hope will be a new era of peace and expanded human freedom, we must also acknowledge our solemn responsibility to take steps now to reduce the chances of conflict and to prevent war. This we have done today, the first step toward a brighter future, a safer world. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s allies and friends welcome this treaty too. We consulted them fully during its negotiation. We made clear that we would never put their security or their interests at risk, that on the contrary we would sign a treaty only if it enhanced their security, as this one does. And, finally, if I may, I would like to take a moment to thank the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for their work on this treaty. The way of democracy is sometimes a complicated way, sometimes trying. But it is a good way and, we believe, the best way. And once again, Mr. General Secretary, I want to extend to you and to all those to who labored hard for this moment, my warmest personal thanks.

<HEAD>Congress Urged To Regulate Test-Tube Baby Industry</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Physicians are overpromising success to women desperate to have children and there is need for congressional oversight of the $ 30 million to $ 40 million test-tube baby industry, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was told Wednesday. `` Under the best of circumstances, infertile couples already face invasive medical procedures, the risk of dangerous complications and low success rates,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON>, D-Ore. `` Frustrated couples, many at an emotional breaking point, should n't also have to face those who would exploit their faith in modern medicine. <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on regulation and business opportunities, said he wants to determine what role the government should play in protecting would-be parents from unscrupulous clinics. He called attention to a recent study that found more than half of the 169 clinics in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> performing in-vitro fertilization -LRB- IVF -RRB- in 1987 never produced a baby. `` Despite advances in technology and the claims made by some clinics, the chance of having a baby from IVF still hovers at one in ten,'' <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON> said. `` This slim opportunity costs most couples thousands of dollars. The subcommittee has heard of couples spending over $ 22,000 without yielding a baby in the bassinet.'' The infertility study for the congressional <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assessment </ORGANIZATION> showed Americans spent $ 1 billion last year to combat infertility. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>, who directed the <ORGANIZATION> OTA </ORGANIZATION> study, told the subcommittee the chances of becoming clinically pregnant _ when a fetus's heartbeat is detected by ultrasound machines _ is about 17 percent, and a woman still faces a one in three chance that the pregnancy is ectopic or that it will end in a miscarriage or stillbirth An ectopic pregnancy is one outside the uterus. Therefore, he said, a woman's chance of taking home a test-tube baby is about 6 percent. He said that infertility, generally defined as the inability of a couple to conceive after 12 months of intercourse without contraception, affects an estimated 2.4 million married couples and an unknown number of would-be parents among unmarried couples and singles. <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON>'s subcommittee also heard from a woman, <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckhardt </PERSON>, who said a fertility expert over a four-year span told her seven times that she was pregnant, but that each time would find the fetus had been `` absorbed.'' Her husband, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON>, said they had spent $ 35,000 on infertility treatments, only to learn from another doctor that Mrs. <PERSON> Eckhardt </PERSON> probably never had been pregnant. The doctor, she said, `` out and out lied to use, telling us I was pregnant. `` Each time I felt like I had failed again, that my own body was killing our baby,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Eckhardt </PERSON> said. `` But then I would get that little urge again and want a baby so badly that I would go through anything. `` It's hard to explain to other people, but when you want a baby so badly and you're afraid you may never be able to have one, it's all you can think about It affects the way you see the whole world.''

<TEXT>
 Mental health advocates filed suit Wednesday against Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his top budget officer, contending spending cuts ordered to balance the state budget were unconstitutional and would delay community placement of state hospital patients. The suit by the Alliance for the Mentally Ill said human services programs bear too much of the burden in the cancellation of nearly $ 250 million in planned state spending for the fiscal year that ends June 30. The suit, filed with the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, also asserted that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and state Secretary of Administration and Finance <PERSON> Fran </PERSON> <PERSON> Keefe </PERSON> acted unconstitutionally in rolling back spending without the approval of the Legislature. The alliance asked for an injunction prohibiting the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> administration from ordering the `` reversions'' _ cuts that do not affect basic services but cancel or trim planned program expansion. No hearing date was set. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, whose state budget problems have become an issue in his Democratic presidential campaign, has defended his administration's record in aiding the mentally ill He has said the past three years have seen `` the most significant expansion in the history of the state'' in spending for the mentally ill. `` We'll do everything we can to make sure patient care is first class in our state hospitals,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said `` That is a commitment I feel very strongly.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Pregnancy and abortion rates in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are among the highest found in a new study of Western nations, averaging 2.56 pregnancies and 0.76 abortions for each woman of reproductive age. Only <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> showed higher pregnancy rates, with 4.33 and 3.23 respectively, in the study of 17 industrialized countries. <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> also had a higher abortion rate, 2.24, as did <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, with 0.80, according to researchers at <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guttmacher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> organization that studies fertility issues. The study appears in the current issue of the institute's Family Planning Perspectives. The lowest pregnancy rates appeared in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, with 1.64, and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, with 1.68. The lowest abortion rates were in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, with 0.15, and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, with 0.18. Abortion is outlawed by <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and another nation in the study, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, although abortions are still relatively easy to to obtain in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, the researchers wrote. Substantial limitations are imposed by <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, the scientists said. The other countries in the survey were <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. The study was based on the year of most recent abortion data, which was 1983 for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Researchers also compared contraceptive use among the 17 nations plus <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. Some method of contraception was used in 1982 by about 54 percent of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women of reproductive age, defined as ages 15 to 44, researchers said. That level ranked relatively low, along with those of <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. About 37 percent of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women used a contraceptive pill, an intra-uterine device or male or female sterilization, a `` medium'' level of use in comparison to the other countries. That showing is largely due to widespread use of sterilization, researchers said.

 To get American military forces out of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> should offer much more than shutting down the biggest Soviet overseas base at <LOCATION> Cam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ranh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military strategist <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> said Wednesday. A Cam Ranh-Philippines tradeoff by the superpowers `` would be very much in the Soviet interest but not necessarily ours,'' said <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, a retired air force lieutenant general and national security adviser in the Ford administration. `` The Russians do n't need that -LRB- Cam Ranh -RRB- nearly as much as we do the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>,'' he said. Scowcroft spoke at a news conference marking the issuance of a new expert study on forthcoming U.S.-Philippines base negotiations produced for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Foreign Relations, a non-profit, non-partisan organization. The study noted that the massive Soviet military presence at <LOCATION> Cam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ranh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> is used as justification for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military presence in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and vice versa. Analysts have said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s July 1986 Asian policy speech suggesting a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pullout from the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> implied an offer to reduce the Soviet presence in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. The Philippine bases, <LOCATION> Clark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION> air base and <LOCATION> Subic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> naval station, are vital for deploying <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces to the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> while `` the Soviets can get to the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> through the back door'' from the other direction, <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> said. He predicted that practical benefits to both countries are likely to result in enough accomodation to produce a new U.S.-Philippines base agreement when the current one expires in 1991. `` There is a fair chance that cool heads will prevail,'' he said. Scowcroft and Prof. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> Asian affairs expert and editor of the 155-page study, emphasized that the issues are complex, tangled and emotional. Ever since 1947, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has handled base arrangements with the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> through executive agreements requiring majority votes in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for implementation. However, a two-thirds <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote is required to ratify a treaty, and many in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> are demanding this form for the next base agreement so as to highlight Philippine sovereignty and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> payment obligations, <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> said. That would play into the hands of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> senators and others `` who for budget or policy reasons would like to have reductions around the world, especially if the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> insists on a treaty,'' <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> said. Estimating that 20 percent of Filipinos oppose the bases, he said many are `` very intense and eloquent'' in their opposition.

 Acting Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON> said Wednesday he believes Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> will remain at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> until the end of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. During his first day on the job, <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON> said `` I do n't have any sense of crisis at all'' and that the department `` is functioning well,'' despite a wave of departures in the past few months.

Asked whether he had any reservations when first approached about coming to the department in view of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s ongoing legal problems, <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON> told reporters: `` I had no qualms then and I do n't have any today.'' <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON> is filling the post on an acting basis pending the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation process and said he thinks it unlikely he will wind up running the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. While he has not discussed <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s plans with the attorney general, `` my personal perception'' is that he will `` stay through Jan. 20 ... the attorney general will complete the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration,'' <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Ag Exports for March Highest Since December 1984</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm exports in March climbed to a 3 -LCB- - year high of 14.8 million tons valued at $ 3.3 billion, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced Wednesday `` Agriculture is making an important contribution to the trade balance of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> before the figures were released. In his remarks, <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> predicted around $ 33 billion in export sales this year and a positive farm trade balance of perhaps $ 12 billion. March exports easily topped figures for the same month last year, which were 11.4 million tons valued at $ 2.4 billion. It was the best monthly performance since December 1984. The nation posted an agricultural trade surplus in March of $ 1.38 billion, the fifth straight month that the balance sheet has been $ 1 billion or more in the black, the department said. It said the March surplus was the largest since December 1984 also. Fiscal 1988 agricultural exports through March totaled 77.3 million tons valued at $ 17.8 billion, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> said. It said that represented an increase of 13.6 million tons and $ 3.3 billion from the same period last year. Agriculture Department economists are forecasting fiscal 1988 exports totaling 145.5 million tons and valued at $ 33.5 billion. That represents an increase over initial estimates. The higher forecasts are due to additional sales of animal and horticultural products, as well as wheat, feeds and fodders and soybeans. Animal products are likely to set a record of $ 5.6 billion, attributable to surprisingly strong demand for hides, skins, red meats and fats, the department said. Exports are expected to be 16 million tons and $ 5.6 billion higher than fiscal 1987, the department said. It attributed the bulk of the increase to diminished supplies among competitor nations and the Export Enhancement Program. The Export Enhancement Program, established by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1985, pays exporters in government surplus commodities to ship American grain overseas. Meanwhile, the department increased its estimate of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural imports from $ 20.5 billion to $ 21 billion. It said imports for March totaled $ 1.95 billion, a gain of $ 35 million, or 2 percent, over the comparable figure for March 1987. It also was $ 24 million, or 1 percent, over the February level. Volume of agricultural imports are virtually unchanged since last year, and fruit juices, nursery products and alcoholic beverages actually posted declines, the department said. But it said the lower dollar has pushed up the total import bill. File Stored As: Z2732 A47 0423 15:53 06-01 -- -- - rwbx AM-Farm Exports

 <ORGANIZATION> Eli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lilly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has dealt a serious setback to the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's anti-cocaine program by refusing to allow use of a `` safe and effective herbicide'' against coca-producing areas in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. `` We think the short-term impact is serious,'' said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON>, alluding to <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON>'s decision last week not to sell to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government the herbicide tebuthurion in a coca eradication campaign focused mainly in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Huallaga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> She said the firm, which is the sole manufacturer of the chemical, should reconsider its decision in light of the serious cocaine problem in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. On <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, Rep. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> English </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., expressed outrage over <ORGANIZATION> Lilly </ORGANIZATION>'s decision The Indianapolis-based company gave no reason for its decision in making the announcement last week, citing only `` a number of practical and policy considerations.'' But Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> told reporters <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON> apparently was worried about possible retaliatory measures by `` traffickers or terrorists.'' The company also had come under pressure from environmentalists who were concerned about the ecological impact of the herbicide. Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> would have preferred to have worked with the company on resolving its security concerns. She said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> governments have been conducting field tests to identify a safe, effective herbicide for use against coca for several years. Tebuthurion, known informally as `` <PERSON> Spike </PERSON>,'' was considered to be among the safest and most effective, but no final decision had been made about which herbicide should be used, Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said. `` According to our information the safety and effectiveness of spike has been clearly demonstrated and defended by the company. Numerous environmental tests have been carried out in compliance with federal regulations,'' she said. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wrobleski </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for international narcotics matters, said <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON> made the decision even though the herbicide has been manufactured for more than 15 years, has been proven safe by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> standards and is widely available in this country for projects such as clearing brush for rights of way. The chemical is sold to other government agencies including the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, she said. Testifying before a House Government Operations subcommittee assessing the war on drugs, Ms. <PERSON> Wrobleski </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers are researching whether to propose legislation that would compel <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON> to sell the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> the chemical `` in the vital national interests of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government.'' The safety of <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON>'s employees must be weighed against public concerns about `` the 5 million regular users of cocaine and our desperate need for a chemical solution to widespread coca cultivation in the Andes,'' she said. English, chairman of the subcommittee, said he was `` stunned and outraged'' at <ORGANIZATION> Lilly </ORGANIZATION> and called the company a `` deserter'' in the war on drugs. He insisted that company representatives appear before his panel to explain their decision. `` We're going to go to any length possible to get our hands on'' the herbicide for use in spraying programs in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Wrobleski </PERSON> said. She said coca crops currently are destroyed by chopping them down, a slow process that eradicates less than 1 percent of the total. `` Unless we push the chemical button, we can not dent that problem appreciably,'' Ms. <PERSON> Wrobleski </PERSON> said.

 Surgeons Wednesday gave up trying to reattach a 5-year-old boy's right arm, torn off at the shoulder, concluding after nine hours in the operating room that the damage to the limb and shoulder was too great. <PERSON> Fidencio </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaurequi </PERSON>, whose arm became caught in a farm machine used to sort cherry tomatoes, was in critical condition at <ORGANIZATION> Tampa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. He was expected to remain in the pediatric intensive care unit several days. Three surgeons from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> spent from 3:15 p.m. Tuesday until 12:20 a.m. in the operating room. `` Preliminary procedures had been performed,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKell </PERSON>, vice president of medical affairs. `` Regrettably, the injury was so severe, with so much destruction of the tissue, that it was not possible to rejoin the extremity.'' The child, the son of <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Eustolia </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaurequi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, had gone to a barn at Singletary Farms where his mother was working, according to a co-owner of the 75-acre vegetable farm. `` He stuck his arm into the machine'' and it got caught under the conveyor belt on the roller, said <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Singletary </PERSON>, who was outside the barn when the accident occurred Tuesday. The severed limb was retrieved from the sorting machine. `` I had them put ice on his arm ... and I held a shirt up on his arm _ that much I knew to do,'' <PERSON> Singletary </PERSON> said. Rescue workers arrived 13 minutes after the accident was reported and packed the limb in ice and a saline solution, said <ORGANIZATION> Pasco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Derryl </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neal </PERSON>. Less than 20 minutes after the accident, the boy and severed arm were taken by helicopter 45 miles to <ORGANIZATION> Tampa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> O'Neal </PERSON> said. Three surgeons and three nurses from the hospital's microsurgery team were called in. <PERSON> Singletary </PERSON> said Tuesday that the child should not have been in the barn. `` We do n't allow them in the tomato barn for just that reason,'' <PERSON> Singletary </PERSON> said. `` Little kids do n't belong around farm machinery. `` We have a safety cut-off switch ... but it just happened so fast,'' he said.

<HEAD>FAA Creating Special Office To Combat Air Drug Trafficking</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> plans to play a greater role in keeping aviation out of the drug trafficking business, the agency's chief said Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> announced he is assigning 13 people within the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> to a special office that will deal exclusively with illegal drug trafficking issues. `` This is a serious problem and we want to be a serious player,'' <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> told reporters after disclosing his anti-drug plans in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said he was n't ready to provide details as to exactly what the new <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> office would do except to say it would coordinate the agency's efforts to battle the smuggling of illegal drugs by air. `` We're going to be developing their mission as we go along,'' <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said, adding that the group may be expanded in the future. He said the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials would have no enforcement or police powers and that he had no intention of confiscating commercial aircraft should small amounts of drugs be found. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> recently have been criticized for confiscating expensive yachts under a `` zero tolerance'' anti-drug enforcement program when only small amounts of an illegal drug were found. <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said the new <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> office would consist of agency security officers, inspectors and perhaps even air traffic controllers. The shift of manpower from the inspector and controller ranks comes at a time when the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> has acknowledged shortages in both areas. <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> conceded that `` the commitment of 13 people is a big deal'' for the agency, but that he wants the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> to `` become a full player'' in the war against illegal drugs. He also suggested the airlines and private pilot groups `` begin to help police themselves ... to keep -LRB- illegal -RRB- drugs out of our industry.''

<HEAD>Aviation Industry Holds Conference In Wake Of Aloha Airlines
Incident</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An aviation industry stunned by the in-flight breakup last month of an <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet began a formal re-examination Wednesday of how to ensure that aging aircraft are kept safe. More than 350 representatives from airlines, aircraft manufacturers, government agencies and various aviation safety groups launched a three-day conference by debating whether the industry's approach to maintaining the safety of older planes is adequate. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> suggested that a central question which must be resolved is whether to continue the current philosophy that relies heavily on inspections or shift the focus to a system of mandatory repairs or, at some point, mandatory aircraft retirement. Concerns about aging aircraft among the commercial airliner fleets surfaced last month when a 20-foot section of an <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 tore away at 24,000 feet. A flight attendant was swept to her death, but the pilots managed to get the plane on the ground. The 19-year-old Aloha plane was one of the oldest <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s in service and had accumulated nearly 90,000 takeoffs and landings. Investigators believe cracking and corrosion in the upper forwared part of the cabin likely caused the section of the plane to peel away during flight. The central question confronting Wednesday's conference centered on why the apparent cracking and corrosion on the Aloha plane were not detected by inspectors. An <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> directive last year had required closer inspection of older aircraft for cabin skin cracking and corrosion. During the three-day meeting, the industry representatives are expected to debate whether aircraft design improvements need to be made and what steps need to be taken to improve the maintenance and inspection process so that such failures will not occur in the future. `` I think we might find that the procedures are adequate, but I'm not convinced the procedures are being done with as much discipline as we might expect,'' <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> suggested in remarks to reporters. He said he did not expect any conclusive findings to come out of the conference, but said it likely will spawn additional, private sessions in the coming months on the aging aircraft issue. Several members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> addressed the group and raised concerns about the maintenenance of older jetliners. Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON>, D-Kan., suggested that the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> buy old jetliners and test them to determine when a plane no longer can be considred safe `` Only by answering the question ` How long can airplanes really last?' will we be able to put into place guideines which could save thousands of lives,'' said <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON>. But <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associaton </ORGANIZATION>, the airline trade group, said that aircraft if properly maintained and inspected can be flown safely `` throughout their economically useful life'' and well beyond their design life. One of the questions confronting the conference, however, is whether the industry should continue to use `` economic life'' as the key factor in determining when a plane should be taken of service, suggested <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Enders </PERSON>, an aviation consultant for the <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. As for the heavy emphasis on inspections, <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> accident demonstrates the `` inadequacies of the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s maintenance inspection system. <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> officials have said repeatedly that they followed all required inspections on the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 that broke apart in flight. `` It obviously was n't sufficient,'' said <PERSON> Enders </PERSON>, the aviation consultant. `` The -LRB- <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> -RRB- inspections were not enough to give the early warning signs.''

 An AIDS hot line has expanded from 130 operators to 220 to accommodate a rush of calls generated in part by an educational pamphlet mailed to 10 million <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> homes, officials said. `` We're still in the beginning of the rush,'' said <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphries </PERSON>, coordinator for the National AIDS Hotline in Research Triangle Park. `` Not everybody in the country has gotten the pamphlet yet.'' The government pamphlet `` Understanding AIDS'' forced hot line officials to recruit operators through advertisements, flyers and the news media.

Officials expect 2 million calls in 1988. `` I think we're going to be at full capacity once we get everyone trained,'' Ms. <PERSON> Humphries </PERSON> said. `` Things have been going rather smoothly.''

 An explosion ripped through a coal shaft in central <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> today, killing at least 16 miners and trapping 40 of their comrades more than 300 feet underground. `` There is little hope that other miners can be found alive,'' said <PERSON> Gottfried </PERSON> <PERSON> Milde </PERSON>, the Hesse state interior minister. `` It's horrible, my husband is down there!'' said <PERSON> Ingrid </PERSON> <PERSON> Henke </PERSON>, 35. `` My daughters are aged just one and two.'' One woman who would not give her name, but said her husband was not in the shaft, said: `` All the women in this part of town are doing their best to comfort each other.'' Mayor <PERSON> Bernd </PERSON> <PERSON> Hessler </PERSON> of <PERSON> Borken </PERSON> told a news conference Wednesday night the bodies of 16 miners had been found and the search continued for about 40 others. What caused the blast had not been determined. Some reports said explosives stored in the shaft detonated and others said it was due to a buildup of coal dust. `` I have no real hopes. I think we'll have to bury a lot of people,'' said <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Hausmann </PERSON>, a mechanic who has worked at the mine for 20 years. Reports of the number of men trapped in the mine varied throughout the day, with some officials putting it as high as 60 and others as low as 54. <PERSON> Milde </PERSON> said the total number, including the confirmed dead, was 56. Rescue crews managed to get about 300 feet underground before the shaft collapsed. `` This reduces the chance of finding many survivors,'' a police spokesman who requested anonymity told reporters. He said rescue crews were pumping oxygen into the shaft. <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, an engineer for mine owner <ORGANIZATION> Preussen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elektra </ORGANIZATION>, said the explosion occurred in a pit between 200 and 450 feet below ground. <ORGANIZATION> Preussen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elektra </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION> is one of the largest utility companies in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.

 A Western diplomatic source said today that 28 refusenik cases have not been cleared for emigration, contrary to information that a Jewish refusenik leader provided earlier to members of the news media. The diplomatic source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Jewish leader had misunderstood information exchanged at a meeting of six refuseniks and Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shifter </PERSON>. <PERSON> Yuli </PERSON> <PERSON> Kosharovsky </PERSON>, who has been refused permission to emigrate for 17 years, said in a telephone interview that the refuseniks gave Shifter a list of 400 refusenik cases in a meeting Saturday. `` The Americans made a presentation about these cases and on 28 of them they received positive answers,'' he said. But the diplomatic source said there had been a misunderstanding in the meeting and that the 28 cases had not been resolved. Other Jewish refuseniks said today that more than a dozen families who previously had been denied permission to emigrate were told immediately before and during the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit that they could leave. <PERSON> Refusenik </PERSON> <PERSON> Bella </PERSON> <PERSON> Gulko </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinshtock </PERSON> and <PERSON> Iosif </PERSON> <PERSON> Pilmenshtein </PERSON> families of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> had received permission to emigrate this week, as well as a retiree she only could identify by the last name Brave. She said seven <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> families also had receive permission to emigrate within the past week or 10 days. The Soviet decisions seemed to have been related to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s visit, Mrs. <PERSON> Gulko </PERSON> said, adding that `` usually there are only one or two'' approvals of exit visas in that length of time It was not known whether any of the names mentioned by Mrs. <PERSON> Gulko </PERSON> were on <PERSON> Kosharovsky </PERSON>'s list. Another refusenik leader, <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Mkrtchyan </PERSON>, said he was summoned to the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> visa office on Saturday and was given permission to emigrate on Monday. Mkrtchyan is a leader of the `` poor relatives'' group of family members who refuse to waive financial claims to allow them to emigrate. <PERSON> Mkrtchyan </PERSON>, his wife and year-old daughter demonstrated daily in downtown <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> last week. He said he was called to the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> visa office after the last demonstration on Saturday. <PERSON> Mkrtchyan </PERSON> said he believed that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s visit `` absolutely'' influenced the Soviet authorities' decision to allow him to leave the country after he was denied permission for three years. He said pressure from other Westerners and his own activities also helped. <PERSON> Kosharovsky </PERSON> said his list apparently did not include <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tanya </PERSON> <PERSON> Zieman </PERSON> and their daughter, <PERSON> Vera </PERSON>. The president had considered visiting the Ziemans on Sunday, the day he arrived for summit talks with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, but decided against it. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sources have said that Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Bessmertnykh </PERSON> warned <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON> last week that if <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> visited the Ziemans they would never would be allowed to leave. Among others who met with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Monday and who apparently are not on the list approved for exit visas were <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Charney </PERSON>, <PERSON> Valdimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kislik </PERSON> and <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> <PERSON> Stolar </PERSON>, according to <PERSON> Kosharovsky </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has been unable to stem the flood of drugs into this country because of budget cuts and delays in making crucial detection equipment operational, two federal agencies said Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Commandant <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenblatt </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> enforcement chief, told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee they increasingly were frustrated by their inability to throw more resources into the anti-drug effort. They gave the panel a long list of problems they encountered: patrol boats and planes sitting idle due to a money shortage; surveillance airplanes with cracks in their wings; construction delays at new intelligence centers; and delayed installation of radar balloons along the nation's border with <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Yost </PERSON>, whose new, fast patrol boats and airplanes are operating at only 55 percent of last year's levels, said it was ironic that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is ready to spend huges sums for an escalation of the military's role in the drug war, but ca n't find $ 60 million to get his vessels in the water and planes in the air full time. `` Turn me loose and do n't give my mission away,'' he told the Government Operations subcommittee on information, justice and agriculture. Rep. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> English, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., chairman of the panel, was sharply critical of the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, blaming the agency for delays in installing five radar balloons along the porous <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> border to detect airborne drug smugglers Only one of the five balloons, called aerostats, is in operation. `` This is a terrible failure,'' he told <PERSON> Rosenblatt </PERSON>. `` You are costing us dearly. There's no sense of urgency about this. That's the problem. <PERSON> Rosenblatt </PERSON> described a series of delays in site selection, environmental problems, competitive bidding and even roadblocks from other government agencies. `` We had to work around interference with the military and other agencies,'' <PERSON> Rosenblatt </PERSON> said. In Alpine, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, he said, there was a problem of interference with a private observatory. In another instance, <PERSON> Rosenblatt </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a government agency, initially declined to allow an aerostat on a site. That agency has changed its mind, <PERSON> Rosenblatt </PERSON> said. `` Two years later,'' English interjected. When <PERSON> Rosenblatt </PERSON> said he spent four months seeking competitive bids for the radar balloons in an effort to save money, English said, `` In effect, you cost us a heck of a lot of money'' because <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> AWACS surveillance planes have had to patrol the <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> border to pick up the slack. English said that an AWACS costs $ 7,500 an hour to operate. `` Without a detection system, interceptors and bust -LRB- arrest -RRB- teams are nearly worthless,'' English said. `` You hired pilots, purchased aircraft and hired bust teams who have to sit on the ground for up to two years before they will be able to do their mission. `` It calls into question whether the air interdictioin war is capable of being more than a skirmish in the next two years.'' <PERSON> Rosenblatt </PERSON> replied, `` We're trying our darndest to get these things in there. I share your frustration.'' <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> called it `` an outrage'' that his agency had to cut back drug patrols. He blamed congressional appropriations committees, complaining that money was taken from the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> budget to pay for mass transit programs. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has asked for $ 60 million to be switched to the Coast Guard from other programs of the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> _ the parent agency _ but <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has not yet acted, <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> said. `` My budget needs to be protected against mass transit,'' <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> said. When <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> told the panel that <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> law enforcement teams stationed on <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships seized just 20 drug vessels last year, English said, `` It does n't seem we're setting the world on fire.'' He suggested reducing the program and using the money for fuel for the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s idle patrol boats.

<HEAD>Panel Says Anti-Discrimination Law Critical To AIDS Fight</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The head of a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> committee on AIDS said Wednesday that federal legislation shielding carriers of the virus from discrimination is crucial to fighting the epidemic. Calling that `` the first of equals'' among several other recommendations in a new report, <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said providing adequate protection against discrimination would form the foundation for many other things that need to be done, such as expanded voluntary testing for the virus. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration opposes federal anti-discrimination laws to protect AIDS carriers, and such protections were dropped recently from AIDS legislation working its way through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, who is also chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, acknowledged that winning passage will not be easy. He said the solution is to `` get the message to the attention of both the president and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, reiterate it and make it strong enough.'' He called such a federal law banning discrimination `` fundamental to the success of the program'' to combat AIDS. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said the need for strong guidance on such basic policy areas as discrimination legislation is one reason the committee recommended creation of a new high-level AIDS commission to replace the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel that goes out of business later this month. <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, staff director of the academy's AIDS committee, noted that the report issued Wednesday `` places much greater emphasis on expanded voluntary testing'' than a 1986 report _ in part as a way to get a better handle on the extent to which the virus has spread. Such an expansion, she added, `` rests on comfort of people being protected against discrimination'' if they test positive. Indeed, a major new element in the updated report _ a joint project of the academy and its <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> _ is a call for revising the definition of AIDS as a disease to include the hundreds of thousands of Americans unknowingly infected with the virus. The committee's recommendation to focus on the numbers of those infected with the virus _ rather than actual AIDS cases reported _ reflected what the panel said was a growing consensus that `` the vast majority of persons'' with the virus `` will eventually progress to AIDS if no treatment is found to slow or halt the progression of the infection.'' The Centers for Disease Control estimates that as many as 1.4 million Americans are infected with the virus. The report said evidence is now `` scientifically conclusive'' that the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, is what causes AIDS. The panel said many people infected with the virus suffer from `` clinical syndromes and laboratory test abnormalities that signal the presence of disease but do not meet'' technical guidelines for being listed as either AIDS or AIDS-Related Complex, known as ARC. `` The committee believes that the term ARC is no longer useful, either from a clinical or a public health perspective, and that HIV infection itself should be considered a disease,'' said the report. `` Viewing HIV infection as a disease is important because it may eventually be amenable to treatment and patients will need to be diagnosed and treated as early as possible. `` Clinically, it is more accurate to describe HIV infection as a continuum of conditions associated with immune dysfunction,'' it said. `` From a public health perspective the important event is infection rather than full-blown disease because even asymptomatic infected persons are capable of infecting others.'' The report also called for development of federal standards for labs doing AIDS testing and spelled out that the only mandatory AIDS testing the committee backs is that involving the donation of blood and organs for transplant. In the section calling for a new AIDS commission, the committee singled out Surgeon General <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> for `` continuing superb leadership'' and cited biomedical researchers, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> as `` areas of progress'' within the federal government. `` Nevertheless, the committee has concluded that the federal response has been too uneven,'' it said. AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a contagious disease that attacks the body's immune system, rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases and infections. The virus most often is spread through close contact with blood, blood products or semen from infected persons. As of May 23, AIDS had been diagnosed in about 62,740 Americans, of whom more than half, or 35,188 have died since June 1981, according to the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>. No one is known to have recovered from AIDS.

 Here, at a glance, are Wednesday's developments at the summit meeting between President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SUMMIT CONCLUSION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The leaders exchanged the documents of ratification of the intermediate-range nuclear arms treaty -LRB- INF -RRB- signed last December, and said they would press for an agreement to cut strategic nuclear weapons. A joint communique said `` common ground'' had been reached during the summit on verifying the numbers of mobile missiles and cruise missiles carried by airplanes, important elements in any strategic-arms treaty. `` The first lines have already been written into a book of the world without nuclear weapons,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> praised the INF treaty as a `` first step toward a brighter future, a safer world.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>REAGAN NEWS CONFERENCE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> muted his criticism of Soviet leadership and said Soviet emigration restrictions may be `` bound in by bureaucracy,'' rather than the result of deliberate Kremlin policy. The president said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was `` different than previous Soviet leaders have been,'' and that has eased differences between the superpowers but, `` I am never going to relax my belief in the need for verification.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>GORBACHEV NEWS CONFERENCE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> characterized the summit as `` in depth, at times intense'' and hailed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for disavowing his view of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as an evil empire. On human rights, he said that when <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` tried to persuade me to change my mind,'' I said, `` your explanations are not convincing ... I am not filled with admiration at this aspect of the visit.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also said the Americans objected to describing the superpowers' goal in the joint communique as `` peaceful coexistence,'' or even `` coexistence.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ARMS NEGOTIATIONS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Although progress was reported on mobile missiles and air-launched cruise missiles, the two sides were still divided on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> `` Star Wars'' program, submarine-fired cruise missiles, and reductions in conventional forces. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told reporters `` it is still possible to sign an agreement in this administration.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said progress `` is still being made or we would n't be talking as we are.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>REFUSENIKS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 At his news conference, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> blamed Soviet bureaucracy rather than Soviet policy for restrictions on emigration, remarks that surprised some `` refuseniks,'' those denied permission to emigrate. <PERSON> Tanya </PERSON> <PERSON> Zieman </PERSON>, a prominent Soviet refusenik, speculated that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> merely did not want to spoil any agreement that was achieved with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on human rights.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ECONOMIC SANCTIONS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> criticized <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law that limits trade relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as long as the Soviets restrict emigration. `` Authoritative parts of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> business circles would like to do business,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said at his news conference. `` They are faced with intimidation and all sorts of restrictions. ... We should base our policies on present-day realities.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>FINAL EVENING</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The Reagans spent their last evening in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> with the <ORGANIZATION> Gorbachevs </ORGANIZATION>, sharing the royal box at the Bolshoi Theater for 90 minutes of ballet. The couples then dined privately at the <ORGANIZATION> Gorbachevs </ORGANIZATION>' country dacha.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>NANCY AND RAISA</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> dropped all pretense of a hand-holding friendship in a rivalry Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> called a `` Mexican standoff.'' The women maintained the appearance of cordiality during a tour of an icon storage vault, but <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s press secretary, said after the tour, `` They are from two totally different worlds.'' Told that Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had not mentioned the icons' religious heritage, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> responded, `` I do n't know how you can neglect the religious implications. I mean they are there, when you see them.''

 Here are some excerpts from the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> report on AIDS issued Tuesday.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>GENERAL</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The committee believes that AIDS is a special case among current diseases. It is a fatal, infectious disease for which there is now no cure and its sufferers appear to remain infectious for life.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<HEAD>EPIDEMIOLOGY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The committee believes that the evidence that HIV causes AIDS is scientifically conclusive. ... Current information suggests that the vast majority of persons who are seropositive _ that is, carrying antibodies _ for HIV will eventually progress to AIDS if no treatment is found to slow or halt the progression of the infection.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<HEAD>SPECTRUM OF INFECTION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 It has long been apparent ... that many HIV-infected persons suffer from clinical syndromes and laboratory test abnormalities that signal the presence of disease but do not meet <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- criteria for AIDS. Earlier in the epidemic, certain clusters of symptoms were said to belong to an AIDS-related complex -LRB- ARC -RRB-, which was incorporated in a <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> definition but never used for case reporting. By now, however, the committee believes that the term ARC is no longer useful, either from a clinical or a public health perspective, and that HIV infection itself should be considered a disease. Viewing HIV infection as a disease is iportant because it may eventually be amenable to treatment and patients will need to be diagnosed and treated as early as possible. ... From a public health perspective the important event is infection rather than full-blown disease because even asymptomatic infected persons are capable of infecting others.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<TEXT>

</TEXT>
<HEAD>ANTIDISCRIMINATION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The committee believes that the fear of discrimination is a major constraint to the wide acceptance of many potentially effective public health measures. ... The committee supports the enactment of a federal statute specifically designed to prevent discrimination on the basis of HIV infection or AIDS.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<TEXT>

</TEXT>
<HEAD>EDUCATION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The committee believes that the gravity of the HIV epidemic is such that <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>. ... should be allowed to purchase advertising time and space and should be supplied with the funds to do so. Explicit information on the risks associated with gay sex and the way those risks can be minimized does not ` promote or encourage' homosexual activities. ... One obstacle to more effective AIDS education has been the long-standing refusal of the media to accept commercial condom advertising.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<TEXT>

</TEXT>
<HEAD>TESTING</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The committee recommends expanded voluntary testing combined with counseling of all those whose behavior may have put them at risk for exposure to HIV. Those who test positive have a moral obligation to inform and protect their sexual or needle-sharing partners. ... The committee believes that, at this time, the only mandatory screening appropriate for public health purposes involves blood, tissue, and organ donation.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<TEXT>

</TEXT>
<HEAD>IV DRUG ABUSE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The committee believes that the gross inadequacy of federal efforts to reduce HIV transmission among IV drug abusers, when considered in relation to the scope and implications of such transmission, is now the most serious deficiency in current efforts to control HIV infection in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<TEXT>

</TEXT>
<HEAD>COMMISSION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The committee proposes the establishment of a national commission on AIDS with a five-year, renewable term. The commission chair should be a senior, recognized leader, engaged full time in this capacity and reporting directly to the president. In addition to the chair, the commission should consist of eight other members, each of whom is a senior expert of national stature in one of the areas of particular relevance to AIDS. Each commissioner should in turn head a panel of experts.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's chief negotiator in efforts to oust <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> ruler Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said Wednesday that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has not been strengthened by the collapse of the talks last week. `` I do n't think he's stronger by any means,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON>, a deputy assistant secretary of state dispatched to talk to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and other Panamanian officials in recent weeks. `` He's not on a winning curve right now. He's treading water. That's something that's not gone away, and it's not going away,'' <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hemisphere </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee. `` General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is a pretty skillful guy ... It's not a stable situation for him,'' he said. <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON>, in his first public appearance since the talks began, commented only generally on the situation in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and declined to answer specific questions in open session about deals the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had offered <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> or even how many times he had met personally with the military chief. <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> deferred giving his answers until a closed-door meeting of the subcommittee immediately after the public session, saying he had given his word to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> that the negotiations would be confidential. He said only that the discussions were not aimed at dictating the composition of the Panamanian government or the role of the Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, which <PERSON> Noreiga </PERSON> heads. Those `` were issues to be decided by Panamanians, perhaps with Latin American mediation, but not by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> said. `` We continue to discuss with a number of governments in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> the efforts they and we can undertake in pursuit of the goal of re-establishing constitutional government in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> also declined to say specifically what other Latin American countries were doing to help persuade <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to relinquish power, although he said there is strong support generally for the effort. `` A number of Latin American countries'' are sending their own emissaries to talk to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, he said. `` There is a fair degree of solidarity.'' Asked by subcommittee members to comment on rumors that <PERSON> Noreiga </PERSON> has been able to cling to power because he has adverse information used to pressure <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, including Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> said he had no evidence that such information exists. `` He has said nothing to me about any information on the vice president or anything else. As far as I know, there's nothing to it,'' he said. <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> said there is a danger that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> might appear too impatient to be rid of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, and conceded it had been a mistake to promote the belief that the problem could be solved quickly. `` American impatience emboldens him,'' he said of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>.

 Six months of top-secret research may be worth all the suspense involved if the two <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> restaurants here are permitted to offer an innovation on their menu: `` Gilroy garlic'' on hamburgers. `` We're the garlic capital of the world and we want to continue that fame in a fast-food restaurant,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON>, owner of one of the <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> and the man who came up with the idea for the garlic spread.

 Fifty-six competitors were eliminated in the first day of the National Spelling Bee today, a contest in which, for once, it was n't just the children who made the mistakes. The 61st annual renewal of the competition began with a record field of 200 contestants. During the third round _ the last of the day _ 43 of them misspelled their way into elimination. Among those making errors were 13-year-old <PERSON> Awilda </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cintron </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ceiba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, who did not begin learning to speak English until the third grade. The eighth-grader misspelled the word strisciando, a musical direction to play in a slurred, smooth manner. As the competition's second round began, bee officials began handing to reporters a list of the words that had been asked during the first round. But the distribution ceased when a reporter pointed out to a tournament official that the list misspelled the word `` hitchhike.'' On the list, the word was spelled `` hitchike.'' `` It was a typing error,'' said bee spokeswoman <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. The first entrant to drop out of the tournament was <PERSON> Monekia </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gause </PERSON>, 11, of <LOCATION> Shallotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, who misspelled the word `` jargon.'' The sixth-grader spelled it `` j-a-r-g-i-n.'' Told she had misspelled the word, she tugged at the sleeves of her pink dress and left the stage `` I never heard it before,'' <PERSON> Monekia </PERSON> said afterward. The first round's only other dropout was <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Yates </PERSON>, 11, of Mentor, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, who responded `` hitchhick'' when asked to spell `` hitchhike.'' The bee has attracted its usual field of gifted children with enough academic achievements to humble most adults, including its youngest competitor ever. She is <PERSON> Iris </PERSON> <PERSON> Liu </PERSON>, a third-grader from <LOCATION> Muncie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, who does n't turn nine until June 20 <PERSON> Iris </PERSON>, whose parents immigrated to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> in 1979 and now own a bookstore, enjoys reading books in English and Chinese when she is n't pursuing one of her other loves: jumping rope. `` Not really,'' she said Tuesday evening when asked if she was nervous. But as if to show that she's only human, she expressed uncertainty about her chances of winning the bee, saying, `` They have some funny words in there.'' This year's field consists of 102 girls and 98 boys from 47 states, the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. It includes <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON>, 14, of <LOCATION> Oroville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, who received no formal institutional schooling until the third grade, according to the bee's biographical booklet. Although contest rules allow children who are not yet 16 and have not progressed beyond the eighth grade, no one competing in the two-day event is 15 years old yet. Last year's winner was <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Petit </PERSON>, an eighth-grader from <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, who correctly spelled `` staphylococci,'' a type of bacteria. It took 876 words to eliminate the 184 other entrants in the 1987 bee. The 13-year-old <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON>, like all previous winners, was not allowed to re-enter the competition. But there are 20 contestants making their second appearances, and two who are competing for a third time: <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Noveloso </PERSON>, 13, of <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Blanc </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Clint </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, 14, of <PERSON> Durant </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Okla </LOCATION>. The contestants were culled from an estimated 8 million to 9 million competitors nationwide. The final authority for words used in the contest is <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>'s Third New International Dictionary, copyright in 1986, and its addenda section The contest, sponsored by <ORGANIZATION> Scripps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> newspapers </ORGANIZATION>, offers $ 1,500 plus other prizes to the winner, $ 1,000 to the second place finisher, $ 750 for third place, $ 500 for fourth, $ 400 for fifth, $ 300 for sixth, $ 200 each for seventh through 10th, $ 100 for 11th through 20th, and $ 50 to each of the remaining 180 competitors.

 By muting his criticism of Soviet human rights abuses, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> may be trying to speed up negotiations that would substantially cut <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> forces in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who built a political career bashing <ORGANIZATION> Reds </ORGANIZATION> and in his first term called the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> an `` evil empire,'' confounded observers on Tuesday and Wednesday by attributing Kremlin human rights abuses to bureaucratic inertia and praising <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> for trying to reform it. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his aides attributed the softening of the president's rhetoric to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s efforts to reform the system But the answer to the riddle may lie in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s often-stated preference for `` quiet diplomacy'' and the link that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have established between human rights and the professed desired of both sides to reduce conventional arms in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, at the opening of the summit on Sunday night, repeated to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> his 1986 proposal for cuts of 500,000 soldiers in the opposing armies of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> and the Kremlin-led <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION>. Nice idea, said the Americans, but such reductions must come through negotiations involving all the allies on both sides, and the ideal forum is the Conference on Security and Cooperation in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> now under way in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. Those talks grew out of the 1975 <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> Accords, in which the Soviets pledged to observe human rights. For 13 years the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has accused the Kremlin of violating the accords, and Soviet officials are now conceding as much, releasing political prisoners and allowing greater public discussion of formerly taboo subjects. Many Americans, including Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>., D-Ga., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, believe that sharp reductions in conventional forces should accompany the 30 percent to 50 percent cuts in long-range nuclear missiles envisioned in the proposed Strategic Arms Reduction From the American point of view, the main objectives of reducing conventional arms would be a reduction in the 2-to-1 advantage the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact holds on tanks and a reduction in the 380,000 Red Army troops in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Although the edge may have dulled on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s anti-Communist rhetoric, his schedule was designed to emphasize <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concern with human rights: he met with nearly 100 Soviet dissidents at the residence of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> ambassador, he pointedly praised the virtues of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> democracy at every turn, he chatted with with writers, artists and students. And <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials let it be known that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had canceled a meeting with the <PERSON> Zieman </PERSON> family of Jewish refuseniks because a high-ranking <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> official had warned that a visit to their home would kill their application to emigrate. Much of the hardball was being played behind the scenes, said a senior administration official, noting that the American and the Soviet regularly but quietly were engaged in discussion of human rights issues. The president's statements would be hard to explain, unless there was something going on behind the scenes. And his spoken words were particularly puzzling in light of his extra-curricular activities at the summit, which appeared designed to focus attention on Soviet human rights policy, especially the difficulties that Jews face in emigrating. But on Tuesday, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told students at <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> that recalcitrant bureaucrats were to blame for Soviet human rights abuses. And under pointed questioning at a news conference on Wednesday, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said similar problems could be found everywhere. `` I just have to believe that in any sort of government some of us do find ourselves bound in by bureaucracy,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. And after four days of talks with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, he expressed confidence that the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader was trying and would succeed in improving the situation. Soviet human rights activists attributed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s comments on human rights to naivete. `` The bureaucracy has nothing to do with it,'' said <PERSON> Tanya </PERSON> <PERSON> Zieman </PERSON>, whose family had waited in vain for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s visit on Sunday. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his aides may have been calculating that, having made their views known in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, they should tone down the rhetoric in hopes of winning long-sought cuts in Soviet conventional forces in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Elyse </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> tried on her new self-esteem Wednesday and found that it fit just right. `` I've finally done something in my life!'' the 35-year-old mother of four said as her children clung to her long black gown. Seventeen years after she dropped out of college and four years after her husband left her and she went on welfare, <PERSON> Elyse </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> was a college graduate _ and something of a celebrity. At her graduation from <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, she was singled out twice by college officials for her outstanding achievements, which included the highest academic honors _ summa cum laude _ and a straight-A average. She won the <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retirees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scholarship </ORGANIZATION>, the <PERSON> Gertrude </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wertenbaker </PERSON> <PERSON> Scholarship </PERSON> and the Marjorie Anderson Memorial Award. She was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. Her picture was on the front page of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, which called her a `` feisty welfare mom.'' There were offers to appear on morning network news programs. And after commencement ceremonies, while other graduates had their pictures taken by proud mothers and fathers, Ms. <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>'s elated children watched as their mother had her picture taken by legions of newspaper photographers and television cameramen She was asked what it takes for someone to go from the depths of the welfare system to the heights of academic excellence in a few short years. She answered without hesitation. `` Four children pushing you,'' she said. Her children, ages 8 to 17, were pulling at this point. `` C'mon, Mom, it's time for lunch,'' they said. But Ms. <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> was n't through talking. `` When <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Disney </PERSON> won the Academy Award for ` Snow White,' I think he got one big Oscar and seven little ones for the dwarfs,'' she said. `` I feel like I should have four little diplomas for the children.'' She said the children did many of the household chores while she went to school and studied. `` I wanted to graduate and tell my oldest daughter she's not the mother anymore,'' she said. Four years ago, Ms. <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> said, her life had hit bottom. She and her husband had moved from <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, to the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, so he could work for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> _ the distributors of welfare. They found an apartment in a neighborhood she describes as rough and crime-ridden. She had quit her job as an insurance claims adjuster a few years before, and after her son, <PERSON> Damian </PERSON>, was diagnosed as having a learning disability, she decided against going back to work. And then her husband left her, she said. At that point, Ms. <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> said, she realized she had to go onto public assistance _ an experience she is still bitter about. `` It's a system that's designed to keep you down,'' she said `` It's not designed to get you off; it's designed to keep you on.'' After slightly more than a year on welfare, she decided to try going back to school. Her last attempt, at <ORGANIZATION> Hunter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> when she was 17, had been a failure, but she needed to do something to get over `` a sense that I was n't worth anything.'' <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, which is part of the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, accepted her into its Adult Degree Program. It was, she said, `` paradise.'' She declared a double major of English literature and humanities, and she thrived. The program offered work at the college, and she continued to receive welfare payments as well. Now Ms. <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> is heading to the <LOCATION> University </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, where she's received a fellowship to work toward a Ph.D. in English literature. She'll get a $ 17,000 annual stipend plus tuition, and hopes to work part-time as an editor or secretary. Her goal is a teaching position at a `` nontraditional'' college. `` I decided on <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> because I think it will be best for the whole family,'' she said. `` I'm looking forward to a sense of peace ... and goofy stuff like camping and seeing my kids ride bicycles and stuff like that.'' In the meantime, she was asked, does she have any plans? She thought a minute. `` The laundry,'' she said.

<HEAD>Doctors Report Success With Hard-To-Match Kidney Patients</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCIA DUNN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 There is new hope for hundreds of Americans who are being passed over for kidney transplants because old blood tests showed them to be extremely sensitive to donor organs, doctors said Wednesday. `` Transplants can be successfully done'' in these patients as long as the sensitivity tests have turned up negative in the previous six months, said Dr. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Matas </PERSON>, a kidney transplant surgeon at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION>. `` Now you're not penalizing anybody,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Soberman </PERSON>, a nephrologist at <ORGANIZATION> Montefiore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where the study was conducted. <PERSON> Matas </PERSON> reported at the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transplant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physicians </ORGANIZATION> that patients whose blood no longer tests positive for extreme sensitivity to donor organs enjoy just as much success with transplanted kidneys as anyone else. In the past, such patients usually were turned down on the basis of their old sensitivity tests, even if more recent tests show a change, because doctors have been reluctant to waste precious donor kidneys on such patients. About half of the 13,000 people awaiting kidney transplants in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are considered particularly sensitive to transplants because of a previous transplant, pregnancy, blood transfusion or other circumstances that result in an unusually large amount of cytotoxic antibodies in the bloodstream, said Dr. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunsicker </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transplant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physicians </ORGANIZATION>. Until now, the best hope for sensitized patients was to receive a perfectly matched kidney with all six antigens, or genetic markers, identified. Such perfect matches are extremely rare, however. But <PERSON> Matas </PERSON> said that in about a fourth of these sensitized patients, the level of cytotoxic antibodies drops on its own for no known reason. His research concluded that these people do as well with a transplant as those who were never sensitized. From 1983 to 1987, kidney transplants were done on 64 people at <ORGANIZATION> Montefiore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> who had shown sensitivity to transplants at one time but had negative sensitivity tests for at least six months. <PERSON> Matas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Soberman </PERSON> compared their transplant success rates with those of 166 other kidney transplant patients at <LOCATION> Montefiore </LOCATION>, who all had never tested positive for sensitivity. The success rates were about the same. One year after transplantation, 79 percent of the 64 formerly sensitive patients had a properly functioning kidney, as did 77 percent of the regular patients. At three years, the success rates for both groups was around 70 percent. The findings were similar regardless of whether it was a patient's first, second or even third transplanted kidney, <PERSON> Matas </PERSON> said. While such findings can give hope to many people who are forced to exist on dialysis for years, awaiting a transplant, the shortage of donor organs remains a problem for all kidney patients, the experts said. ` The worst part of -LRB- the new study -RRB- is that it only enlarges the pool of people to get kidneys,'' <PERSON> Soberman </PERSON> said. Last year, 8,972 kidney transplants were performed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, down slightly from than the year before, according to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. Early indications are that even fewer kidneys are being offered for transplantation in 1988.

 Their summit business over, President and Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> spent their last night in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> at the <LOCATION> Bolshoi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ballet </LOCATION>, dined privately with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his wife and took an impromptu walk through Red Square. After ballet and a 2 -LCB- - hour dinner Wednesday at a state-owned dacha in a verdant area just outside <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> stopped at Red Square and walked across the cobblestone plaza between St Basil's Cathedral and the Kremlin. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, holding hands with his wife, described his Soviet evening on the town as `` wonderful ... very warm and hospitable.'' He said the couple decided to stop at Red Square `` because <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> has n't seen it. We're leaving tomorrow and I did n't want her to miss it.'' Earlier, the <ORGANIZATION> Gorbachevs </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> shared the royal box in the world-famous Bolshoi Theater for 90 minutes of ballet. Many in the audience of about 2,000 people waved and applauded when they arrived at the opulent red and gold theater, and again before they departed. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> sat next to each other, even moving their seats closer together as the ballet began, and clasped arms around each other's waists briefly as they left the theater. By contrast, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, whose relationship was described by the president's wife as a `` Mexican standoff,'' seemed cool and did not speak. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, dressed in a short white dress and pearls, sat by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s side and Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, wearing blue, sat next to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. It was the first non-political evening the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> have enjoyed in three consecutive days of summitry. The <ORGANIZATION> Gorbachevs </ORGANIZATION> gave a toast-filled state dinner for their guests Monday night, and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> returned the favor with a dinner for the <ORGANIZATION> Gorbachevs </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Spaso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador's residence. The royal box in the Bolshoi Theater was draped with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet flags, and the orchestra played the national anthems of both countries. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> mouthed the words to the American national anthem, and Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> held her hand to her heart. The Reagans both used opera glasses to watch the Bolshoi Ballet perform excerpts from `` Sleeping Beauty,'' `` Swan Lake'' and `` Romeo and <PERSON> Juliet </PERSON>.'' The last was performed by <PERSON> Nine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ananiashvili </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andris </PERSON> <PERSON> Liepa </PERSON>, winners of a 1986 world ballet competition in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, Miss. When it was over, the dancers applauded the superpower leaders from the stage. The Bolshoi Theater, founded in 1776, has six tiers of box seats. It was the first permanent theater in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, and its ballet and opera companies gained an international reputation in the 1950s and 1960s. Tickets cost about three rubles -LRB- $ 5 -RRB- but are nearly impossible for Soviets to obtain without contacts in the theater or luck enough to receive an allocation at their jobs.

<TEXT>
 In the mean, material world of the 44th precinct, hard against the <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tireak </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghandy </PERSON> was stabbed to death at age 12 over his $ 200 bike. That was nine years ago. Sometimes, people get away with murder. Sometimes, everyone walks away, except <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hennessy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, detectives in the self-proclaimed home of the world's busiest cops. `` We're what they call ` off the chart,''' said <PERSON> Hennessy </PERSON>. `` We're not catching cases We're just trying to solve the old ones.'' <PERSON> Hennessy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> and their supervisor, Lieutenant <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephenson </PERSON>, received `` Cop of the Month'' commendations Wednesday for the dogged work that led to an arrest in April in the 1979 slaying of Tireak Ghandy. With their families looking on, the three received the awards and $ 500 each from First Deputy Police Commissioner <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Condon </PERSON>. The statute of limitations never runs out for homicide in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state. Murder cases never die, and the 44th precinct has ones sitting around from 50 years ago. Time heals some old wounds, but this case still lay open and bleeding when the detectives inherited it 2 -LCB- years ago. Partly it was because he was his mother's only child, and his mother, <PERSON> Carol </PERSON>, was a decent, hard-working person. Mostly, it was because he was a child who died the kind of death usually reserved for people who see it coming. `` The kid was doing what every kid who ever grew up in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> did,'' said <PERSON> Hennessy </PERSON>, 49, who grew up in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> and used to do the same when he was <PERSON> Tireak </PERSON>'s age. `` He rode his bike to Yankee Stadium.'' On a warm night at the end of July 1979, <PERSON> Tireak </PERSON> pedaled his new $ 200 10-speed to the stadium, to a place in the back where kids play basketball. He was on his way home when a teen-ager demanded his bike. `` He was a frail little kid,'' <PERSON> Hennessy </PERSON> said. `` This guy was a lot bigger than him. He was four or five years older. He could have smacked the kid in the mouth and taken the bike, that's all he really had to do. He did n't have to stab him.'' But he did stab him, plunging a knife into the smaller boy's chest `` A lot of people heard him yell ` Do n't take my bike!' and starting to scream, right? He was trying to pull the bike away from him, and when the kid would n't give up the bike, he stabbed him,'' <PERSON> Hennessy </PERSON> said. As Tireak fell, the attacker snatched the basketball from his hands and escaped on his bike. The child was bleeding so badly that police did n't wait for an ambulance, but drove him to the hospital themselves. He was dead before they reached the emergency room. `` He was so young and innocent, to lose his life over a basketball and a bicycle,'' said <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, 43, who has a daughter <PERSON> Tireak </PERSON>'s age. `` He did n't have a chance. He just did n't have a chance.'' People saw the killer's face. They left the neighborhood but could n't shake the memory. They remembered, for all the good it did. The police had no leads. `` We asked everyone brought in from that area, and 99 percent of them did n't know anything,'' <PERSON> Hennessy </PERSON> said. About 2 -LCB- years ago, the detectives received some information off the street. Not much, just a fairly common nickname: `` Flaco.'' The thin man. The informant told them the guy who did it had lived two blocks from the scene. The detectives persisted. They came up with a name and a photograph. The next job was to find the witnesses, most of whom had left the area, and persuade them to testify. `` We have witnesses to homicides, if you go back two months from now, they're gone,'' <PERSON> Hennessy </PERSON> said. Most of the murders in the city's most murderous precinct _ a record 81 last year _ are over drugs. Money means more than human life, and civic responsibility smothers under fear. `` Witnesses do n't want to get involved in a neighborhood like this,'' <PERSON> Hennessy </PERSON> said. `` They're afraid. We have people all the time tell us, ` Look, <PERSON> Hennessy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, I'd gladly testify against this guy, and I'd like to see this guy in jail. `` ` But you know what's going to happen: They'll go after my mother or my brother or my wife, and I'm not going to do it.' And you can sympathize with them.'' Mothers see their sons murdered and refuse to testify. Wives see their husbands murdered and free their killers by lying in court. `` That's the kind of thing that makes you mad,'' <PERSON> Hennessy </PERSON> said. They still keep trying. The partners spent a year tracking down the witnesses they knew of and turning up new ones. Most still lived within 25 miles of the crime. In at least one case, they had to travel 200 miles to find the person they wanted. With the witnesses in line, <PERSON> Hennessy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> arrested <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozada </PERSON>, 26, as he visited his parole officer on April 20. <PERSON> Lozada </PERSON>, released from prison last December after serving three years for criminal possession of stolen property, never said a word, but the detectives could see the shock on his face. `` He could n't believe that after all these years, it had caught up with him,'' <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> said. `` I guess he figured he'd beat it.'' Two days later, three witnesses identified <PERSON> Lozada </PERSON> in a lineup as the youth they saw stab Tireak Ghandy to death. He pleaded innocent to charges of second-degree murder and first-degree robbery. A preliminary hearing was held Wednesday in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, but it was adjourned until June 22 to allow the defense to prepare a motion. `` A few of the witnesses felt like, they had lived with this thing so long, and the kid was such a nice kid, and he had such a bad death, we got the feeling these people were really glad _ ` Let me help the cops out and get this thing off my shoulders,''' <PERSON> Hennessy </PERSON> said. Sometimes, people get away with murder. Sometimes, they only think they have. `` We never gave up on it,'' <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> said. `` It was only a matter of time.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is still a threat despite military setbacks and is building a new missile site that threatens the entire <ORGANIZATION> Strait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hormuz </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commander for the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> said Wednesday. Gen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crist </PERSON> said construction of the Silkworm site was one reason for deploying a sophisticated <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Aegis-type missile cruiser in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> with long-range air surveillance and weapons systems. He said the ship is `` a quantum leap forward in our ability to handle that threat'' in <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>, the gulf's narrow gateway. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> remains a formidable presence in the gulf despite losing six naval craft April 18 in clashes with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Crist </PERSON> said. The four-star Marine general heads the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> based in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, administrative headquarters for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military activities in 19 countries of the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> has been `` very circumspect and careful'' since April 18, he said, `` but I do n't get any feeling that the Iranians have run up a white flag or that sort of thing. I would not say they have given up their thoughts about trying to get to us.'' In an interview with members of a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> news media pool on the <PERSON> Coronado </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> flagship in the gulf, <PERSON> Crist </PERSON> also said: _ Military analysts determined `` no enemy missiles'' were launched at three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships in the Strait of <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION> during the fighting April 18, despite reports from shipboad officers that five were fired The confusion resulted from multiple radar contacts of missiles and bombs from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces, `` and what you were getting was hits on the system as they picked up seekers and missiles moving through the air.'' _ A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> H-2 helicopter from the destroyer <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> took `` evasive action'' to avoid a missile fired by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missile frigate <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> `` It obviously was n't hit, so there's a little bit of mystery as to who was firing at what.'' _ Investigators found no evidence that a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> helicopter gunship lost later in the day was shot down, as <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claims `` We do n't know and probably never will'' know the cause of the crash. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, diplomats at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> agreed to hold more <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> talks on ending the gulf war but repeated that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> must be branded the aggressor as the first step toward peace. The diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, provided a copy of a letter from Iranian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, dated Tuesday, stating Iranian conditions. In other developments Wednesday, the death toll rose from one to two in a mine explosion Tuesday that destroyed a fishing boat in the Gulf of <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> off the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said a second vessel was damaged. A net apparently dredged the mine up from the seabed. Shipping executives said six fishermen were injured but it was not known if the second dead man had been included in that total. The mine exploded near a busy tanker anchorage just south of the entrance to <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>, near where Soviet warships and tankers stop and north of the usual staging area for American-flag Kuwaiti tankers and their <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> escorts. <PERSON> Crist </PERSON> said the new Iranian missile site at <LOCATION> Kuhestak </LOCATION>, overlooking central Hormuz, is a fixed installation rather than using mobile launchers as <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has done in the past. He said it might become operational in late summer, `` but that's a guess It could be used anytime. They're building one hell of a big Silkworm site down there, and they've got Silkworms.'' From Kuhestak, all the inner strait and the northern tip of the <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> peninsula would be within the Silkworm range of 50-60 miles. The Silkworm, officially known as the HY-2, is a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> version of the 30-year-old subsonic Soviet Styx. Although crude by modern standards, it can be devastating to ships. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials are on record as saying they would respond with force if any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vessel was fired on or even tracked by a Silkworm battery's radar. There are no signs of work progressing on another suspected Silkworm site, on <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Musa </PERSON> island in the southern Gulf, <PERSON> Crist </PERSON> said. Silkworms on <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Musa </PERSON> would threaten the main gulf shipping lanes and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> coast. `` Clearly we were concerned. So we watched it like a hawk, and nothing happened,'' <PERSON> Crist </PERSON> said. He said assignment of the Aegis-type missile cruiser USS Vincennes to the gulf provides `` a much greater surveillance capability.'' The 9,400-ton vessel arrived during the past week from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. With its state-of-the-art long-range air surveillance radar system `` we can see a lot farther,'' <PERSON> Crist </PERSON> said, and the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> also has `` excellent capability'' against Silkworms. `` So if they decided to use those missiles over there, <PERSON> Aegis </PERSON> really represents a quantum leap forward in our ability to handle that threat,'' he said.

<HEAD>Broadcasters, First Amendment Groups Challenge Rules on Indecency</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A coalition of broadcasters and other First Amendment advocates told a federal appeals court panel Wednesday that the government's rules on indecent broadcasts are unconstitutionally vague. Attorney <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyk </PERSON> said the groups do not challenge the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'s authority to govern indecency on the air, but he said the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s policy does not give broadcasters a clear idea what they can air without fear of sanctions. `` What we would like is some guidance'' on what can be broadcast, he told a panel of three <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> judges. `` Broadcasters do not want to risk their licenses.'' The result of the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s policy has been to chill fully protected speech, <PERSON> Dyk </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> in April 1987 cracked down on indecent broadcasts with a new policy that went beyond simply prohibiting the `` seven dirty words'' that comedian <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlin </PERSON> once used in a radio broadcast. His monologue led to a 1978 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision on indecency. The agency said it would enforce the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s definition of indecency: `` language or material that depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards for the broadcast medium, sexual or excretory activities or organs.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> said broadcasts that fit that definition, and not just programs that used the `` seven dirty words,'' could be subject to sanctions unless the programs were broadcast after midnight, when children were not likely to be in the audience. The policy serves `` the government's compelling and well established interest in protecting children's exposure to salacious material,'' said <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Killory </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> general counsel. <PERSON> Killory </PERSON> said the decision to set aside the early morning hours after midnight as `` safe harbor'' represents `` a balancing of a number of interests'' and `` does n't lend itself to a precise mathematical formula.'' Judge <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s evidence on the number of children in the late-night radio audience appeared to be `` flimsy,'' but <PERSON> Killory </PERSON> countered that `` even with all the resources in the world ... it would still come down to a judgment call.'' <PERSON> Killory </PERSON> said the commission's policy was aimed at helping protect minors from indecent material but was not designed to displace parents as the primary protectors of children. `` It would be unrealistic to assume parents can supervise their children at all hours of the day and night,'' <PERSON> Killory </PERSON> said. Among the groups joining the petition challenging the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s policy are <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cities-ABC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, The <ORGANIZATION> Reporters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and People for the American

 The AIDS virus probably did not jump from monkeys to humans but could have infected the common ancestors of humans and monkeys millions of years ago, researchers say. Japanese biologists who have determined the entire genetic code of the AIDS virus that infects African green monkeys found that the monkey AIDS virus differed from the two known human AIDS viruses. If the virus had jumped from monkeys to humans in recent times, as some have suggested, the viruses would be identical or nearly so. The findings appear in Thursday's issue of the British scientific journal Nature.

 Researchers studying four AIDS-infected men who appeared to stop producing detectable antibodies to the disease said the virus may have stopped reproducing in those patients. Tests to pinpoint AIDS are based upon detection of the antibodies produced by the body to fight the virus. But <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Saah </PERSON>, epidemiology professor at the <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, said the findings do not imply increased dangers of blood supply contamination, since the instances of AIDS victims who stop producing detectable antibodies to the disease are `` very, very rare.''

 An AIDS hotline has expanded from 130 operators to 220 to accommodate a rush of calls generated in part by a government educational pamphlet `` Understanding AIDS'' mailed to 10 million <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> homes, officials said. The 24-hour hotline, 1-800-342-AIDS, offers referrals in English and Spanish for people seeking help in their areas for acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Officials expect 2 million calls in 1988.

 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> committee on AIDS said federal legislation shielding carriers of the virus from discrimination is crucial to fighting the epidemic. The report also said the hundreds of thousands of Americans unknowingly infected with the virus should be considered as suffering from the disease even if they do n't have full-scale AIDS. The panel said there is a growing consensus that `` the vast majority of persons'' with the virus `` will eventually progress to AIDS if no treatment is found to slow or halt the progression of the infection.'' The report called for development of federal standards for labs doing AIDS testing and recommended that AIDS testing be mandatory only in cases involving donations of blood or organs for transplant.

<HEAD>City Meets Most Of Payroll, But Some City Employees Still Waiting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An infusion of state money enabled this financially strapped city to pay most of its 300 workers Wednesday, five days after their paychecks were due, the city's treasurer said But city Treasurer <PERSON> Charlotte </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said unless Mayor <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Officer </PERSON> authorized the transfer of additional funds into the city's general revenue account, about 30 city employees would not get paid for a few days more Officer was in a meeting and could not be reached for comment, his office said. On Wednesday morning, Mrs. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said, the town received its regular quarterly personal property tax payment from the state totaling $ 93,464. The payment supplemented money already on hand and allowed it to meet most of its $ 274,000 bimonthly payroll. But Mrs. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> still was $ 55,000 short of being able to pay all workers. `` We'll pay all police, all firefighters, all public works employees and then we'll go from there,'' she said. The checks were issued early in the afternoon, she said. The remaining employees might have to wait a few days for their paychecks until the city's regular state sales tax payment arrives, she said, unless the mayor authorizes the transfer of motor fuel tax funds into the payroll account, a move that a state official said could jeopardize future state support. Employees in this <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> town of 55,000 were supposed to be paid this past Friday. It was the second time in less than a month that paychecks were delayed. Though Officer could not be reached by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, he told the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-Dispatch </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday that there was enough money in the city's various bank accounts to cover the paychecks _ if the treasurer would cooperate and issue the checks. He did not elaborate. Officer contended that the late paychecks were `` an unfortunate situation that is not necessary'' and blamed Mrs. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, contending that she was angry because her entire staff was laid off in April to help save money. Mrs. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> countered that Officer was upset because she was enforcing sound accounting policies. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Klohr </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION>, said that motor fuel tax funds could be used to pay city employees who do road work but not for other employees. A transfer of motor fuel funds for other workers would violate department guidelines, and the department could withhold future motor fuel tax payments, he said.

<HEAD>Energy Department Forecast On Electricity Demand Doubted</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Energy Department forecasts on demand for electricity are only half as large as they ought to be, a private forecaster said Wednesday. One utility said the industry can easily meet the extra demand the forecaster sees and avoid brownouts by contracting with independent producers for power. But another company said it would be foolish to rely on such a strategy. The two views were presented at a forum for reporters sponsored by Americans for Energy Independence, a group of energy companies and supporters. Already there have been predictions of brownouts by industry groups in the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania-Maryland-New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> area this summer. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> could see similar brownouts now that the state and <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> have agreed not to open the 800-megawatt <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> nuclear plant. The forecaster, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Awareness </ORGANIZATION>, a nuclear industry group, said electricity demand would grow 4 percent this year as manufacturing continues its export-led boom, 4 percent again next year and in 1990 before falling back to 2 percent annual growth. Growth last year was 4.5 percent. The Energy Department originally projected 2 percent growth last year, and in April forecast 2 percent and 2.1 percent growth for this year and next. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON>, director of energy analysis and forecasting for the department, said the department had assumed a slowdown in economic growth this year which is n't going to happen. <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON> commented on <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>'s remarks: `` He has a point, especially in regard to manufacturing. We're going to take a look at this -LRB- for the July forecast -RRB-. `` But 4 percent? He's off his gourd. We may go up, but I do n't see going above 2 -LCB- or 3 percent. In the 1990s, the nation will need to add 135,000 to 210,000 megawatts of generating capacity, <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> said. Current capacity is about 680,000 megawatts, and 11,500 megawatts are scheduled to be installed this year and next. The Energy Department earlier this year said the most likely need in the 1990s is for 55,000 additional megawatts starting in 1992. `` I do n't think the number is all that crucial,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>, chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Dominion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, parent company of <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` The question is, where is that going to come from? First, not much is going to come from utility construction. Second, as much as needed -LRB- will come -RRB- from the competitive sector.'' `` It can be built in time, provided we do n't study it for the next two years,'' <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Beam </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> representative of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest private utility, noted that <ORGANIZATION> AEP </ORGANIZATION> was `` vocally against'' efforts by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to encourage independent producers. <PERSON> Beam </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> AEP </ORGANIZATION> would be `` very much in favor'' of <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>'s strategy if regulators `` could relieve the electric utility industry of its obligation to serve'' all who want to be customers

 Less than a year ago, <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> trudged through the rough terrain of <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, a captive of rebel soldiers. Now, she's giving out food and clothing to desperate people in an urban ministry, in hopes of developing skills to use as a Christian missionary in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The 32-year-old <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> native, who went to <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> to teach English and work as a missionary, says the seven weeks she spent as a hostage are behind, but not forgotten. `` A lot of people do n't have certain freedoms and suffer a great deal. It's one thing to know about it cognitively, but it's another thing to experience a little of it yourself,'' Ms. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said Wednesday. She was kidnapped last July 7. She and her three fellow hostages, including two Americans, were freed seven weeks later thanks to appeals from former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Kenyan governments, Ms. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said. After a 100-mile walk, they arrived safely in <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> on Aug. 25. Ms. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> remembers being roused from sleep in the middle of the night by soldiers who claimed they were `` saving our lives.'' The captors, members of the <ORGANIZATION> Sudanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, planned to attack the village and did not want the three `` caught in the cross-fire,'' Ms. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said. The Sudanese rebels have waged a five-year civil war against the government, which is dominated by Moslems from the predominantly <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> northern section of the country. The Sudanese <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> is fighting for government reforms and autonomy for <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s three southern provinces, where most people are Christian or animist. After packing malaria medicine, some first-aid supplies, a Bible and a few other belongings, Ms. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> was led out of the house she was living in at <ORGANIZATION> Bishop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gwynne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> near the southern Sudanese town of <LOCATION> Mundri </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said she and three other hostages were forced to walk through the countryside of <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, the largest country in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. They slept on the side of the road or in rebel camps, ate sporadically, drank bad water and trudged through waterways, she recalled. `` Certain aspects of the physical parts were hard _ long walks and bad water,'' she said. `` But the psychological parts were hard, too ... not knowing how long we would be kept, not knowing what each day was going to bring.'' In October, Ms. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to work with the <ORGANIZATION> Circle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION> providing emergency food, clothing and housing to poor people in the <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> neighborhood on the city's rough <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> Ms. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said she and four friends are volunteering in the urban mission as preparation for a missionary project they've been planning for more than a decade. The five _ a nurse, an architect, two teachers and a businessman-aviation mechanic _ plan to leave for <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> after another year of training and language classes in Spanish. `` Our commitment to the Lord is the underlying thing,'' she said. `` Everything is n't rosy, but there's a commitment underneath it _ ours is strong.'' Ms. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Johnson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, said in a telephone interview Wednesday that the first thing her daughter wanted to do when she got home was eat broccoli. `` We really expected her to be different, but she was the same old <PERSON> Katie </PERSON>,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said.

 Tear gas fired by soldiers into enclosed spaces has killed 11 Arabs in the occupied territories, including a 7-day-old infant, and caused dozens of miscarriages, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official said Wednesday. Col. <PERSON> Ranaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON>, a military spokesman, said the statement was based on `` unfounded rumors'' and the army could not check it because no details of the casualties were provided. Also Wednesday, a 12-year-old boy was killed when he and other youngsters in <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> tried to dismantle an army roadblock made of oil drums and a drum struck him in the head, the army said. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> discussed political issues Wednesday night with four prominent Palestinians in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, his third such meeting in a week, a defense official said. Authorities would not give the names of Palestinians who participated, saying their lives might be endangered. Several prominent <PERSON> Gaza </PERSON> <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> said they were not invited, including former Mayor <PERSON> Rashad </PERSON> <PERSON> Shawwa </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and lawyer <PERSON> Faiz </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahme </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON> said `` medical tests show tear gas can only cause temporary disablement, never death,'' and the miscarriages resulted from increased blood pressure after women took part in violent protests, not from tear gas. <PERSON> Burl </PERSON> <PERSON> Alison </PERSON>, a vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Transtechnology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Sherman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oaks </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, which supplied tear gas to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, has said the gas is safe when used properly but can cause death if high doses are fired into enclosed areas. <ORGANIZATION> Transtechnology </ORGANIZATION>'s gas canisters carry a warning not to use it in enclosed spaces. It stopped selling to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> last month, citing concern about improper use. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> figures say hospitals have treated 1,285 Palestinians for breathing problems since a rebellion against Israeli occupation began Dec. 8 among the 1.5 million Palestinians of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said the report about tear gas was `` a matter of concern to us. We have repeatedly urged the government of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to use non-lethal means to control violent demonstratons.'' Before the latest death, the army said 207 Palestinians had been killed in the six months of violence. An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier and a Jewish settler also have been slain. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, spokesman for the U.N. Relief and <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which cares for Palestinian refugees, said tear gas had killed 11 Arabs in the territories. He said most casualties from tear gas occurred when soldiers fired it into rooms of clinics, homes and schools while dispersing protesters. `` The gas is not normally lethal when used according to prescribed directions, but it can be when fired into closed spaces,'' he said in an interview. In other developments, 22 Palestinian employees of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> military administration's auto-licensing department resigned Wednesday. Underground leaders of the uprising demanded they quit to protest a requirement that Arabs pay their taxes before they can obtain driving or building permits. Police determined that an army private broke regulations by taking two teen-age members of a paramilitary training group into a detention center near <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> last month, where one youth clubbed an Arab prisoner, the army reported. It said the soldier would be reprimanded. According to the daily <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION>, police also will charge Rabbi <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Levinger </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, a leader of Jewish settlers, with attacking an <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> family. An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> reserve soldier filed a complaint against <PERSON> Levinger </PERSON> accusing hin of breaking into the home of <PERSON> Ishak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON>, grabbing <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON>'s daughter by the throat and beating his wife on the back, the paper said. <PERSON> Levinger </PERSON> told the paper the girl shouted insults at the rabbi's 13-year-old daughter in the street According to <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, doctors at <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> clinics said the 11 tear gas fatalities were recorded through April. He said most were infants, one only 7 days old, or people over 65. `` The people on this list are those doctors believe would n't have died at that particular time if it were n't for tear gas being fired,'' he said `` That's my bottom-line criteria.'' Among the victims was a 35-year-old woman in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> who died along with her unborn child after going into labor prematurely as a result of inhaling tear gas, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> representative said. He said the gas apparently causes muscle spasms that can cause miscarriage, and dozens of such cases have been reported. The army spokesman, <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON>, countered: `` According to doctors, not just <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> doctors, when pregnant women participate in riots their blood pressure goes up and they have miscarriages caused by overexcitement, not by tear gas.'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said most victims of miscarriages were n't involved in protests, but were `` at home when tear gas was fired into their homes, into a closed confined space.'' <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON> said soldiers fire the gas into closed quarters only in rare accidents. `` There is no intentional policy to fire into closed quarters,'' he said. `` It may happen that a gas canister can hit a window and fall into a house, but one canister can not cause such results.'' He said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> issued its statement `` without checking the facts'' and had been `` manipulated'' by the media.

 Under the glare of chandeliers and television lights, 200 youngsters spelled their way through `` nainsook,'' `` univocal'' and other exotic words Wednesday in the 61st annual National Spelling Bee. At the end of the third round that wrapped up the day's activities, 485 words had been spelled, or misspelled, and 144 contestants remained in competition in a hotel ballroom `` Now when I go back home, I'll never hear the end of it, because I told everyone I was going to win,'' said <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, 13, of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> ` I'm going to try next year.'' She was eliminated in the second round for spelling thuggery with only one `` g.'' The competitors ranged in age from 8 to 14 and, in dress, from shorts and blue jeans to ties and party dresses. One girl, <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Shieh </PERSON>, 13, of <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, wearing a cardboard crown from a fast food restaurant, looked puzzled by her assignment: `` foozled,'' meaning bungled. `` Does this word have an origin?,'' she asked. `` Perhaps,'' replied pronouncer <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON>, an English professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dayton </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> spelled it right. Two of <PERSON> Judy </PERSON>'s sisters have been spelling champions and participated in national bees. But <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> brought her own brand of showmanship this year _ a different hat for each round, a lucky toothbrush hanging around her neck and a magic bracelet around her wrist. `` I'm the first'' to wear the hats, she said. She correctly spelled `` flagitiously,'' meaning scandalously, in the third round, wearing <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouse </PERSON> ears. The contestants came from diverse backgrounds, some the children of professors, doctors and engineers, others the offspring of restaurant and farm workers, custodians and bus drivers. Some were so shy their voices were barely audible; others adjusted their microphones, demanded definitions and boomed their answers with supreme confidence. One boy, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>, 11, of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, clutched his stomach in pain as he approached the microphone, escorted by his grandfather and a spelling bee official. ` E-n-t-o-u-r-a-g-e! ` he exclaimed and, still bent over, headed for a comfort room stocked with Cokes, couches and consolers. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> was still in contention at the end of the day, correctly spelling `` utilitarian'' as he leaned on his grandfather's arm. The words in the opening rounds included commonplaces such as comply, calcium and barnyard. They were followed later by less-familiar terms such as nainsook, a thin, lightweight cotton fabric; and univocal, or unambiguous. <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> said the slow attrition rate was bound to accelerate Thursday, the final day of the event, when the survivors were scheduled to tackle words not included in a book they had been given to study. `` There will be a big difference in the mortality rate,'' he said. The first casualty of the spelling bee was <PERSON> Monekia </PERSON> <PERSON> Gause </PERSON>, 11, of <LOCATION> Shallotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> ` I never heard it before, ` she said tearfully after spelling `` jargon'' with an `` i'' instead of an `` o.'' Monekia and the others eliminated on Day One were not the only ones who made mistakes. A list of correct spellings distributed by spelling bee officials showed `` hitchhiker'' with one `` h'' in the middle instead of two. `` It was a typing error,'' explained <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a bee spokeswoman. The winner of the bee receives $ 1,500 and other prizes. Second prize is $ 1,000, third is $ 750, fourth is $ 500, fifth is $ 400, sixth is $ 300, seventh through 10th is $ 200, 11th through 20th is $ 100 and the remaining 180 are $ 50. The bee is sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Scripps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> newspaper group.

<HEAD>Train Collision Kills 2, Hurts 29 in Netherlands</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UTRECHT, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A passenger express train going more than 70 mph rear-ended a sitting freight train Wednesday, killing two people and injuring as many as 29, a Dutch railway spokesman said. The four-car passenger train carrying about 60 passengers derailed and tumbled down an embankment after hitting the gravel-laden train in southwestern <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> at about 10:40 a.m., said spokesman <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Meijer </PERSON>. He said the 39-year-old locomotive engineer of the passenger train was killed, as was a 79-year-old Dutch woman, identified as <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sitter </PERSON>. <PERSON> Meijer </PERSON> said nine people were hospitalized, two in critical condition, and up to 20 others were treated for minor injuries. The lead passenger car was left with one end sticking up in the air, <PERSON> Meijer </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview from the railway's head office in this central Dutch city. He said the cause of the collision was not immediately known. The passenger train traveling at about 74 mph was bound from <LOCATION> Roosendaal </LOCATION>, a major junction in the southern <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> about 60 miles south of <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>, to <PERSON> Vlissingen </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Zeeland </LOCATION> province, the railway spokesman said. Visibility was good at the site of the accident between the stations of <LOCATION> Rilland-Bath </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Krabbendijke </PERSON>, where the double-track Roosendaal-Vlissingen main line runs in a slight bend, according to <PERSON> Meijer </PERSON>. He said the freight train was being used to try out a new energy conservation method and the gravel cars were hooked up to the electric engine as a simulated payload. The train was supposed to start and stop three times, he said, adding that it was not clear `` why the engineer of the passenger train did n't see it, or whether the signals failed.'' The line has an automatic signaling system, according to the spokesman. Wreckage blocked both tracks and considerable damage was done, <PERSON> Meijer </PERSON> said.

 Thousands of marchers in <LOCATION> Wroclaw </LOCATION> chanted for a `` Revolution of the Dwarfs'' and likened <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s leader to an evil dragon Wednesday in a satirical observance of Child's Day, opposition spokesmen said. `` We know nothing about it,'' said a police headquarters spokesman in the southwestern city when asked for comment about the public needling of Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>. Parents and grandparents give small gifts to children on Child's Day, which is observed in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> each June 1 The Wroclaw march and rally was organized by Orange Alternative, an opposition street theater group that stages frequent `` happenings'' lampooning the government. More than 10,000 people took part, said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Labuda </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the banned Solidarity trade union in the city, and <PERSON> Krzysztof </PERSON> <PERSON> Albin </PERSON> of Orange Alternative. They spoke by telephone from <LOCATION> Wroclaw </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Albin </PERSON> said the main slogan was a call for a fairy-tale `` Revolution of the Dwarfs.'' He said marchers also chanted `` <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, dragon of Wawel,'' referring to the dragon once said to live under <ORGANIZATION> Wawel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Castle </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>, and `` We want a jester instead of little Wojciech.'' Included in the chants were rhyming parodies of old Solidarity anti-government slogans, <PERSON> Albin </PERSON> said. Marchers walked from the central market to a square about 15 blocks away, then another 15 blocks to a park on an island in the <LOCATION> Odra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, he said, with some people painting slogans on walls and a police van en route.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s `` flexible freeze'' plan to end the federal budget deficit by 1993 depends on an optimistic outlook and a reduction in interest rates by at least 2 percentage points, his economic advisers said Wednesday. `` We all concluded that a flexible freeze is the right way to go, that is indeed doable,'' said former Deputy Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ended four days of private talks with <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leaders and advisers at his seaside vacation retreat. <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would contrast his plan to the `` <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> mirage'' of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, a slap at the Democratic front-runner's references to a `` <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> miracle'' of home-state revival while he has been governor. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan also depends on a reduction in the budget deficit that is occurring anyway and a fast-rising surplus in the nation's Social Security trust fund, the consultants said The vice president has said he would reduce the deficit by the end of a first term by freezing most spending and without raising any taxes. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldstein </PERSON>, who quit his job as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s chief economist in 1985 because his advocacy of a tax increase was at odds with White House policy, told reporters he was a convert to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposal. If <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is elected, financial markets will rally on the assumption that the deficit will be attacked seriously, <PERSON> Feldstein </PERSON> suggested. `` The markets will respond and bring down interest rates another notch, 2 percentage points, and that will get us down and get us within inches of budget balance in 1993,'' said <PERSON> Feldstein </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> economist. However, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s declarations that he would reject the advice of a bipartisan commission studying the federal deficit if it should call for a tax increase drew skepticism on Wednesday from one of those he met with, Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Frenzel </PERSON>. <PERSON> Frenzel </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> Republican and a member of the blue-ribbon panel, said the commission's work would not be swayed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s comments `` We are not going to get involved in any presidential campaigns,'' <PERSON> Frenzel </PERSON> told reporters during a picture-taking session Wednesday with the vice president. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> interrupted <PERSON> Frenzel </PERSON> at one point, saying: `` I hope the commission listens a little bit to the American people in this election.'' `` That's what I think an election is about. The commission can take an objective look and come up with whatever it wants. I'd be much more persuaded by what the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people say.'' The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, made up of appointees of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration as well as members of both parties in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, was formed earlier this year to try to come up with a bipartisan package of deficit-reduction proposals. The panel, which will also include two members appointed by the new president-elect in November, will submit its report in 1989. Democratic critics, as well as many private economists, argue that it is unlikely the budget deficit, $ 150 billion last year, can be eliminated without some form of new taxes. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal calls for a `` flexible freeze'' that would keep overall spending except for Social Security payments at levels in the budget approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for fiscal year 1989, plus inflation. The freeze would be flexible because some spending could go up, but increases would have to be offset by identical reductions in other areas. So far, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has not provided details on which programs he would like to cut and which ones he would like to see expanded. The vice president, who has clinched the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nomination, has also proposed a reduction in the tax on capital gains _ profits from the sale of real estate, stocks or other assets _ to 15 percent from its current maximum of 28 percent. Many economists have suggested that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposals would not go far enough in trimming the budget deficit. `` I'm not surprised that the Democrats would say that,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` All they want to do is spend and tax. There is no change I can see or hear out of the campaign that would lead you to believe anything other than that on the Democratic side.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> held two days of talks on economic issues on Tuesday and Wednesday. They followed similar discussions with outside advisers last Friday and Saturday on other domestic issues. He has been at his retreat overlooking the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> since last Thursday and will remain here until Friday, combining strategy and issues sessions with a vacation. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that the economists who advised him assured him that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy was strong. On Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that the Index of Leading Indicators, a major guage of the country's economic health, was up in April for the third consecutive month. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that none of the half dozen private economists visiting him foresaw a recession in the coming months. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> who has frequently trumpted the 65-month economic expansion as a sign of success for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> economic policies _ policies he derided in 1980 as `` voodoo economics'' _ cautioned the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday not to do anything that would jeopardize that expansion.

 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> concluded their fourth summit Wednesday in conflict on arms control and human rights, but still satisfied that their new relationship had eliminated `` evil empire'' from the superpowers' vocabulary. They hailed the progress they achieved in what was probably their final summit sessions, but <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> grumbled about <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s attempts to change Soviet policy toward dissidents and refuseniks _ those denied visas and punished for seeking them <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said that he told <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` your words are not convincing'' when the president tried to persuade him to modify Soviet policy and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, speaking later, abandoned that tack. The president said bureaucracy _ not willful <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> policy _ may be responsible for baring thousands of Jews and others from leaving the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` I just have to believe that in any government some of us do find ourselves bound in by bureaucracy,'' he told a windup news conference in the ballroom of <LOCATION> Spasso </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> home of American ambassadors. The <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> leave Thursday for a day in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> en route home. His summit work over, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> strolled hand-in-hand with wife <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> in the moonlight through Red Square at midnight after a night out on the town with the <LOCATION> Gorbachevs </LOCATION>. Their motorcade stopped between St. Basil's cathedral and the russet walls of the ancient fortress. About 1,000 onlookers were held back as the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> took in the scene and walked across the cobblestone plaza. If the leaders put new warmth in their relationship, their wives did not. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> engaged in a feisty competition for the press' attention with Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> cutting in at one point while Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was talking. Said the first lady, `` I want to say something; I want to say something, OK?'' Mrs. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> fell silent. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> characterized their relationship as `` a Mexican standoff'' _ a tie. A satisfied <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> held a 110-minute news conference _ his first ever on <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> soil _ and called the summit `` a blow to the foundations of the Cold War.'' For his part, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said again that his characterization of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as `` the evil empire'' no longer applies. The Reagans and <PERSON> Gorbachevs </PERSON> got together Wednesday night to take in the <ORGANIZATION> Bolshoi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ballet </ORGANIZATION> then shared a private moment over a cozy dinner at a government-owned dacha outside <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. At the ballet, many in the audience of about 2,000 people waved and applauded when they arrived at the opulent red and gold theater and again before they departed. The first ladies did not speak to one another. The human rights issue took an odd turn in back-to-back news conferences that followed the final summit talks. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said he was `` not filled with admiration at this aspect of the visit,'' referring to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s meetings with Soviet dissidents and refuseniks. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> dropped his cudgel, suggesting that Soviet failure to allow free emigration might stem more from bureaucratic problems than Kremlin policy. `` A great deal is due to the General Secretary,'' the president said of his remarkably softer tone toward the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>. The statement raised eyebrows among several refuseniks, including <PERSON> Tanya </PERSON> <PERSON> Zieman </PERSON> who has been waiting 11 years to gain an exit visa. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, at his own news conference, said the two leaders, in what will be their final summit unless the remaining arms impasses are bridged by negotiators in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, `` have freed themselves from all sorts of propaganda gambits.'' In fact, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` I'm going to do everything I can to persuade my successor to follow up and continue'' the policy of reconciliation. There was no palpable optimism that an offensive weapons pact can be reached in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s term, but both leaders pledged to try. `` The first lines have already been written into a book of the world without nuclear weapons,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said upon exchanging finals papers the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty, a lesser arms accord that was completed at the 1987 summit. `` ... I do n't think anyone can close the book on that and put it aside,'' he said. In remarks after a ceremony punctuated with smiles and handshakes, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had disavowed his description of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as an `` evil empire.'' With satisfaction, he said: `` Somebody asked the president whether he still considered the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to be an ` evil empire.' He said no, and he said that within the walls of the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, next to the czars gun, right in the heart of that evil empire. We take note of that,'' he said. `` As the ancient Greeks say, everything flows, everything changes. Everything is in a state of flux.'' It was once hoped that this week's summit would be crowned by an agreement to slash long-range nuclear weapons 30 to 50 percent. Instead, the leaders deadlocked on the accord and instead exchanged final papers on the treaty eliminating intermediate-range nuclear weapons. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowny </PERSON>, a senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms control adviser, said `` we did n't get anywhere on sea-launched cruise missiles, we did not get anywhere on the SDI-ABM problem.'' He referred to a disagreement over how to monitor cruise missiles carried on warships and on the link the Soviets have made between the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION> and the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. The two disputes are the key obstacles to completing the treaty. The SDI program, which seeks a space-based defense against Soviet ballistic missiles, will involve technology tests that the Soviets say threaten the 1972 treaty. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Tuesday `` it's never been part of the negotiations.'' On the other hand, a joint communique issued at the end of the formal talks said `` common ground'' had been reached during the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit on verifying mobile missiles and cruises carried by airplanes. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet negotiators were instructed to `` record these gains'' in the text of the START treaty when they return to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on July 12 from a six-week vacation. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> eased off his criticism of the Soviets apparently because he expects favorable action on the 14 human rights cases he presented in a list to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Instead of condemning the communist system, he chided bureaucracy.

<HEAD>Reagan's Remarks On Homeless Cause Controversy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Advocates for the homeless Wednesday criticized President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s remarks at a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> news conference defending the nation's treatment of the homeless by citing the case of a street woman who fought <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s efforts to hospitalize her. They said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> inaccurately described the case of <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, the homeless woman who waged the much-publicized battle against the city. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s remarks came in response to a reporter's suggestion that Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was not convinced by the president's statements that serious human rights deficiencies did not exist in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. He said he wished <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> would visit the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> long enough to correct the `` mistaken view about the things that occasionally dominate the press, about prejudice, racial or religious, in our country, about people, the so-called street people who apparently have no place to live.'' `` But I do n't think he quite could understand a recent situation: a young lady living on the sidewalks of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, living out there on the sidewalk, winter and summer, and so for her own sake, the police picked her up to bring her to where she could be placed in a shelter and she took her case to court and won her case in court that she should be allowed to go back and sleep on the sidewalk where she had been because that's what she preferred to do. `` Well, when you have a free country, how far can we go in impinging on the freedom of someone who says this is the way I want to live? I think we could straighten him out if he saw what we did in our country.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, also known as <PERSON> Billie </PERSON> <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON>, was taken off Second Avenue in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> last year under a city program regarding mentally disturbed street people. Homeless who are believed to threaten the safety of others or themselves are taken off the streets and put in a special ward of <ORGANIZATION> Bellevue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. They are not taken to a shelter, as the president said. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, it was alleged, defecated on the street, shouted at passers-by and burned money that was given to her. A judge ruled that <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> was competent to decide where she should live. On appeal, she was found to be incompetent, but was released when another judge found that the city could not force her to take medication. She has not returned to the streets, but is receiving disability payments and living at a private shelter for the homeless. `` Although I have my freedom, I still do not have adequate housing. Why does n't the president assist me in getting permanent housing?'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said in response to the president's remarks, according to <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>, her attorney and executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. He said she was `` hoping someone from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would call and help her find an apartment.'' <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s case showed that `` the system was forced to work to protect her right to individual liberty, but it also served -LRB- to show -RRB- in a broader context of the failure to provide adequate housing.'' `` Today, in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, there are thousands of homeless on the streets'' and he attributed it to `` the failure of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to provide meaningful programs.'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, president of the Partnership for the Homeless, which operates shelters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and elsewhere, also decried <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s comments. `` The president's statement ... suggesting that the shameful problem of growing homelessness in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is the result of what he referred to as ` street people' who are homeless by choice totally ignores the fact that the vast majority of homelessness has been caused by his own policies which have gutted the principal federal programs to provide affordable housing for low-income and moderate-income people,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` The most authoritative national survey of 47 of our largest cities shows that less than 7 percent of the homeless are so by choice and most homeless are members of families who simply can not find affordable housing.'' <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrahams </PERSON>, associate director of the Coalition for the Homeless in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, agreed that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had misrepresented the homeless problem. Many of the homeless are families, he said; he estimated there were 750,000 homeless children, and their average age is 6. `` If Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was to visit this country, he would n't be here long before he saw homeless people. He would see them at <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, where he might arrive; he would see them living across the street from the <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION>, where he would be greeted,'' <PERSON> Abrahams </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>NBC President Warns Broadcast Rules Hampering Networks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Government regulation is hobbling the three major television broadcast networks in the face of unregulated competition from the cable industry, the president of top-rated <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. `` Given the economics of the network business today, the depressing fact is that you have to be the first-place network to keep your head above water, because second - or third-place does n't do it for you anymore,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said in a speech to representatives of the cable and broadcast `` And without some new sources of income, the future of the networks, to put it charitably, is uncertain,'' he said. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, the prime-time leader, is in a better financial position than <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> because of `` a few more hit shows than the other guys have and a gentleman named <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON>, who can not be expected to carry us over the top forever.'' The Cosby Show is one of TV's top-rated shows. The <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> president said the networks are being hamstrung by outdated federal regulations that bar the networks from having a financial interest in programs produced by others and limit what they can produce themselves. The government also prohibits the networks from owning cable systems, syndicating programs domestically and sharing in the profits of syndication of shows produced by network-owned stations. Supplying cable programming and operating cable networks are two of the few opportunities available to the networks to broaden their business bases, he said. `` We can do in cable what we ca n't do in broadcasting,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> told reporters after his speech. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> last month announced that it had agreed to buy the <ORGANIZATION> Tempo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> cable channel from <ORGANIZATION> Tele-Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and use it to launch two new cable services. The services _ a sports-programming network and a business-news service _ will rely on the resources of NBC News and NBC Sports. <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cities-ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> also has stepped into the cable arena, with ownership of <ORGANIZATION> ESPN </ORGANIZATION>. `` The fresh breeze of deregulation has n't blown much over the networks. We've felt very little benefit,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. `` The network rules still stand like an aging colosseum. We're inside looking over the walls at the young lions who have been set free to enjoy an open marketplace.''

<HEAD>Hutton Investigator Says He Couldn't Find Guilt in Top Management</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Former Attorney General <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> testified Wednesday that his private investigation of check kiting at <PERSON> E.F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> did n't fault senior management because he could n't find evidence of wrongdoing at the top. <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, sued for defamation for identifying a former <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> branch manager as a wrongdoer in a 1985 report, stoutly defended the investigation his <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> law firm conducted after <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> pleaded guilty to 2,000 mail and wire fraud charges. `` I thought I could catch a high person, but I never could,'' <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> said. Though he was suspicious that top officials were aware of illegal overdrafting practices, <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> said he found no evidence of intentional wrongdoing by senior executives. `` I'm not going to put my name on something charging somebody with wrongdoing if they ... did not have the intent to do something wrong,'' <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> testified in the federal court trial of the case brought by former <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> branch manager <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearce </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pearce </PERSON>, now a <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, businessman, claims <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> negligently ignored evidence that cash management practices that led to <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON>'s guilty plea were approved by top executives. <PERSON> Pearce </PERSON>, who ran <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> branches in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, alleges that <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>'s report put false blame on him and the eight other branch and regional officials who were identified as initiating illegal overdrafting. But <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> Pearce </PERSON> `` never told me that anybody authorized him to do that.'' `` I asked him about paying a penalty. He said he did n't think he should have to pay a penalty because he was a manager and not an account executive.'' The former attorney general quoted <PERSON> Pearce </PERSON> as saying: `` Why do n't you take it out of my bonus. <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, a senior partner at the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> law firm of <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Spalding </PERSON>, was hired by <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> to conduct the investigation after the brokerage firm pleaded guilty to the charges on May 2, 1985. His report was issued on Sept. 4, 1985. <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON>, now part of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, agreed to pay a $ 2 million fine and reimburse banks for interest lost on checks written for amounts greater than funds it kept in its checking accounts. The company also agreed to stop certain cash management practices that investigators said gained <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> as much as $ 250 million a day in interest-free loans. <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> said that when he had trouble getting documents from the company's law firm, he visited <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fomon </PERSON> to get the material for his investigation. `` I told him there was going to be an historical marker in front of the <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> building saying: ` This is where the company was. They lost the company because their lawyers were claiming attorney-client privilege.''' <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> said. `` At that point I started getting documents,'' said <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, a former federal appellate judge who also served as President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s first attorney general. Although <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> did not find wrongdoing by top managers, he faulted senior executives for not properly monitoring the cash management procedures being followed at lower levels in the company. `` They did n't have any controls at all,'' <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> testified. The company was `` just letting people go wild, doing whatever they wanted to do.'' The report recommended that <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morley </PERSON>, the `` money mobilizer'' who devised aggressive cash management systems, be relieved of any duties involving <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON>'s banking activities. `` Everybody disowned Mr. <PERSON> Morley </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> said. `` Nobody owned up that they had anything to do with him.'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>, executive vice president, was identified in the investigation as the company's chief financial officer and forced to resign for failing to maintain proper controls. <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> said his investigation had trouble identifying which top executive ultimately was responsible for the firm's financial procedures because `` nobody wanted to be known as the chief financial officer.'' Many overdrafting procedures used by large companies, including <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON>, are legal because the banks are aware of them, <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> said. But he conceded in questioning by <PERSON> Pearce </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Milliken </PERSON>, that in the case of many <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> accounts, `` most banks, or many banks, did not know what was happening to them.'' `` My best information was they did not tell the banks, except in a few instances'' <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Army Makes Premature Finding Against Radio Wave Interference As
Crash Cause</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Army appears to have `` prematurely'' ruled out the possibility that radio wave interference can cause its new UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter to crash, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s inspector general said Wednesday. The inspector general, in a long-awaited 25-page report, said laboratory and field testing had established that high levels of electro-magnetic energy _ such as radio or radar transmissions _ can affect the flight control systems of the Blackhawk. The question, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s independent auditor continued, is whether such radio interference can become severe enough to cause one of the choppers to crash. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> `` has determined that electro-magnetic interference is not a safety of flight issue,'' the inspector general noted. `` But the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> seems to have taken a different position. `` It stated that while electro-magnetic interference has not been demonstrated to be a safety of flight issue, it has not been definitively ruled out ... We agree with the position of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> that test data available to date are not sufficiently conclusive ... `` A negative safety of flight determination ... has been made prematurely.'' The audit report also went on to criticize the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s handling of the problem, disclosing:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 _ Army investigators have never identified electro-magnetic interference `` as a cause of, or even a contributing factor in, any accident in the aircraft reviewed. _ The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> has been slow in addressing the Blackhawk's problems with radio interference and is now pursuing a questionable approach to solving the matter Most of the testing to date has involved only simulated conditions, and the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> appears to be planning assembly line improvements that would address only those problems that have cropped up to date. `` Thus, the Army appears to be concentrating on the symptom and ignoring the illness,'' the auditors wrote. `` Testing has not been sufficient or timely.'' _ The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> could have obtained detailed technical and cost information on what it takes to harden the Blackhawk's systems against radio interference from the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> two years ago _ but failed to do so The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, which uses a variant known as the SH-60 Seahawk, has specified a level of protection against interference that is 10 times greater than the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s, the auditors said. The release of the inspector general's report comes just a week after the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> announced it was accelerating plans to shield one key control system of the Blackhawk against interference. Maj. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Soucy </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the service intended to study the new report closely but he disputed some of the report's conclusions `` The report implies that we have been suppressing recommendations from the safety center,'' <PERSON> Soucy </PERSON> said. `` Our approach to this has been anything but cavalier. The director of the safety center has supported our approach and we have moved as expeditiously as the evidence allowed. And any suggestion the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> is placing dollars in front of safety is a gross error.'' The Blackhawk is a twin-engine, single-rotor helicopter that is replacing the aging UH-1 <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> copters of the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> era as the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s primary air assault and air cavalry craft. Last November, <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION> reported investigators were convinced radio wave interference had caused five Blackhawk accidents since 1982, killing 22 servicemen. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and the aircraft's maker, the <ORGANIZATION> Sikorsky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> unit of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, denied that report.

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 377-5 on Wednesday for a bill that would authorize money for juvenile delinquency, runaway youth and missing children.

Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> reaffirmed his opposition to tax hikes. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also said in a private meeting with fund-raisers that he would consider `` geographical balance'' in deciding his vice presidential running mate and would look for someone with a `` substantive background that supplements my own,'' according to one person who attended the session. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor has come under pressure from some Democats to select a running mate from the West or the South to provide geographical balance to the ticket. He frequently has been advised to pick someone with greater experience in foreign policy and defense matters than he has accumulated in 10 years in the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Statehouse </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, nearing the end of his remarkable, but losing, primary campaign, walked along a garbage-strewn beach in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and called on corporations and the federal government to take a more active role in fighting pollution. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is expected to clinch the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nomination next week when the final primary elections of the Democratic campaign are held in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Both <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> worked Wednesday at unifying their parties for what both sides predict will be a tense, tight fall election. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor enlisted the support of nearly 30 Democratic National Convention delegates, many of whom earlier supported dropout candidate <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> Jr.. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also met over breakfast with fund-raisers for <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> as part of his campaign's effort to help raise $ 50 million for use by the national and state parties in the fall campaign <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign _ which sewed up the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nomination several weeks ago _ showed off a little unity of its own when Sen. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Grassley </PERSON> and Gov. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> formally announced their decision to head the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> effort in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. `` We know it wo n't be easy'' to carry the state, said <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON>. `` But it can be done.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> finished third in the state's caucuses in February, with <PERSON> Grassley </PERSON> backing the winner, Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> professing neutrality. As the long primary season was coming to a close, a candidate from the past _ former Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> _ announced his fourth try for the presidency. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, whose 1968 candidacy was a rallying point for Americans opposed to the Vietnam War, said he was running on the Consumer Party ticket. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, speaking to reporters and about 100 tourists near Independence Hall in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, said he sees no real choice between the Democratic and Republican candidates. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was at his oceanside home in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, where he has been meeting with economists and other outside advisers for the past several days. The vice president looked on as Republican Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Frenzel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, a supporter who is also a member of a bipartisan deficit-reduction commission, expressed skepticism over <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign pledge to reject any tax-raising proposal the group might come up with `` That's what I think an election is about,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` The commission can take an objective look and come up with whatever it wants. I'd be much more persuaded by what the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people say.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also took a swipe at Democrats, saying, `` All they want to do is tax and spend. There is no change I can see or hear out of that campaign that would lead you to believe anything other than that on the Democratic side.'' Former Deputy Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, who was among the advisers meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Wednesday, took a slap at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' fiscal policies. The economic boom in <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' state is frequently referred to by the governor as the `` <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> miracle.'' <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> called it the `` <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> mirage.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> spent much of his day in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> before flying to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> for the final few days of his primary candidacy. He stepped over broken glass, plastic bottles, fast-food containers and other debris as he walked along a once-popular resort beach to dramatize his call for environmental cleanup. `` If the Russians were poisoning our air, if they were dumping sludge in the water, if they were killing fish, we would call that chemical warfare and we would negotiate tough,'' he said. But campaign rhetoric aside, the final days of the Democratic primary campaign were taking on the appearance of an elaborate public and private negotiation between <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> over the party's vice presidential candidate and national convention. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said Tuesday that he had earned consideration for the vice presidential nomination, and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said emphatically on Wednesday that he agreed. `` He's somebody who's done a remarkable job, has great gifts and great strengths,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` I respect and admire him a lot.'' But asked if <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> deserves special consideration to be on the ticket, he said, `` No.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spent most of his day in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, where he called for the creation of a new national student loan program that would ensure repayment through payroll deductions. `` We need a president who will end the annual assault on Pell Grants and loans and programs for disadvantaged students,'' he said. In other developments: _ The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' wife, <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON>, will undergo tests at a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> hospital to determine the cause of pain and numbness she has been experiencing. A preliminary diagnosis indicated two herniated disks in the neck area. _ <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> said Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> has been named chairman of the party's platform-drafting committee <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>.

 Millions of dollars in bribes were paid to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s defense minister and other officials, and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> agents let loads of marijuana pass through a border station, according to an affidavit in a drug-smuggling case. The affidavit was filed by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in support of the government's seizure of more than $ 10 million in assets belonging to <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Figueroa-Soto </PERSON> and nine others. They were arrested last week during raids involving more than 100 officers in several cities. <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> displayed some of the assets Tuesday and said he expects more arrests and asset seizures in coming weeks. The affidavit contains a charge by a <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> informer that Gen. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Arevalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardoqui </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s defense minister, received a $ 10 million bribe in 1984 from an alleged partner of Figueroa-Soto's, <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON>, to assure protection of marijuana and poppy fields in the Mexican state of <LOCATION> Chihuahua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Arevalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardoqui </PERSON> has denied his family is involved in drug trafficking, and the Mexican federal attorney general's office also denied the allegations against <PERSON> Arevalo </PERSON> and other top law enforcement officials, The <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> reported Saturday. The affidavit also alleged that in 1983 Figueroa-Soto, as head of a marijuana growers' cooperative in <LOCATION> Sonora </LOCATION>, paid Dr. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ocana-Garcia </PERSON>, who was then <LOCATION> Sonora </LOCATION>'s governor, to ensure the safety of fields. <LOCATION> Sonora </LOCATION> is the Mexican state that borders <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ocana-Garcia </PERSON> also has denied any tie to narcotics trafficking. Officials have described Figueroa-Soto, who was arrested at his <LOCATION> Scottsdale </LOCATION> home last Thursday, as perhaps the largest Mexican marijuana dealer and worth an estimated $ 150 million. He was ordered held under $ 50 million bond last week. The affidavit, which was filed last week and first made public by The <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION>, also said <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agents were told that <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> inspector <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sainz </PERSON> allowed tons of marijuana to enter the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Nogales </LOCATION> in 1983. It also said Customs official <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Huerta </PERSON> allowed trailer loads of up to 15 tons of marijuana to pass his inspection station at <LOCATION> Nogales </LOCATION>. Acting port director in <LOCATION> Nogales </LOCATION> <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehbein </PERSON> would not say whether <PERSON> Sainz </PERSON> or <PERSON> Huerta </PERSON> were under investigation, The <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> reported Wednesday. He said <PERSON> Sainz </PERSON> resigned about four years ago without disciplinary action and that <PERSON> Huerta </PERSON> was still working at the port. The <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said Tuesday that officers seized $ 6.7 million in cash and bank accounts in last week's raids in cities in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, along with an estimated $ 500,000 in jewelry, seven homes valued at $ 1.7 million, 40 vehicles worth $ 1 million, two airplanes worth $ 115,000 and 90 pounds of marijuana. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> predicted more arrests and cash seizures in coming weeks.

<HEAD>Family Honor At Heart of Bedouin Murder Conspiracy Trial</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By MICHAEL WARREN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Bedouin couple demanded the death and mutilation of their unwanted son-in-law to avenge their honor, prosecutors said Wednesday, but the defense accused authorities of blowing up a tragic family problem into a murder conspiracy case. <PERSON> Suad </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ghada </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarawneh </PERSON>, now of <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, are accused of plotting to kill their daughter's husband and his family because in 1986 the 17-year-old girl spurned a marriage they arranged, and instead married her Syrian cousin. The Tarawnehs asked a private detective, <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrillo </PERSON>, to cut off the son-in-law's finger and genitals and return them to the couple, along with color photos of the bodies, Assistant State Attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dimitrouleas </PERSON> said in his opening arguments. The alleged plot was stopped before anyone was hurt, but the parents were accused of murder conspiracy and solicitation to commit murder. The Tarawnehs were arrested last February in <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Petrillo </PERSON> contacted authorities about the case. `` ` I'd like to keep the photos of the body as a souvenir,''' Dimitrouleas quoted <PERSON> Tarawneh </PERSON> as saying on secretly recorded tapes. `` ` You're Italian, <PERSON> Petrillo </PERSON>, you understand family. You understand honor. That's why we asked you to help us.''' Dimitrouleas quoted <PERSON> Tarawneh </PERSON> as telling the detective `` We are Moslem, and when you are in the desert, honor is very important to you.'' The prosecutor took aim at defense contentions that the threats against the son-in-law were only empty words. He noted that the cautious <PERSON> Tarawneh </PERSON> had even called <PERSON> Petrillo </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION> because he did not want to use the word `` kill'' over the telephone. In his opening arguments, defense attorney <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Spadaro </PERSON> disputed the prosecution version, saying the Tarawnehs were not killers, but tragic victims wrapped up in the emotions of their family crisis and the father's drinking. `` The first tragedy was the drinking problem, the second was the loss of their daughter in 1986 and the third was the hiring of this investigator,'' said <PERSON> Spadaro </PERSON>. <PERSON> Petrillo </PERSON>, he said, had been hired to find the daughter and located her in nearby <LOCATION> Tamarac </LOCATION>. But when she refused to see her parents, the detective turned their angry initial reaction into a murder plot, <PERSON> Spadaro </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Tarawneh </PERSON>, 46, a gynecologist, and his wife, 44, a nurse, left <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> 18 years ago. When their daughter <PERSON> Raniah </PERSON> married her Syrian cousin <PERSON> Mouataz </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdulsalam </PERSON> in 1986 over their objections, the angered parents said their honor had been blackened and had to be avenged. <PERSON> Abdulsalam </PERSON> is the son of Mrs. <PERSON> Tarawneh </PERSON>'s sister. The daughter testified Wednesday that her father once sent her uncle to kill her in <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, and had tried to cut off her hand when she first told him she wanted to marry her cousin. He also had her jailed briefly on what she said were trumped-up charges of stealing her mother's jewelry. `` He said I'd regret it, he'd kill me, he'd kill my husband, that I would regret it for the rest of my life,'' she testified. But, she said, he also wrote her a card apologizing, saying `` I never meant to hurt you _ you are my blood and flesh.'' She said her father abused both alcohol and prescription drugs, and had lost jobs at hospitals because of his habits. At first the Tarawnehs planned to kidnap their daughter and sell her into a prostitution ring in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, but that fell through and they switched to the murder plot, according to investigator <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Breece </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION>. The alleged plot was stopped before anyone was hurt, but the parents were accused of murder conspiracy and solicitation to commit murder against <PERSON> Abdulsalam </PERSON>, his mother and his younger sister. The Tarawnehs were arrested last February in <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Petrillo </PERSON> contacted authorities about the case.

<HEAD>Study: Lead Concentrations in School Water Violates EPA

 The city shipped bottled water to half of its elementary schools Wednesday after state health officials found lead concentrations in drinking water exceeded federal limits. Officials also plan to test schools outside the city following a report that drinking water in 40 <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> grade schools is unsafe and that water in another 19 schools contained lead levels just below <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> limits, said <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Prothrow-Stith </PERSON>, state public health commissioner. `` Obviously there is a problem and there's going to have to be more testing to insure that the public health and welfare is protected,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keough </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> deputy regional administrator. `` We are concerned because some of the levels were very high.'' Some parents gave their children bottles of water to take Wednesday, and school officials said they were concerned about the dangers of extended consumption of lead-tainted water for the city's 30,000 students in pre-kindergarten through fifth grade. `` This is another situation where urban schools are left behind,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Ubinas </PERSON>, principal of the <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blackstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in the city's <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> End </LOCATION>. `` Now we not only have to deal with the drug problem and the traffic outside but the lead. When will we be allowed to educate?'' The state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> sampled water at 79 public and two private elementary schools over the Memorial Day weekend after a television station reported high lead content at eight schools. Water at 40 schools exceeded the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> limit of 50 parts per million of lead in drinking water. The tests revealed a level of 2,300 parts per million at the water supply source in one school and 1,400 ppm at a water fountain in another. <PERSON> Keough </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> in July plans to recommend reducing the unsafe lead content level to 20 ppm. The tests showed an additional 19 schools had lead concentrations of between 20 and 50 ppm. Lead poisoning attacks the brain, kidneys, nervous system and red blood cells and can lead to brain damage and death, health officials said. Lead occurs in food, air, soil, dust, paint and water. Officials said poisoning is rarely caused by contaminated water alone, but overexposure to lead can stunt physical and mental development in children, causing nervous disorders, learning disabilities and mental problems. Children under 8 are especially vulnerable, they added. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Timperi </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, which analyzed the water samples, said three likely sources for the lead are lead pipes, lead solder used from 1980-86 and electric cooling systems in water fountains. Some lead pipes in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> schools are more than 50 years old, he said. Schools are more susceptible to high lead levels because water sits in pipes after school and on weekends, allowing greater lead absorption. In a 1976 study, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> found that 25 percent of Boston-area households exceeded federal lead safety limits. <PERSON> Keough </PERSON> said officials will attack the problem on a `` fountain by fountain'' basis by repairing or replacing pipes, solder and cooling systems. The <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spring </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> Wednesday delivered 680 five-gallon bottles of water, 136 coolers and 272,000 paper cups to city schools, Great Bear sales manager <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Pires-Donaghy </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Broadway Season Ends With Box Office and Attendance Increase</HEAD>

 Business boomed on Broadway during the 1987-88 season with a record $ 253 million worth of tickets sold to more than 8.1 million theatergoers, the League of American Theaters and Producers announced Wednesday. The figures solidified the upturn in ticket sales that began during the previous season when grosses totaled $ 209 million and some 7 million people saw a Broadway show, the league said. But while the grosses and attendance were up, production was down, with only 32 shows opening on Broadway between June 1, 1987 and May 29, 1988, compared to 40 the previous season. Still, the shows that managed to get to <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION> during the 1987-88 survived longer. `` There's a lot of choice on Broadway which is probably why there are so many people going,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON>, director of research for the league. `` We sold almost 200,000 tickets in each of the last three weeks. That's about as good as it ever gets.'' Musicals, particularly `` The Phantom of the Opera,'' again dominated the year, but several plays were also very strong at the box office. `` Phantom,'' which had a record $ 19 million advance sale, is expected to have as long a life in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> as such hardy holdovers from other seasons as `` Les Miserables,'' `` Cats,'' `` 42nd Street'' and `` A Chorus Line.'' There were 12 new musicals on Broadway during the 1987-88 season, compared to 11 the previous year. Although `` Phantom'' was the season's biggest musical hit, several other musicals were popular including `` Sarafina!,'' a South African musical; `` Chess,'' the <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice-ABBA-Trevor </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> extravaganza about international chess matches, and `` Into the <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>,'' a fairy tale musical written by <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sondheim </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lapine </PERSON>. Of the season's six revivals, the most successful was the Lincoln Center revival of <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>'s `` Anything Goes.'' There were eight new plays on Broadway, down from 13 the previous season, but of the eight, only one _ `` Serious Money'' _ was a quick flop. Five others are still running including the four <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> nominees for best play _ `` A Walk in the Woods'' by <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Blessing </PERSON>, `` <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'s Come and Gone'' by <PERSON> August </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, `` M. Butterfly'' by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hwang </PERSON> and `` Speed-the-Plow'' by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mamet </PERSON>. `` How many seasons have there been where a show like ` Burn This' would not be nominated for best play? <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON> said, referring to the season's fifth new play still running. `` In that sense, I think it was a rich season.'' If box office receipts were up, so were costs and ticket prices as well as risks to producers. The $ 50 ticket for a musical is now the norm rather than the exception. A $ 40 top ticket for a play on weekend nights is also not unusual. The average paid admission, according to the league, was $ 31.10, up from $ 29.86 for the previous season. The flops were more costly too. `` Carrie,'' a musical based on the <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> horror novel, lost a record $ 8 million and closed after five performances, the most expensive failure in Broadway history. <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON> looks for the increase in ticket sales to continue. `` In terms of attendance, I think we will do very well because the last three weeks have been extraordinary,'' he said. `` We have the momentum to keep going. A lot of that may be from tourism and the weakness of the dollar. The pick up we usually get from tourism during the summer is happening earlier.''

<HEAD>Judge Strikes Down Ban On Secrecy Pledges</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A judge has struck down a congressional provision that bars the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration from requiring government workers to sign secrecy pledges during the first 10 months of this year. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON> ruled that the provision contained in a spending resolution passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last December unconstitutionally intruded on the president's power to protect government secrets. `` With a tug of the purse strings section 630 -LRB- of the spending resolution -RRB- establishes a precedent unrestrained by discernible standards and intrudes dramatically upon presidential authority,'' <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON> said in a May 27 ruling made public this week. The judge made the decision in suits by seven members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and three federal employee organizations charging the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration flouted the continuing resolution by requiring employees with access to classified information to sign security forms. SF189, already signed by more than 1.7 million federal employees, is a pledge never to divulge classified or classifiable information without permission. The other form, SF4193, requires employees to seek `` prepublication review of contemplated disclosures.'' The forms are criticized by members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who contend that they stem the flow of information to <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON> found that `` the sensitive and complicated role cast for the president as this nation's emissary in foreign relations requires that congressional intrusion upon the president's oversight of national security information be more severely limited than might be required in matters of purely domestic concern. <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON> said he found `` particularly offensive'' provisions of the continuing resolution that barred the president from preventing federal employees from communicating with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> or interfering with the legislative branch's ability to get secret information from government employees. Another provision <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON> found objectionable bars any secrecy agreement that is at odds with existing law. `` Read together, these provisions of section 630 permit the president to ensure the secrecy of national security information only by those means authorized by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON> said. The suits were filed by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION>. They were joined by <PERSON> Sens </PERSON>. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>, D-Ark.; <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Grassley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>.; as well as Reps. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Boxer </PERSON>, D-Calif.; <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, D-Col.; and <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sikorski </PERSON>, D-Minn. <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON> dismissed all suits except several claims by <ORGANIZATION> AFGE </ORGANIZATION> that the secrecy agreements violated employees' First and <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, an attorney for <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Litigation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, which represented the foreign service officers, said the plaintiffs planned to appeal what she called an unprecedented limit on the power of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in this area. Usually courts defer to the president in the absence of any action by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, she said. `` I do n't know of any situation where <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> acts and the president says ` Nay, nay, I am not going to do it.' This is a new twist.''

 Strong thunderstorms that brought flooding to north central <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> redeveloped Wednesday, while other powerful storms rumbled from the Plains to the Northeast, and hot weather clung to the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> river valleys. North central <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' storms brought wind gusts to 54 mph near <PERSON> Haskill </PERSON>, but showers and thunderstorms also were scattered across south central and southeast <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Showers and a few thunderstorms were scattered from central and eastern parts of <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> into north central and northeast <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. Showers and thunderstorms were also devbeloping across parts of central Missouri. Showers and thunderstorms were also scattered across parts of the <LOCATION> northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, and from the eastern <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> region through <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state and north central <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> to the central New <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> coast.

 <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> capitalized on Soviet errors to post a 15-2 victory Wednesday in the first U.S.-Soviet baseball game ever played on Russian soil. <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> struck immediately in the first inning, when lead-off batter <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Finegan </PERSON> doubled, then scored on two successive wild wild pitches by the Soviets' <PERSON> Alexei </PERSON> <PERSON> Koshivoy </PERSON>. The Hopkins squad put the game out of reach in the third when first baseman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Durocher </PERSON> walked, advanced to second on a Koshivoy wild pitch and scored on a single by second baseman <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>. After two successive errors loaded the bases, third baseman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Horner </PERSON> hit a drive that eluded center fielder <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Krupenchenkov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Horner </PERSON> came all the way home to make the score 7-0. The Soviets scored their runs in the fifth and seventh innings on errant pickoff attempts. The Soviet team, from the D.I. <ORGANIZATION> Mendeleyev </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION>, was outmatched from the start by the Americans' pitching As a result, the Soviets had trouble hitting the ball out of the infield. But the matchup seemed to be less a sporting event and more an exercise in good will, since the <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> squad had offered instruction to the Soviets earlier in the week and given the Soviets souvenir T-shirts before the game. And the American team even provided excuses for their opposition, noting that the Soviets were hampered because they practice indoors and have to make do with old gloves made in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> or gloves sewn by hand and field hockey balls and baseballs used over and over again. Still, the crowd of about 300 people in the <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Komsomol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Factory </ORGANIZATION> stadium seemed to enjoy the game, cheering both sides but also whistling in displeasure at the many errors by the Soviets. <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> alumnus <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Flaxman </PERSON>, a dealer in skins and hides in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, is responsible for arranging the game. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, busy elsewhere, was unable to throw out the first pitch. The Soviets began their baseball program in 1987, with an eye on the Olympics of 1992, when the game will be part of the competition. A national Soviet squad played a team from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> last summer, with disastrous results. The Soviets lost by scores of 22-0 and 30-2. But <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> Coach <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Babb </PERSON> said the Soviets are `` making noticeable improvements each day ... each day they get a little better.'' <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Holland </PERSON>, who is acting as the <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>' trainer on the trip, said that during the joint practice session on Monday, `` even guys who do n't speak a word of Russian after a while were saying `` Molodetz! Molodetz!'' -LRB- `` Well done! Well done!'' -RRB- after the Russians made a good play.'' Still, other members of the Hopkins squad said they were surprised at the Russians' lack of basic baseball fundamentals, such as catching and fielding, although they competed with the intensity of a <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, now manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reds </ORGANIZATION>, or <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>, an outfielder with the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dodgers </ORGANIZATION>. `` They have a desire to play. They come out in the snow to practice. They're really nuts about baseball,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Timmerman </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> shortstop. <PERSON> Horner </PERSON> had said he was impressed by the toughness of the Soviet players, most of whom are good athletes who play basketball, volleyball, or compete in track. `` I saw one of their pitchers get hit in the back by a line drive _ one of the hardest I've ever seen hit _ and he did n't even flinch,'' he said before the game. `` They're not afraid of the ball.'' The Soviet media publicized the game and several newspapers ran stories that caught the spirit of good will. A front-page article in Tuesday's editions of the newspaper Sovietsky Sport carried the headline: `` When the score does n't count.

<HEAD>Residents Move Back After Rains, Broken Dam Force Evacuation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Heavy thunderstorms dumped more than 10 inches of rain on this north-central <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> town, overflowing a creek, obliterating an earthen dam and forcing the evacuation of about 60 people early Wednesday, authorities said. The storm waters also damaged homes, businesses and bridges and briefly shut down some highways elsewhere in the area late Tuesday and early Wednesday. `` A wall of water came through here and these people barely got out in time,'' said <PERSON> Gayle </PERSON> <PERSON> Godfrey </PERSON> as he stood amid torn furnishings and soggy carpet drying on the shore of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eans </LOCATION>. The flood's apex came between 3 a.m. and 6 a.m., and by 8:30 a.m., residents were allowed to return to their homes. All that remained of the former 100-acre private lake at daylight were acres of mud, tons of debris and fallen trees. <PERSON> Maida </PERSON> <PERSON> Godfrey </PERSON> pointed to grass and mud stains 4 -LCB- feet high on the white walls of her home, which she estimated sustained about $ 30,000 in damage. `` We had to leave out the back door when the water came pouring in,'' she said. `` We've lived here 22 years, and it's never gotten this high before.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Godfrey </PERSON>, 40, and her 18-year-old son, <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON>, ran up a hill to the home of a neighbor. From the top of the hill, she said she heard a loud roar about 5 a.m. as water broke through the dam that was built in the 1930s in a water reclamation project. Floodwaters also overflowed the banks of <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, tearing through homes and businesses in Comanche and knocking chunks of pavement from bridgets. `` I looked outside my trailer house to see how the rain was and saw water flowing over my tires,'' said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Donald </PERSON>, who evacuated his home about 4 a.m. `` My parents came over in a four-wheel drive and got me. A fire truck came into the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> area later and evacuated everybody else. `` At the trailer house across the street, they had to get a boat to find that man. Water was chest-high in his house,'' <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> said. At <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Comanche </LOCATION>, about four miles southeast of this town of 12,600, a dam held but water spilled over its lip, said <PERSON> Duane </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogle </PERSON>, a teacher at <ORGANIZATION> Comanche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, where the evacuated residents stayed until the floodwaters subsided. North along <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 377, the floodwaters blocked several underpasses and bridges with logs and debris. The driver of an 18-wheeler reportedly swam to safety as floodwaters washed his truck off the road. Streets in several other counties in the area also were flooded by the storms, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported. Comanche and 42 other <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> counties, most of them in the north-central part of the state, remained under a severe thunderstorm watch until late Wednesday night.

<HEAD>US Will Support Help with Debts of `Poorest' Nations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> said Wednesday it supports granting concessions to some of the world's poorest nations to make it easier for them repay billions of dollars in loans. Treasury Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told a news conference at the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> that lower interest rates or more liberal terms of repayment could help ease the pressure on those countries. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said members of the <ORGANIZATION> Paris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> _ a group of lenders including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> _ should be able to negotiate their own terms of financing. `` It is important to realize that what we are talking about here is a change in the policy of the <ORGANIZATION> Paris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, which would permit creditor governments to differentiate in the approach to rescheduling,'' he said. Concessions would involve only `` official debt owed by the poorest of the poor,'' he said. Most of the money owed by the poorest countries is `` official debt'' _ funds lent by developed countries. Many African nations can not repay foreign debts that now exceed $ 200 billion for the continent and have urged Western nations to write off part or all the obligation. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> made clear he does not propose that kind of relief. He said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal `` will continue to require that each country be looked at on a case-by-case basis. It is therefore not a call for a generalized debt relief proposal or a global approach, if you will. But it does represent a change, it certainly does, as far as official debt owed by the poorest of the poor.'' In effect, this means the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will not block efforts by the other <ORGANIZATION> Paris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> member countries to draw up debt concession agreements with certain countries. Asked if other members of the Club of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> are likely to favor his proposal, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said: `` I think it is a major step in the direction of some suggestions that have been heretofore made by some of our <ORGANIZATION> Paris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> partners. So I believe they will welcome this.'' `` Those governments that felt free, legally or from a policy basis, to grant concessional or perhaps more concessional interest rates would be free to do so, whereas other governments could perhaps look at a broader range of maturities as a means of contributing,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration does not have the authority to write off debt. `` One of the difficulties ... the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has with a proposal to move to concessional interest rates on official debt is that that constitutes to a degree debt forgiveness, which the executive branch is not empowered, alone, to grant,'' he said. `` We are permitted to negotiate more liberal terms of repayment. We have been doing that, and my remarks indicate a willingness on our part to consider moving along that same path in the future,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Causes Given of Legionnaires' Disease Outbreak</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Poor maintenance of the air conditioning system and extensive construction in the vicinity were responsible for a fatal outbreak of Legionnaires' disease at <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> headquarters, investigators said Wednesday. Thirty-nine people contracted the disease in and around the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> offices from mid-April to early May and two died, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Westminster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> executives and engineers who made up the investigating team recommended improved maintenance procedures relating to its water-cooled air conditioning system and examining links between the disease and local construction and demolition projects. `` The outbreak appears to have been due to a combination of internal and external factors,'' said chairman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandbank </PERSON>, deputy director of engineering. `` The external factors included the extensive demolition and building activity in the vicinity of <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` Shortcomings were revealed in the ... procedures associated with the applications of water treatment chemicals and biocides to the cooling tower,'' he said. Legionnaires' disease was first diagnosed in 1976 when 221 people contracted it at an American Legion convention in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. It produces symptoms similar to pneumonia and often caused by bacteria from water-cooled air conditioning units. The <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> has said air systems in its buildings have been disinfected.

 A major investor in the <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> nuclear power plant said it would pull out of the troubled project Wednesday, a setback that one opponent claimed could kill the controversial plant. `` Our many successes have been hidden by the shadow of <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, general manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wholesale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, after its eight-member board of directors voted to withdraw. <ORGANIZATION> MMWEC </ORGANIZATION>, with its 11.6 percent stake in the plant, is <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON>'s fourth-largest investor Its action `` will enable <ORGANIZATION> MMWEC </ORGANIZATION> to get on with its business,'' <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> added. The $ 5.4 billion Seabrook reactor is completed but lacks approved evacuation plans required for commercial operation. In addition, its largest investor, <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION>, filed for <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> protection from creditors on Jan. 28. <ORGANIZATION> PSNH </ORGANIZATION> owns 36 percent of the project. <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said the action would have no immediate effect, but he said the project's joint owners would meet soon to discuss it. `` The rest of the owners remain committed, and the bottom line remains the plant is very much needed for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` We will overcome this and the plant will be brought on line.'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Backus </PERSON>, a lawyer for the <ORGANIZATION> Seacoast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Pollution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, which has fought the project since its inception, said <ORGANIZATION> MMWEC </ORGANIZATION>'s action could doom the project `` I believe there's a major funding problem for the project and it is so grossly uneconomic right now that this may be the end of it,'' <PERSON> Backus </PERSON> said. The top three owners of the Seabrook project _ <ORGANIZATION> PSNH </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illuminating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utilities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> _ said Wednesday that they would n't pick up <ORGANIZATION> MMWEC </ORGANIZATION>'s 11.6 percent stake in the plant. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> plant has been dogged by troubles since <ORGANIZATION> PSNH </ORGANIZATION> announced its intention to build it 20 years ago. The company shelved its original plans, and environmental impact hearings delayed the project in the 1970s. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has opposed evacuation planning for communities in his state near the plant in an effort to prevent it from going into service. <ORGANIZATION> MMWEC </ORGANIZATION>'s action comes less than one week after <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> reached an agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to abandon the $ 5.3 billion <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> nuclear plant, which also has never generated a watt of electricity. <ORGANIZATION> MMWEC </ORGANIZATION>, which supplies power to 34 municipalities across the state, bought its shares in <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> on behalf of 28 utilities in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and eight in other Northeastern states. The company has sunk $ 875 million into the stalled plant so far. <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> said several utilities have asked <ORGANIZATION> MMWEC </ORGANIZATION> to withdraw because of the steady rise in electric rates required to meet <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON>'s costs The company pays about $ 90 million a year for its long-term <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> debt and payments of about $ 15 million to $ 20 million annually to support the idle plant. <ORGANIZATION> MMWEC </ORGANIZATION>'s board voted to stop further payments for <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> but to continue to service the debt. By pulling out of the project, <ORGANIZATION> MMWEC </ORGANIZATION> hopes the state will allow it to issue tax-exempt bonds to refinance its Seabrook borrowings, officials said. Previously, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has refused tax-exempt financing for the project. <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> declined to speculate on the effect the withdrawal would have on the project, saying it was `` of secondary consideration.'' Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., another <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> opponent, said the decision `` reflects the bottom-line reality that <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> is a teetering financial dinosaur about to become extinct. <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>'s plan calls for <ORGANIZATION> MMWEC </ORGANIZATION> to ask other <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> owners to assume its share of construction and maintenance costs or buy its shares outright. He declined to say what might happen if they refuse. Hunt estimated that <ORGANIZATION> MMWEC </ORGANIZATION> had three months' worth of payments in an escrow account that the other investors would exhaust before taking any action. The joint owners also usually grant a five-month grace period before declaring another owner in default, he said.

 Criticism of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's national parks policy over alleged budget cuts is based on a `` pernicious mythology,'' a top <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said Wednesday. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON>, assistant secretary for Fish, Wildlife and <PERSON> Parks </PERSON>, told a conference of more than 300 park superintendents he was tired of `` a continuing drumbeat of critics claiming the administration is anti-park and committers of sins.'' <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s 1980 operating budget was $ 391 million compared with $ 734 million that the administration has proposed for the next fiscal year begining July 1. `` That constitutes the largest operating budget in the history of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and represents 29 percent post-inflation, real growth over the past seven years,'' <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> said. During the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration, he said, the park service got 9 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s aggregate budget, compared with the current 14 percent. Further, <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> said, the park service employees 16,414 people, the highest level in its 72-year history. `` These numbers,'' he said, `` bespeak a commitment to a first class national park system and they are at odds with the current pernicious mythology.'' Earlier, <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> challenged Rep. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vento </PERSON>'s introduction of a bill to reorganize the park service's hierarchy to make it independent, saying it was n't necessary because `` if it ai n't broke, do n't fix it. <PERSON> Vento </PERSON>, D-Minn., opened the four-day conference by telling the park superintendents that they `` do the nearly impossible job day after day -LRB- of -RRB- protecting the greatest treasures in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ the national park system <PERSON> Vento </PERSON>, chairman of the national parks and public lands subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Insular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, has introduced a bill in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to take away the <ORGANIZATION> interior </ORGANIZATION> secretary's power over the national park system. The bill would give that power directly to the park service director and a three-member oversight board that would report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the president. Currently, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> <PERSON> Mott </PERSON> reports to <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> through <PERSON> Horn </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mott </PERSON> addressed the parks superintendents earlier in the day, saying the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> must become more effective in dealing with outside threats to park resources because `` we can not achieve our goals if we continue to try and solve problems in a crisis atmosphere.'' `` If the last decade has taught us anything, it is that parks are no longer islands,'' <PERSON> Mott </PERSON> said. `` I have often told you -LRB- park superintendents -RRB- that I want you to be risk-takers. Then, even if the risks are high, select the one that most benefits the resources of the park.'' <PERSON> Vento </PERSON> spoke in the same vein during his address. He said increasing pressures on the park system due to diminishing natural resources and a burgeoning population have led to `` pressures of certain segments of society to take actions detrimental to -LRB- basic laws -RRB- which protect the national park system.'' Environmental and citizens' groups cite logging, oil drilling and commercial and residential development near parks, as well as man-made pollution, as just some of the threats to the 341 sites in the national park system. `` The result of these conflicts has been a rapidly escalating process whereby professional resource managers' decision-making has been overshadowed by political decision-making,'' said <PERSON> Vento </PERSON>. He said such interference tempts park managers to make choices based on short-term needs rather than long-term protection goals. At an informal news conference Wednesday prior to his speech to the superintendents, <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> said <PERSON> Vento </PERSON>'s bill to reorganize the park service hierarchy is unnecessary. `` If it ai n't broke, do n't fix it,'' said <PERSON> Horn </PERSON>. `` When you marry up senior political management with senior career management, that's the healthiest combination. To separate that good ... marriage, I think, would be a mistake.'' <PERSON> Vento </PERSON> said his proposal would protect park managers with `` some degree of independence ... so -LRB- they -RRB- can freely and publicly voice opposition to an action that might degrade park resources without fear of being fired, demoted, or punished.'' `` This would provide for a management framework that permits a witness to testify before a congressional subcommittee and present a professional viewpoint rather than a political one imposed by others with little professional knowledge or interest,'' said <PERSON> Vento </PERSON>. Asked about <PERSON> Vento </PERSON>'s statement that implied park service personnel appearing before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are constrained from disagreeing with park service management policies if they feel they are detrimental to their park, <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> said, `` I reject that categorically.'' During the three years he and <PERSON> Mott </PERSON> have been in their respective jobs, said <PERSON> Horn </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> interior </ORGANIZATION> secretary has had `` a standing order that if you are asked, you can relate'' personal views about park policy, whether it agrees with the administration agenda or not. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Pritchard </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit citizens' group that focuses on the national parks system, said: `` We are 100 percent behind Congressman <PERSON> Vento </PERSON>'s bill. We are completely committed to it.'' <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Destry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON>, the association's vice president, described the last seven years of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's management of the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> as `` a constant tug of war between a citizenry that is committed to the parks system, a <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> which is quite protective of the parks system, and an administration which is not.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Eli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lilly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has dealt a serious setback to the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's anti-cocaine program by refusing to allow use of a `` safe and effective herbicide'' against coca-producing areas in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. `` We think the short-term impact is serious,'' said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON>, alluding to <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON>'s decision last week not to sell to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government the herbicide tebuthiuron in a coca eradication campaign focused mainly in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Huallaga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> She said the firm, which is the sole manufacturer of the chemical, should reconsider its decision in light of the serious cocaine problem in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. On <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, Rep. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> English </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., expressed outrage over <ORGANIZATION> Lilly </ORGANIZATION>'s decision The Indianapolis-based company gave no reason for its decision in making the announcement last week, citing only `` a number of practical and policy considerations.'' <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON>, manager of corporate communcations at <ORGANIZATION> Lilly </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday the company had no further comment. But Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> told reporters <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON> apparently was worried about possible retaliatory measures by `` traffickers or terrorists.'' The company also had come under pressure from environmentalists who were concerned about the ecological impact of the herbicide. Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> would have preferred to have worked with the company on resolving its security concerns. She said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> governments have been conducting field tests to identify a safe, effective herbicide for use against coca for several years. Tebuthiuron, known informally as `` <PERSON> Spike </PERSON>,'' was considered to be among the safest and most effective, but no final decision had been made about which herbicide should be used, Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said. `` According to our information the safety and effectiveness of spike has been clearly demonstrated and defended by the company. Numerous environmental tests have been carried out in compliance with federal regulations,'' she said. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wrobleski </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for international narcotics matters, said <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON> made the decision even though the herbicide has been manufactured for more than 15 years, has been proven safe by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> standards and is widely available in this country for projects such as clearing brush for rights of way. The chemical is sold to other government agencies including the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, she said. Testifying before a House Government Operations subcommittee assessing the war on drugs, Ms. <PERSON> Wrobleski </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers are researching whether to propose legislation that would compel <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON> to sell the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> the chemical `` in the vital national interests of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government.'' The safety of <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON>'s employees must be weighed against public concerns about `` the 5 million regular users of cocaine and our desperate need for a chemical solution to widespread coca cultivation in the Andes,'' she said. English, chairman of the subcommittee, said he was `` stunned and outraged'' at <ORGANIZATION> Lilly </ORGANIZATION> and called the company a `` deserter'' in the war on drugs. He insisted that company representatives appear before his panel to explain their decision. `` We're going to go to any length possible to get our hands on'' the herbicide for use in spraying programs in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Wrobleski </PERSON> said. She said coca crops currently are destroyed by chopping them down, a slow process that eradicates less than 1 percent of the total. `` Unless we push the chemical button, we can not dent that problem appreciably,'' Ms. <PERSON> Wrobleski </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 A British nobleman who managed a billionaire's private game preserve testified Wednesday that he knew hawks and other protected birds were being killed on the estate but denied killing any himself. Sir <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Musgrave </PERSON>, 66, the huntsman of the preserve, said he never saw any hawks killed, but he knew his gamekeepers were doing their jobs if they were killing the birds, which preyed on pheasants raised for hunters. `` I've not killed a thing, sir,'' he said in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court here. <PERSON> Musgrave </PERSON> also testified that he never told the owners of the 850-acre <LOCATION> Albemarle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> property, businessman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kluge </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON>, about the killings. <PERSON> Kluge </PERSON>, 73, is chief owner of <ORGANIZATION> Metromedia </ORGANIZATION>, a telecommunications and technology holding company. Last fall, <ORGANIZATION> Forbes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> listed him as the second-richest man in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, putting his worth at $ 3 billion. He and his wife were not charged. Earlier Wednesday, gamekeeper <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Amos </PERSON>, 20, admitted killing as many as 25 hawks and owls on the preserve over the past two years, saying he knew killing hawks was illegal but did not realize the seriousness of the offense. <PERSON> Musgrave </PERSON>, <PERSON> Amos </PERSON> and fellow gamekeeper <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Shardlow </PERSON>, 25, face misdemeanor charges of conspiring to violate federal game laws. All three defendants are British citizens. <PERSON> Musgrave </PERSON> owned a sporting consultant business and was hired to manage the <LOCATION> Albemarle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> preserve. He carries the title `` Sir'' because he is a baronet, a holder of a hereditary title in British nobility. <PERSON> Amos </PERSON>' testimony on the trial's fifth day paralleled that of <PERSON> Shardlow </PERSON>, who told the court Tuesday that he killed about 25 hawks and owls during his two years as gamekeeper. Under cross-examination by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shardlow </PERSON> denied being ordered to kill the birds. He also said the Kluges knew nothing about the killings. Like <PERSON> Amos </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shardlow </PERSON> said he knew killing the birds was illegal but thought it was `` equivalent to a speeding ticket.'' Asked why he killed the birds, <PERSON> Shardlow </PERSON> replied, `` To keep my job, sir.'' If the predator birds had not been destroyed, pheasants and ducks stocked at the preserve to be hunted by guests would not have survived and and the preserve would have been closed, <PERSON> Shardlow </PERSON> said. The chief prosecution witness, former gamekeeper <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Heath </PERSON>, has said as many as 400 hawks were killed on the preserve during the past two years. <PERSON> Amos </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shardlow </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> Heath </PERSON>'s estimate was much too high. If convicted, <PERSON> Musgrave </PERSON> faces a maximum sentence of 3 -LCB- years in prison and a $ 35,000 fine. <PERSON> Shardlow </PERSON> could get 2 -LCB- years in prison at a $ 25,000 fine. <PERSON> Amos </PERSON> could be sentenced to a year and fined $ 10,000.

<HEAD>Britain Loses ``Spycatcher'' Appeal in Australian High Court</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The High Court of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> on Thursday rejected the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> government's final appeal to stop publication of the book `` Spycatcher'' in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. In a unanimous decision, the judges dismissed <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s appeal from a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> court of appeal ruling, paving the way for publication of the book in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. The British government was ordered to pay costs. Although 240,000 copies of the book by <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> have been sold in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> wanted further copies of it banned and to be awarded all profits from past sales here. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> contended that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was obligated not to write about his experiences as a former British intelligence official. The High Court decision cleared the way for Thursday's scheduled paperback launch of the book in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. In `` Spycatcher,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> details his 20 years in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s MI-5 secret service tracking down traitors and accuses his former boss, the late Sir <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollis </PERSON>, of being a Soviet mole _ or deeply concealed double agent. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, 73, lives in retirement in <LOCATION> Tasmania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s southernmost state, where he breeds thoroughbred horses with his wife <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> Despite a ban on sales of the book in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, the work has sold an estimated 1.4 million copies worldwide, according to publishers <ORGANIZATION> Heinemann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Australia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd </ORGANIZATION>.

 The acting chief executive on Wednesday said that President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> has cancer and called him `` a man on the verge of death.'' Vice President <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> <PERSON> Claramount </PERSON>, who became acting president Tuesday when <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> was flown to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for treatment, made the comment to journalists at the presidential residence after he met with <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Corr </PERSON>. `` It has been confirmed that President <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> has a cancerous bleeding ulcer in the stomach. Today's -LRB- Wednesday's -RRB- examination of his whole body _ the abdomen and thorax _ showed that the liver is also affected by cancer.'' He said an official prognosis would be issued Thursday by doctors at <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, where <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> was admitted to treatment. In what was interpreted as a call for compassionate treatment of the subject in local news media, <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> <PERSON> Claramount </PERSON> said: `` I ask for a minimal expression of humanity, of charity. A fellow man's pain can not be toyed with No one can doubt the word of a man on the verge of death, who has had the courage to say it.'' Just before that he read part of the 41st Psalm. He quoted the psalm as saying `` My enemies speak badly of me, saying ` When will he die?' Those who hate me murmur against me.'' <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> <PERSON> Claramount </PERSON> added: `` Unfortunately in the past days, this kind of situation has come up in the country.'' He said <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> would decide what treatment to follow after being informed by doctors. The acting president said that when it was believed the cancer was limited to the stomach `` there was a tendency to operate. But that may have changed with the results of the subsequent examinations.''

 Three more people were arrested Wednesday on charges that they were part of a scheme to mail cocaine to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military post office in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, and officials said more arrests were expected. The three Georgian women arrested Wednesday and two <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> women arrested last week appeared before a federal magistrate. A sixth suspect, the husband of one of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> women, was in custody in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Authorities said the scheme came to light last week when a former soldier, stopped for a traffic violation, admitted that he was carrying cocaine and agreed to cooperate with police. His information led to the arrests of the six. <ORGANIZATION> Colquitt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gene </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beard </ORGANIZATION> said investigators seized two packages of cocaine that were mailed to <LOCATION> Moultrie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, from the military post office in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The drugs were to be taken from <LOCATION> Moultrie </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, he said. It was the fifth case in recent months in which drug smuggling from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> has been linked in some way with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military presence there. There are about 10,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen deployed in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. In December, two civilian security guards who worked for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> were arrested at <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> after Customs agents allegedly found cocaine in their suitcases. The other three cases, all in late January or early February, involved cocaine found on military airplanes flying out of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> or someone with drugs attempting to board such a plane. In the most recent case, <PERSON> Beard </PERSON> said two packages of cocaine _ an 18-pound package seized from <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Bigelow </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colquitt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> on May 24 and a 29-pound package seized Friday at the <LOCATION> Moultrie </LOCATION> post office _ had been mailed to <LOCATION> Moultrie </LOCATION> from a military post office in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Paige </PERSON> <PERSON> Eversole </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said investigators were in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> on Tuesday and planned to go from there to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to investigate any military involvement in the cocaine shipments. `` The Army has investigations going on, and has had for some time, into drug trafficking by service members and by people posing as service members in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' she said. There was no evidence so far that anyone on active duty was involved in the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> scheme, she said. An <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> affidavit released Wednesday said <PERSON> Bigelow </PERSON>, an informant, told investigators he had traveled to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> twice this year to meet with two members of the drug operation. He said he arranged for cocaine packages to be mailed to the three <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> women. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Agent <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Macon </LOCATION> said the drug operation appears to have been going on for `` some time,'' and more arrests are expected. `` We consider it a very significant investigation,'' he said. `` We're investigating importation into this country by two methods _ hand-carrying and mailing it.'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bigelow </PERSON>, who was stationed in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> while serving in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, likely will face federal charges stemming from his alleged involvement in the operation. The sheriff said he could also face state drug charges. Taken before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> on Wednesday were <PERSON> Maxine </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 24, <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> McGee </PERSON>, 25, and <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, 31, all residents of <LOCATION> Colquitt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Regina </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmela </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> Thom </PERSON>, both of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. They were charged with conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute, said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> scheduled a bond hearing for the defendants Thursday afternoon. Ms. <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> said the government plans to argue that they should not be released. Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s husband, <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, was arrested in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on the same charge and is being held there, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who added that other warrants have been issued. After he was arrested in the traffic case and agreed to cooperate with police, <PERSON> Bigelow </PERSON> called <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> to arrange for couriers to pick up the cocaine in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, the affidavit said. Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Thom </PERSON> were arrested Friday after they arrived in <LOCATION> Moultrie </LOCATION> and met <PERSON> Bigelow </PERSON> at a motel. <PERSON> Beard </PERSON> said it appeared that <LOCATION> Moultrie </LOCATION> was one of several <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> towns where cocaine was mailed from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. He said he did n't know what measures would have been in effect at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military post offices in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to prevent unauthorized people from mailing packages. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> declined to say whether the two men named by <PERSON> Bigelow </PERSON> in the affidavit, <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ferdson </PERSON> <PERSON> Allister </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, were in the military. <PERSON> Ferdson </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s brother, has been arrested in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> on unrelated drug charges. `` It's bound to be a larger operation, but our man says he does n't know any of the other players,'' <PERSON> Beard </PERSON> said.

 When he departed for medical treatment in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> this week, President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> left behind a country ravaged by war and a <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> party torn by infighting. On Wednesday night, <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> <PERSON> Claramount </PERSON>, the acting chief executive, told journalists <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> has cancer and was `` a man on the verge of death.'' But in his final year in office, <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> already had become a man devoid of much power and one whose absence was not expected to have a profound effect on <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s problems. The 62-year-old president, arguably <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s staunchest ally in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>, is in <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> for diagnosis and treatment. He told reporters before departing Tuesday that he was suffering from `` a bleeding ulcer of a malignant nature.'' Vice President <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> <PERSON> Claramount </PERSON>, who became acting president Tuesday when <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> was flown to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, told reporters at the presidential residence in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> late Wednesday, after meeting with <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Corr </PERSON>: `` It has been confirmed that President <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> has a cancerous bleeding ulcer in the stomach. Today's -LRB- Wednesday's -RRB- examination of his whole body _ the abdomen and thorax _ showed that the liver is also affected by cancer.'' He said to the correspondents, `` I ask for a minimal expression of humanity, of charity. A fellow man's pain can not be toyed with. No one can doubt the word of a man on the verge of death, who has had the courage to say it.'' The farewell ceremony Tuesday had the air of a funeral at which the deceased was on hand to say goodbye. Many of <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s family members were openly crying, and the president gave long embraces to friends and associates. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> appeared lean and haggard and at times on the verge of tears. Leftist guerrillas said in a broadcast by their clantestine radio station: `` <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> leaves the country with an incurable political disease because of the failure of the counterinsurgency plan. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> leaves, and the people remain to carry out the revolution.'' The rebels are waging an 8-year-old war against U.S.-backed government forces. Whether the government's campaign against the revolutionaries has failed remains to be determined. But almost all of the vows <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> made upon assuming the presidency in June 1984 remain unfulfilled. The guerrillas still carry out attacks and sabotage throughout the country and exercise a significant degree of political control and open activity in two northern provinces. The economy is in a shambles. The average Salvadoran's real income is almost 40 percent below what it was at the start of the war. About 500,000 people _ 10 percent of the population _ has been displaced to squalid shantytowns and refugee camps. Because of the lack of security, investment is virtually nil. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> suffered a scathing defeat in municipal and legislative elections in March. The electorate, in what was seen as a massive popular rejection of the incumbents' performance, gave control of the legislature to the rightist <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, or Arena. A surging <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> appears in good shape to win the presidential election next March. The Constitution prohibits <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> from running again in any event. The Christian Democrats are trying to keep their party from splitting. Two former <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> ministers and party founders, <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rey </PERSON> <PERSON> Prendes </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON>, claim the party's presidential candidacy <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> tried last month to avoid a split by calling on both to back a unity candidate. They ignored his appeal. He left <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> <PERSON> Claramount </PERSON> in charge of the executive branch. <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> <PERSON> Claramount </PERSON> delivered <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s state-of-the-republic address Wednesday to the new legislature. He promised to pursue <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s project to meet with leaders of other parties, unionists, businessmen and peasants to draft a united proposal to the guerrillas for ending the war. But the proposal, if and when it is worked out, is expected to be a new version of old calls to lay down arms and participate in elections. The guerrillas have rejected such a call, claiming the conditions for democracy do not exist. They demand a share of power, which the government refuses to consider. The conservative daily <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grafica </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday of <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s illness: `` The absence of the chief executive, for very worrisome motives, makes for even more uncertainty as to what will happen during the next year.

<HEAD>Police Seize About 100 Students In Anti-Olympic Protest</HEAD>

 Riot police broke up an anti-Olympic protest and arrested about 100 radical students Thursday outside a hotel where <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Samaranch </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Olympic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> president, was staying. <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> news agency, said police had information some of the protesters had plans to kidnap <PERSON> Samaranch </PERSON>. The report gave no details. Hundreds of police quickly dispersed the peaceful demonstration and dragged away shouting students who tried to block a road outside the Shilla Hotel. Protesters denounced <PERSON> Samaranch </PERSON> for saying that communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> can not act as co-host for the 1988 Olympics, set to begin Sept. 17 in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. `` Stage united Olympics!,'' students yelled before police overpowered them. Hundreds of police remained on guard around the hotel after the incident. Radical students have demanded that <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> be allowed to act as Olympics co-host to help promote reunification of the divided <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula. The two Koreas, divided since 1945, are bitter enemies who have clashed repeatedly over the years. In the 1950-53 Korean War, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other nations fought under the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> flag on the side of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> intervened on the northern side. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has said it will boycott the Games if it is not co-host. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Olympic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> have said this is impossible because the Games are awarded to a single city. <PERSON> Samaranch </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> to inspect facilities for the Games, said this week <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> could not be co-host. He repeated his committee's offer to let the north stage up to five events if it drops its demand and takes part in the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Games. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> accused <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> of blowing up a South Korean airliner Nov. 29 with the loss of all 115 people aboard as part of efforts to disrupt the Olympics. The north says it had nothing to do with the incident.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, to the surprise of some refuseniks, said Wednesday that emigration barriers preventing people from leaving the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> may be the result of bureacratic snags rather than deliberate Kremlin policy. In a summit-finale news conference, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also said that it was General Secretary <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> who changed his view of the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> as an `` evil empire.'' He said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, his partner at four summit meetings, was `` different than previous Soviet leaders have been.'' The president said he hoped to conclude a U.S.-Soviet treaty to cut strategic nuclear arsenals by half before leaving office, but said it was more important to get a good agreement than to meet a January deadline.

 The AIDS virus probably did not jump from monkeys to humans but could have infected the common ancestors of humans and monkeys millions of years ago, researchers say. That conclusion comes from Japanese biologists who have determined the entire genetic code of the AIDS virus that infects African green monkeys. Some researchers have suggested that these monkeys may have been the source of the human AIDS virus. The Japanese team found that the African green monkey AIDS virus differed from the two known human AIDS viruses in several important respects. If the virus had jumped from monkeys to humans in recent times, the viruses would be identical or nearly so.

<HEAD>`Televangelism' Author Says Minister-Politician Prospects Unproved</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Writing a book about television evangelists is as risky as writing about politics. Yesterday's conclusions have a way of becoming quickly outdated. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Hadden </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> sociologist who has established himself as one of the country's leading students of electronic religions, took both risks in `` Televangelism: Power and Politics in God's Country,'' written with <PERSON> Anson </PERSON> <PERSON> Shupe </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. In their book, <PERSON> Hadden </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shupe </PERSON> make the case that <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> could win the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> nomination for president. By the time <PERSON> Hadden </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to promote the book, he was trying to explain how <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> lost. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s candidacy was dead after he finished third in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, a state he had once boasted of winning, and buried after he came up empty in the Super Tuesday primaries in the South. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> failed to mount a serious challenge to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, even though he beat the vice president in the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses, and <PERSON> Hadden </PERSON> believes it is an open question whether the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> right is capable of electing a candidate. <PERSON> Hadden </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shupe </PERSON> argue that a candidate from the Christian right stands to benefit from these factors: _ President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has legitimized religious conservatism _ The religious right overhwelmingly dominates religious broadcasting _ Ministries such as <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s `` 700 Club'' have developed impressive fund-raising skills _ There is evidence of a conservative shift in the electorate The reality, though, was that <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> could n't win this year. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s failure, <PERSON> Hadden </PERSON> said in a recent interview, was a combination of mistakes and a miscalculation of his base of support. `` He got so tangled up in his own words, and his own gaffes, that once he had attention there was never a moment to say, ` This is why I have a better vision for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.' `` He also erred very badly,'' <PERSON> Hadden </PERSON> said, `` in not addressing the religion issue head-on very early ... -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was able to wait until he had the nomination before he felt he had to do that; <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> should have done it very early.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> also overestimated the size of his base, <PERSON> Hadden </PERSON> said. `` He had measured the size of the evangelical <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> vote, and mistook it for his core constituency, which is charismatic,'' he said. `` Even the charismatics, upon seeing the way he was performing _ in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> basically, but between <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> _ began to shake their heads and say, ` This does not look like a man who is presidential.' So he did n't get the turnouts.'' That suggests, <PERSON> Hadden </PERSON> said, that there is no monolithic `` Christian right'' bloc. `` There is a huge conservative-evangelical-Christian sentiment out there, there is no doubt in my mind about that, but it is itself divided,'' he said. `` They are not warring in quite the way they warred in earlier times, they are loyal around particular clusters and leaders. `` It is not a matter of <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> vying for the leadership of the Christian right. They are, respectively, leaders of the charismatic and fundamentalist contingents, neither of which has a whole lot of influence over the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptists </ORGANIZATION>, who in turn are split into at least two very significant camps, nor the people who are roughly aligned with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evangelicals </ORGANIZATION>, which is yet another sector. `` Politically, if you can do what <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was successful in doing, getting significant figures lined up to support you, then you help keep them polarized.'' It may be, he said, that someone like President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who is not identified with any particular denomination, will have more success in courting that vote. `` I think there is a very important lesson there,'' <PERSON> Hadden </PERSON> said. `` He speaks their language without being one of them.''

 Mormon elder <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> today guides his white brethren through sacred temple rituals that just a decade ago were denied him because of his black skin. `` I think I have been greatly blessed. I feel my life has been very much fulfilled,'' said <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, who twice monthly performs rites in the church's <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Temple </LOCATION>. `` I may never be a rich man, but I do n't care to be. The riches I have are to have a good family, to teach my children the gospel.'' The ban ended June 9, 1978, when the late church President <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimball </PERSON> announced he'd received a revelation from God opening the priesthood, held by all worthy Mormon males older than 11, to black members of The Church of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> of Latter-day <ORGANIZATION> Saints </ORGANIZATION>. But despite the church's startling success among blacks since then, particularly in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, it still labors at home to overcome the ban's legacy: a lingering perception that Mormonism is a faith for whites. The church numbers 8,500 members in <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> and 5,000 in <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION> and is growing by about 2,000 converts a year in each country. New missions have opened recently in <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Leone </LOCATION>. In predominantly black <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, the church reaps more than 70 converts monthly. Blacks in the American South hold leadership positions once open only to whites. `` I started out being exotic and ended up being generic,'' said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cherry </PERSON>, one of the few American blacks baptized before 1978. Nor does the legacy of the ban appear to have slowed the church's overall growth. Since 1978, the church says its membership has nearly doubled from 3.8 million to 6.5 million worldwide. Black members say deliberate racism is extremely rare among white Mormons. Rather, they say, blacks and whites struggle with cultural and economic barriers that can undermine the most sincere fellowships. `` The first question I get is, ` Where did you play ball?''' said <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a black employed in the church's public communications department. `` When I say I did n't, then in their minds I'm either a pimp or a drug dealer. I'm still struggling with people who wo n't accept me for who I am, but I wo n't let that affect my beliefs.'' Like many black Mormons, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> is skeptical of the church's claim of a divine origin for the doctrine `` I choose to look at it as something that man placed and God removed,'' he said, echoing a view shared by independent Mormon scholars and at least one high-ranking church official. The late <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a member of the Council of the Twelve and a counselor to former church President <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>, never accepted the ban as doctrine and nearly engineered its reversal, said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s grandson, <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Firmage </PERSON>. Ten members of the Twelve, which assists the governing First Presidency, voted to lift the ban in 1969. <PERSON> Firmage </PERSON> said the vote was nullified when the council's senior active member, <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, returned to town. Little evidence indicates the policy originated with church founder <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>; it was not among the dozens of written revelations he left before his 1844 assassination in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. As articulated by <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s successor, <ORGANIZATION> Brigham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION>, the ban was rooted in the belief that black Africans were descendants of the biblical Cain, cursed by <PERSON> God </PERSON> for murdering his brother, <PERSON> Abel </PERSON>. Church leaders in 1969 reiterated the policy was divine doctrine taught by <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and every succeeding Mormon prophet, but by 1978, months before the ban's demise, they were saying that only God knew the reason why. A decade later, that apparently remains the official view. Elder <PERSON> Dallin </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Oaks </PERSON>, a member of the Twelve, said in an interview that theological arguments trying to buttress the doctrine were largely speculative. God does n't give reasons for his revelations, he said. `` We can put reason to revelation. We can put reasons to commandments. When we do, we're on our own. Some people put reasons to the one we're talking about here and they turned out to be spectacularly wrong,'' <PERSON> Oaks </PERSON> said. Mormons define priesthood as the authority to act in the name of God, and membership is a prerequisite to any appointment in the church's lay leadership or to performing such rites as baptism, temple marriage and healing the sick. <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, for instance, was not permitted to bless his infant sons before <PERSON> Kimball </PERSON>'s revelation. A white member of the priesthood gave the blessings instead. `` There were restrictions which, in a worldly sense, were hard to accept,'' said <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, who two days after the ban was lifted became the first black ordained to the faith's priesthood since the faith's infancy, when at least two blacks held priesthood offices. Among Africans, the restriction appears to have made less difference. `` They do n't seem to take it the way I think I would if I had been involved,'' said <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> <PERSON> Clegg </PERSON>, a missionary in <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> in the early 1980s. As early as 1946 the church was receiving inquiries from Nigerians who had read church missionary tracts or articles. The Nigerian government, however, refused to admit missionaries until the policy was dropped. The appeal of Mormonism also spread to <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION>. When missionaries arrived in the two countries, they were greeted by thousands eager for baptism. Among American blacks, memories of the ban haunt missionary efforts. But black and white Mormons alike say economic and social barriers are more divisive than church doctrine. `` I would say that where you have black middle-class converts coming into middle-class congregations, the prognosis is good,'' said <PERSON> Armand </PERSON> <PERSON> Mauss </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> sociologist who has monitored the progress of black Mormons. `` Where you have lower-class blacks being converted to middle-class congregations, that's not good.'' <PERSON> Mauss </PERSON> cited surveys taken from 1972 to 1985 by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opinion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> that suggested white Mormons were slightly more tolerant of blacks than non-Mormon whites. But when racial tensions flare, they take their toll of fledgling black converts alreay sensitive to the church's image among non-Mormon friends and relatives. In <LOCATION> Greensboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, black baptisms averaged six to 12 a month in the early 1980s, but a majority fell away after racial incidents, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON>, a black who sits on the high council of the <LOCATION> Greensboro </LOCATION> Stake, or diocese. Among those who left the church was <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON>'s wife, taunted with epithets by 11-year-olds she was teaching in Primary, the church's organization for children `` A very few whites, two or three, were still prejudiced and they let the blacks know it. It made the rest of the whites feel bad because the blacks were judging the church by them,'' said <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON>, a member of eight years. Worried at the erosion among black converts, local leaders offered them a choice, to continue attending mixed congregations or form their own with black leaders. They unanimously picked the latter. Since then, the number of active black participants has risen from about 50 to more than 200.

 As promised as long as a decade ago, the deregulation of the `` financial services'' industry has given savers and investors many new ways to go about the business of managing their money. If you want a traditional bank product like a certificate of deposit, for example, you may well find it these days at a securities brokerage firm. Conversely, when you shop for an investment vehicle like a mutual fund, you might end up buying it through a bank. The benefits in convenience seem clear. And the enhanced competition, in theory at least, should work to the investor's benefit But observers of the financial scene say the new entrants in a given field do n't always offer a better deal than their old-line counterparts. As the choices have multiplied, they say, so have the number of variables to be considered, and questions to be asked, before you commit your money. Consider CDs sold by brokers _ an idea that raises some intriguing possibilities. A large brokerage firm can comb the country for certificates with attractive yields, and then make them available to customers in any of its branches. Wherever it goes, the CD carries with it <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> covering up to $ 100,000 per account. Since the bank pays the brokerage firm for its services, you normally do n't have to pay any commission to buy a CD from the broker. Now suppose you run into circumstances that make it desirable, or necessary, for you to cash in the CD before it matures. If you go directly to the issuing bank, you will have to pay the legendary `` substantial penalty for early withdrawal.'' But the broker may be able to circumvent that problem by selling the CD for you to some other customer. The emphasis in that last sentence, however, should be placed on the `` may be able.'' Some, but not all, brokers handling CDs offer this option. Even if you can unload the CD this way, you may have to sell it at a loss from your purchase price if interest rates have risen in the interim. That loss may be increased by fees or markdowns charged by the broker in handling the transaction. It also bears remembering that the broker is only an intermediary. If the issuer of the CD gets into financial difficulty, it will be left to you to deal with the bank or federal regulators. When you buy through a broker this way, furthermore, you open an account that makes you part of the firm's `` customer base.'' Says the newsletter 100 Highest Yields, `` If you open your account at a full-service brokerage house, there's a good chance you'll be getting occasional sales calls from your brokerage firm.'' On the other side of the coin, what about buying mutual funds through a bank? Technically, banks are still legally barred from selling securities products like these, but many have found ways to do so by forging links with mutual fund sponsors. A bank may offer a handy way to do your mutual fund investing. It may sweeten the pot by counting your fund balance as an offset to fees it might otherwise charge you for services such as checking. But does a given bank's selection include all the best-run funds that are available directly from fund sponsors? Are the bank's funds new, lacking performance records to serve as a rough gauge of how they might fare in the future While there may be many good reasons to consider buying mutual fund shares at a bank, says the newsletter Wiesenberger Mutual Funds Investment Report, `` it is almost certain that funds offered through joint ventures will have higher distribution expenses.'' `` After all, there is another middleman who has to be paid for taking your money.'' Also, it adds, `` trying to resolve statement errors or purchase-sell requests could be a big headache if bank personnel are not well versed in the mechanics'' of handling fund accounts.

 Going into the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> primary, the Democratic presidential candidates still running include Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> who? You remember <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON>, that up-and-coming dark horse, the former congressman. The baby boomer candidate whose slogan is `` For Real.'' You wo n't find <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> on the ballot, but he's listed in newspaper television schedules: <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> is running only on Home Box Office. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> stars in `` Tanner'88,'' an HBO series being filmed on the campaign trail and occasionally mixing fiction with reality. It is a collaboration between `` Doonesbury'' cartoonist <PERSON> Garry </PERSON> <PERSON> Trudeau </PERSON>, who is writing it, and director <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Altman </PERSON> -LRB- `` M-A-S-H,'' `` <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>'' -RRB-. A new episode has premiered once a month since the series made its debut the eve of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary. <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION> will run all five episodes so far in a <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> marathon this Saturday. <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION> viewers will be able to vote for <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> or any of the real candidates by calling an 800 number on Saturday. <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellerbee </PERSON> will anchor little `` news'' breaks giving updates on the poll. The first of two episodes shot in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> will run on <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION> on Monday, the day before the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> primary. A post-California primary show will premiere Monday, June 20. The first <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> show includes a candidates debate, moderated by <PERSON> Ellerbee </PERSON>. Footage was taken from an earlier real-life debate, and the other candidates cut out and <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> edited in. `` You see me getting ready for it,'' said <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, who plays the attractive if somewhat hapless candidate. `` You see me talking to two people sitting on stage. The way they cut the tape together it looks like the real thing. Then <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellerbee </PERSON> comes backstage and we play a scene together. It's so unbelievably well-shot that it appears realistic.'' <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON>, who is divorced, has a girlfriend who had been a secret until it was discovered that she worked for the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign. `` We do get found out in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, so as the second episode ends the press is madly on my tail because they think a scandal is about to break,'' he said. `` I keep defending myself. I say I'm not <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>. I do n't want to be compared with him. I say I'm going to marry the girl. A wedding is planned but it looks like it might fall through.'' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> talked by telephone from <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, where he had gone for a few weeks' rest after filming the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> episodes. `` We film two weeks and then take two weeks off,'' he said, `` so it's not as brutal as working every day. It's set up very much like a real campaign. We have advance men who go in and set things up. <PERSON> Garry </PERSON> writes the scripts, although we do adapt things as we see them. It's like found art.'' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> describes <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> as `` an idealistic, decent person who's a kind of amiable goofus. He said, `` He's gotten stronger. He's taken lessons from the same people who worked with <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> The one thing I safeguard is to see that <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> stays a decent guy. `` The drift of the show is that you see a guy being pushed and pulled by his people and the media and other politicians. And how he reacts to it.'' He called it a `` dream job'' with `` absolutely no interference from anyone.'' <PERSON> Altman </PERSON> said on a recent visit to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that he would like <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> to keep running even after the Democratic convention by becoming an independent candidate. `` I do n't know anything like it that has ever quite been done before,'' he said of the series. `` I think we are breaking a little ground. I know I'm having the most fun I've had in 20 years.'' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, who starred last year in the short-lived CBS series `` Hard Copy,'' appeared in many of <PERSON> Altman </PERSON>'s early films. Most recently the two teamed up for the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> special `` The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial'' in which <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> played a judge.

 They are being bombarded with sales pitches for everything from book-of-the-month clubs to cognac. Like blacks and Hispanics before them, Asians in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have become a hot market for advertisers, triggering a media blitz that aims to penetrate cultural differences within the group and tap a wellspring of discretionary income. `` We've gone up 100 percent for the past five years in a row,'' said advertising executive <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoner </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> Artesa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> specializes in <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> and Hispanic advertising. His firm's billings for advertising to Filipinos, Chinese, Koreans, Japanese, Vietnamese and other Asian-American groups range between $ 350,000 and $ 400,000, up from $ 35,000 to $ 50,000 just five years ago, <PERSON> Stoner </PERSON> said. Much of the advertising is for ethnic products, local merchants, real estate agents and other businesses catering to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Asians. But more mainstream companies are testing campaigns in Korean, Chinese, Japanese and other Asian languages. `` Companies that are driven by numbers say it is too small a segment to contend with,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sladkus </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> advertising representative for 30 Asian print and broadcast media nationwide. `` Other companies are looking at them very seriously as new consumers.'' <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T, <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Remy </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> cognac are among advertisers who have crossed over with appeals geared to Asian-American consumers. The reason? Although Asian-Americans are a relatively small piece of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population, their steep growth rate and favorable demographics make them blue-chip consumers for many products. The advertising upswing has touched off sharp growth in Asian-targeted media, especially in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> counties, which topped the nation with 550,000 Asian-Americans as of the 1980 census, when the national figure was 3.5 million. That was up from 1.4 million in 1970, according to an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> report that projected Asian-Americans will total 6.5 million by 1990 and 10 million by 2000. `` We used to have two Chinese -LRB- newspaper -RRB- dailies'' in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Stoner </PERSON>. `` Now we have six, three full-bore Korean dailies, three Japanese dailies and even a Vietnamese daily.'' Though broadcasting has not developed as sharply, some radio stations and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> television station <ORGANIZATION> KSCI </ORGANIZATION> broadcast programs in Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Filipino, Vietnamese and Cambodian. `` Cable -LRB- television -RRB- is the next step,'' said <PERSON> Stoner </PERSON>. `` And as of 1989 there will be pay television in their languages in every major -LRB- Asian-American -RRB- metropolitan area in the country: <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and Seattle-Vancouver.'' <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, whose <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> agency researches the Asian-American market for major advertising campaigns, said about 75 percent of Asian-Americans were born outside the country, `` except for the Japanese, which are 20 percent first generation.'' Newcomers are said to be more responsive to advertising about what to buy and where to find it. With larger household sizes and more workers in the home, median family income for almost all <LOCATION> Asian-American </LOCATION> groups is better than average. They also have more education and better jobs than national norms. But differences in language, culture, nationality and assimilation level can make reaching and persuading Asian-Americans a tough job for advertisers. Different languages mean they can not be targeted with just one appeal, as Hispanics are in Spanish. `` Many times the current copy just does n't fly with the <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> population,'' said <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>. `` The word ` Chevy' was not recognized by first-generation Koreans. So we translated it to ` It's a Chevrolet. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s finest line of cars.''' Other campaigns lose something in the translation or communicate the wrong message. <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> magazine ran a New Year's greeting in Chinese that had the characters in the wrong order Some overseas campaigns ran into even more trouble. Colonel <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> `` finger-lickin' good'' fried chicken slogan once was translated `` something like ` eat your fingers off''' and <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cola </ORGANIZATION>'s `` come alive'' generation became `` wakes your ancestors up from the dead,'' <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said. Some agencies have solved that problem by tailoring ads to suit the peculiarities of different subgroups. And even while wooing new consumers, Madison Avenue still could improve its image of Asians in mainstream advertising, said <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Alligood </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> BBDO </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for special markets in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Advertisers are approving a lot of ads that are in questionable taste, the Japanese in particular,'' said <PERSON> Alligood </PERSON>. `` Japanese men with little round glasses and buck teeth. There's no room for that.''

 It will be hard to top the color and drama of his fourth U.S.-Soviet summit, but President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s aides and backers say he will have plenty to keep him busy until he leaves office 7 -LCB- months from now. There's just a chance that his schedule might include a fifth meeting with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to sign a treaty reducing superpower arsenals of long-range nuclear missiles. `` I think what we are seeing is that <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has not yet reached the peak of his powers or his accomplishments,'' says <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, the president's former top domestic policy adviser and author of a book about his administration. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s agenda will include an economic summit meeting with leaders of the industrialized Western democracies and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, campaign trips on behalf of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and other Republican candidates and a brief appearance at the GOP convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. He is also expected to squeeze in four more vacation trips to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> before he turns over the reins to his successor at noon next Jan. 20. As they have for many months, the president and his aides also say that efforts continue to secure the freedom of nine American hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Administration efforts to force Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> from power, which collapsed as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was on his way to the summit, may also be resumed. On the president's immediate schedule are a couple of speeches in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in which he will report on his <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> visit. Details of the speeches had not been announced as the president prepared to leave <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Still up in the air was the future of a proposed treaty reducing intercontinental ballistic missile arsenals by 30 to 50 percent, which both sides had originally said they hoped might be signed during the meetings in the Kremlin. `` We are both hopeful that it can be finished before I leave office,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told students at <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` But I assure you that if it is n't ... I will have impressed on my successor that we must carry on until it is signed.'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, interviewed by telephone at the <ORGANIZATION> Hoover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, where he is a senior fellow, said, `` I would predict that he and General Secretary <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> are going to be working even harder to put together a reduction in the big weapons.'' `` They may not get to the full 50 percent but I would n't be surprised if they did get some agreement,'' said <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, who in his recent book, `` Revolution,'' depicted nuclear arms reduction as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s overriding concern during his presidency. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who first met in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in 1985 and subsequently got together in <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>, and in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> before their session in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, have indicated they would be willing to meet again to sign such a treaty. With difficult negotiations still ahead, no concrete plans have been made, but some sources have suggested <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, as a possible site. More immediately, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will meet in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> June 19-21 with heads of government from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> for the 14th annual economic summit. With the exception of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, he will have been in office longer than any of them. `` There are no burning issues,'' said one administration official. `` It's a ` where we have been and where we are going' kind of thing.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s speech at the Republican National Convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> Aug. 15-18 is expected to be a brief drop-in enroute to his annual August vacation at his ranch north of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. He is also expected to visit the ranch in July and, as usual, spend Thanksgiving there and round out the year at the home of old friend <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Annenberg </PERSON> in Rancho Mirage, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The president is expected to make campaign appearances on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s behalf after the vice president's expected nomination at the convention `` Nothing has been scheduled, but he will be doing campaigning for the vice president and a lot of campaigning for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> candidates,'' Deputy White House Press Secretarty B.J. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said. It does not sound as dramatic as meeting with refuseniks in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, dueling with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> inside the Kremlin walls or answering barbed questions from Soviet students. But, as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in a May 2 speech to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> reviewing his administration's accomplishments, `` We are n't at the end yet.''

<HEAD>Macmillan Restructuring Could Leave Room for Bid by Bass, Others</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s new billion-dollar restructuring plan, designed to thwart a hostile takeover bid by <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bass </PERSON>, leaves the door open for higher bids from Bass or other potential suitors, some analysts believe. The venerable publishing giant announced Tuesday that its board of directors had adopted a plan to split the company's publishing and non-publishing operations into two separate, publicly owned corporations and to pay special dividends to shareholders. <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> valued the dividends and securities to be paid under the restructuring plan at more than $ 64 a share, or over $ 1.66 billion. Some analysts who follow the company estimated the plan would be worth $ 65 to $ 70 a share. <PERSON> Bass </PERSON>, who leads a group of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> investors that launched a bid for <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> in mid-May, offered $ 64 a share for <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION>'s roughly 26 million outstanding shares The bid by the Bass group _ which holds 9.1 percent of the company's shares _ was rejected as inadequate by <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON>'s board. The investor group had no comment on <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON>'s restructuring proposal, said <PERSON> Dee </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, an attorney at the law firm <ORGANIZATION> Kelly </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Hallman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, that is representing the group. The proposed restructuring still leaves room for Bass and other potential suitors to bid for <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON>, but makes the possibility of an offer being supported by management more remote, said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorp </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Provident </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. `` This really puts pressure on -LRB- potential suitors -RRB- for time,'' <PERSON> Thorp </PERSON> said. Other possible bidders cited by market watchers are competitors <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> media tycoon <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>. Bass is keenly interested in <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON>'s information services business, the company's fastest-growing and most profitable area, according to analysts. The business, which publishes reference books such as Who's Who and trade guides for lawyers, had sales of $ 229 million in 1987 _ up from $ 146 million two years before. Under the restructuring plan, the two new companies would be called <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION>, now a subsidiary of the parent, would be `` spun off'' as a dividend to shareholders For each share of existing <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> stock, shareholders would receive a cash dividend of $ 52.35, a half-share of common stock in the new <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION>, and $ 4.50 principal amount of <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> subordinated debentures. The cash dividend of $ 52.35 consists of $ 25.20 from <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and $ 27.15 from <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> stock dropped $ 2.25 a share Tuesday to close at $ 70.25 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. There had been rumors on Wall Street that <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON>'s management might be planning to buy the company from shareholders, speculation that had sent the stock up $ 2.37 -LCB- a share on Friday. <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> said it had obtained commitments for all the financing needed to pay the special dividends. The company said the restructuring plan had been under study for a year, but analysts suggested the timing of the decision likely meant it was taken to counter the Bass bid. `` I think the timing was a reaction to Bass,'' said <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Boksen </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Raymond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. He called the restructuring `` a reasonable deal.'' A takeover by <PERSON> Bass </PERSON>, <PERSON> Boksen </PERSON> suggested, would have boosted <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> shares to $ 80 to $ 90 _ while the restructuring could lift them to around $ 80. <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> told shareholders at the annual meeting on May 18 that the company was not for sale. The shareholders approved a proposal by management to authorize the issuance of additional stock in <LOCATION> Macmillan </LOCATION>, as a defense against hostile takeovers. Under the restructuring plan, <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> would include the information services, textbook and retail businesses currently owned by the parent. The operating managements of <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> would remain the same as in the current subsidiaries, and senior management would continue in their positions. The company had revenue of $ 469.4 million from its publishing operations and $ 486.4 million from its information businesses in 1987.

<HEAD>Analysts Scramble to Explain Reasons for Latest Stock Rally</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The stock market broke out of its May doldrums with a buying spree that carried the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average to its second biggest gain of the year. But analysts were hard-pressed to come up with an explanation for Tuesday's surge, which came on the heaviest daily volume since late January. `` Sometimes it's better just to enjoy and not analyze things like this,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a portfolio strategist for <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` It's been a bad May.'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> DaPuzzo </PERSON>, manager of retail equity trading for <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the warm weather over the Memorial Day holiday may have brightened investors' outlooks and prompted them to put some cash to work. `` You've got to start a summer rally sometime, and Memorial Day is usually the threshold to the summer,'' he said. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 74.68 on Tuesday to 2,031.12, its highest level since it closed at 2,036.31 on May 4. It was the biggest one-day advance in the market's most widely-followed index since a 76.42-point gain on Jan. 4, the first trading day of the year, and the sixth biggest rise ever. The gain in the Dow Jones industrials was so strong that a voluntary limit on computerized program trading was triggered when the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION>'s rise swept past 50 points in the last hour of trading. But even after the so-called `` collar'' went into effect for the rest of the day, the blue-chip average extended its gain. It was the third time the collar had gone into effect since it was adopted in the aftermath of the Oct. 19 market crash in a bid to curb market volatility. Gainers outpaced losers by nearly 4 to 1 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 1,211 up, 333 down and 401 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> came to 247.61 million shares, up from 133.59 million in the previous session and the highest since 275.25 million shares were traded there on Jan. 25. Two utility stocks with dividend deadlines approaching accounted for about 90 million shares of volume. Nonetheless, volume was up from the sluggish pace of recent weeks that has prompted speculation that brokerage firms may resort to a round of layoffs. Analysts had been saying that the slow pace of trading reflected investors' uncertainty about the implications of continued strength in the economy. While a strong economy could bode well for corporate profits, some investors worried that it could also reignite inflation and prompt the <ORGANIZATION> Fdederal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to choke it off by encouraging higher interest rates. Even as stock prices and trading volume swelled on Tuesday, some potential ingredients for a new surge in inflation were evident. Commodity futures prices surged, propelling a key inflation indicator, the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>'s index of 21 commodities, to a three-year high. But that failed to dampen enthusiasm in the stock market. Analysts said stock traders were heartened by the dollar's continuing stability and the bond market's resilience in the face of rising commodity prices Recent declines in bond prices have pushed their yields higher and made them more competitive with stocks for investors' money. They also cited relief that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> failed to boost its discount rate _ its interest charge on loans to financial institutions _ as some feared it would after the markets closed last week. <PERSON> Eldon </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grimm </PERSON>, a senior vice president at the brokerage Birr, <ORGANIZATION> Wilson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said there is `` an enormous amount of cash around out of the market'' due to wariness in the wake of last October's crash. `` But every time we get a little rally going, people think they will miss the boat and buy something,'' he said.

 <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> said normal flight schedules would resume today after numerous holiday weekend flights were canceled when flight attendants refused to work end-of-the-month overtime to protest an impasse in contract negotiations. The airline, based at <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, canceled about two dozen of its 1,600 flights Tuesday, said spokesman <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Shipley </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, D.C.-based airline also canceled one flight Saturday, 81 on Sunday and 61 on Memorial Day. `` It's a very, very small percentage of the total,'' <PERSON> Shipley </PERSON> said. `` There's not chaos at the airports.'' <PERSON> Shipley </PERSON> said flight attendants' overtime is governed by federal regulations that limit them to 85 hours per month. He said flight attendants may fly five extra hours per month as overtime at the request of airlines, but they are not required to do so. Since today is the first day of the new month, the flight attendants would revert to their normal work schedules. <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> has yet to complete an agreement for a new contract and seniority list with its flight attendants and those employed by <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, which <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> acquired last year and merged into its system on April 9. `` Apparently there is -LRB- a protest -RRB-, but it's not a union-organized protest. I think it's a spontaneous protest. I was as surprised as anyone else,'' said <PERSON> Juliette </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenoir </PERSON>, vice president of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, D.C.-based union and a <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> flight attendant. `` My best sense is that flight attendants are just very upset at this whole issue of pay parity for the former <ORGANIZATION> PSA </ORGANIZATION> flight attendants. That may have been the straw that broke the camel's back,'' she said Ms. <PERSON> Lenoir </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> also has been asking attendants to do more work, such as serving travelers before takeoff, without a raise in pay since at least 1985. <PERSON> Shipley </PERSON> said most passengers booked on the canceled flights switched to other <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> flights or to other airlines. <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION>'s central operating hub is Greater <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Report Says Traders Raked In Big Profits Despite Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Floor brokers on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> posted their best year ever in 1987 despite the slashing of stock prices during the October market crash, a published report said today. Quoting confidential exchange records, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said the 54 `` specialist'' firms collectively lost $ 166.7 million in October but still managed to post profits of $ 369.3 million before taxes for the year. Specialists are appointed by the exchange to make markets in individual stocks. They are charged with making sure that market is orderly, even if it means buying and selling equities from their own accounts. They have been criticized for not doing more to smoothe out the market during the crash, but specialist advocates have commended their performance during the crisis. Financial data on specialists are kept secret and are not reported to the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> because they are private enterprises, the paper said. The Times said it obtained the data from <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> staff sources who received the confidential records from the exchange as part of a continuing investigation into the crash. According to figures provided to the Times, specialists earned $ 1.85 billion before taxes from 1981 through 1987 while their equity capital amounted to $ 923 million at the end of last year. The Times said that indicates they took out of their businesses $ 1.38 billion, not including salaries and expenses. Specialists' returns have not dipped below 30 percent this decade, the paper said. Meanwhile, exchange members who deal with the public and are not specialists had capital of about $ 22.9 billion last year, but their pre-tax return amounted to 4.8 percent, the paper reported. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Grasso </PERSON>, president-elect of the exchange, noted that several new rules have been instituted to boost slightly the capital specialists must have on hand. He told the Times the earnings figures should have been lower because they did not take into account payments partners in the specialist firms made to themselves as a return on their investments.

<TEXT>
 The debut of the Turbo Coupe, a Chrysler-styled, Maserati-built luxury sports car, has been hit with another delay and probably wo n't show up in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> showrooms until late summer. The trade journal <ORGANIZATION> Automotive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported this week that the $ 30,000 coupe's launch was delayed for two more months because of snags involved in a hard top as a no-cost option and by other last-minute refinements. The car comes with no other options. `` We experienced a bit of difficulty with the hard top,'' <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Lamborghini </PERSON> and Maserati programs, told the trade journal. The Maserati-Chrysler hybrid was scheduled for introduction in mid-May on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> but wo n't appear until the end of July _ well into the warm weather selling season for convertibles. The car, once planned for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> launch in early 1987, went into production in low volume at <LOCATION> Maserati </LOCATION>'s Innocenti plant in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, earlier this month. The car will be sold and serviced by 300 Chrysler dealers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and 30 in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> plans to sell about 5,000 to 6,000 of the luxury sports models a year, but the plant has the capacity to build as many as 8,000. The car first was shown in January 1986. Some of the many delays in its introduction included different design ideas held by <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Maserati </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomaso </PERSON>, Automotive News reported.

But <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> and local agencies including <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Counseling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> also are trying to teach workers how to avoid it. About 8,500 Pontiac-area workers are on layoff or will be by 1990, a portion of more than 30,000 <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> workers whose jobs will disappear in closings of at least 16 plants nationwide. Among the advice they receive: Stop using credit cards and prepare a realistic budget that takes into account lower income while benefits are coming in and potentially drastic reductions in income afterward. The lessons are hard for some workers to learn, <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> said. Losing a job `` is a loss just like the other losses we acknowledge, like the loss of a loved one,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonz </PERSON>, employment projects coordinator for <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. Victims experience the same stages of grief _ denial, anger, depression and finally acceptance _ as with other major losses, she said. But with a job loss, `` people have a tendency not to reach out for help available to them. `` There is a desire to hide from the situation. They might bring in the mail, but they do n't really open up the bills. Imagination takes over and makes it seem a worse situation than it is,'' <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonz </PERSON> said. Laid-off workers have hit the wall if they are being threatened with foreclosure, eviction, repossession or bankruptcy. Some give up, <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonz </PERSON> said. But many are directed to <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Counseling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit counseling agency that provides free assessments. Giving up can lead to bankruptcy filings, as many as 50 percent of which are unnecessary, said <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Counseling </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahey </PERSON>, citing a recent study by <ORGANIZATION> Purdue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. The study showed half of 1,199 bankruptcy petitions surveyed had no ability to repay debts; 20 percent could have paid all but mortgage debts in three years, and 25 percent could have repaid 75 percent of their debts in three years, <PERSON> Leheay </PERSON> said. `` Once filed, a bankruptcy stays on the credit record for 10 years and indefinitely for life insurance policies and mortgage credit requests,'' she said.

<HEAD>Help-Wanted Advertising Steady in April</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Help-wanted advertising, an indication of the demand for labor, held steady in April, the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday. The Board's Help-Wanted index, unchanged from the previous month, measures the volume of classified advertising in 51 major newspapers nationwide. But trends in the labor market continue to confound experts. `` While help-wanted advertising volume has shown no significant strength since last November, employment continues to rise,'' noted <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> economist <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported April's unemployment rate was 5.4 percent, down from 5.6 percent in March. `` The best odds still favor a slowing of employment growth in the coming months, rather than a spurt in want-ad volume,'' he said. Advertising volume rose in five of the nine geographic regions measured, with the East South Central region posting the largest gain of 5.5 percent. It was followed by the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>, where help-wanted advertising rose 2.9 percent, and the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> region, up 1.7 percent. The <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> region registered the greatest decline of 5.8 percent.

<HEAD>US Firms Continue To Attract Foreign Buyers</HEAD>

 American businesses continue to attract high levels of foreign investment, in part because of the cheaper dollar and favorable <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic conditions, the government says. Foreigners spent $ 30.5 billion in 1987 to acquire or establish businesses in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. That was down 22 percent from the record $ 39.2 billion in 1986, but nearly four times greater than the 1983 level of $ 8.1 billion. The driving force behind the big jump in foreign investment has been this country's huge trade deficit, which hit a record $ 171.2 billion last year. Foreigners have looked for ways to invest their dollars, earned through sales to Americans. As a consequence, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has moved from the world's largest creditor to the world's largest debtor. The report identified four factors that made <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses attractive to foreigners last year: _ The continued depreciation of the dollar encouraged foreign companies to shift operations to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> so that their expenses as well as sales were paid in dollars _ Moderate inflation and an expanding economy made prospects for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses look good _ Continuing takeover activity created opportunities for purchases _ And, fear that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would enact legislation to restrict imports likely motivated foreign companies to produce in, rather than export to, this country Analysts read little significance into the decline from 1986, cautioning that tax law changes and other factors may have held down the reported number for 1987. `` Everybody was trying to close deals in 1986 because of tax considerations, so it's quite possible that 1986 just borrowed some sales from 1987,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Herr </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> analyst, said if past years are any guide, the 1987 total will be revised upward by 10 percent or more as additional deals are reported to the government. The 1986 figure had originally been reported at $ 31.5 billion, nearly 20 percent less than the revised figure released Tuesday. <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> said foreign investment would likely increase again in 1988 because of the continued fall of the dollar, which has lost about half of its value since 1985 as measured against the Japanese yen. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> right now looks like a very competitive place to produce. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies, especially when you look at them in yen terms, look very cheap and you're going to see continued strong buying,'' he said. Foreigners also have been buying corporate bonds, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> notes, stocks and other investments that do not show up in the report released Tuesday. It tracks money spent to establish new businesses or purchase a 10 percent or greater stake in existing companies. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses acquired or established by foreigners in 1987 employed 346,000 workers and owned 316,000 acres of land. The report showed that <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> was the largest purchaser at $ 11.5 billion, up from $ 8.6 billion in 1986. It was followed by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> with $ 5.3 billion, down from $ 5.4 billion a year earlier; and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, $ 4.1 billion, up from $ 1.4 billion. Investment by all European nations dropped to $ 19.5 billion from $ 21.1 billion. Canadian investment, which was $ 6.5 billion in 1986, was reported at $ 849 million last year. <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> cautioned that the figures for individual countries can swing widely from year to year based on a single large deal or on difficulties in collecting information. The largest investment, by industry group, was in manufacturing _ particularly chemical and food companies _ at $ 16.3 billion, down 6 percent from 1986. Overseas investment in banking and finance dipped to $ 1.9 billion from $ 2.1 billion. In retail trade, purchases by foreigners totaled $ 682 million, a big drop from $ 5.2 billion in 1986. Real estate investment was $ 2.9 billion in 1987, down from $ 5.2 billion. According to the report, much of the Japanese investment was concentrated in real estate, particularly <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> office buildings and hotels in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Farm Prices Mark 3.1 Percent Increase</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Raw farm products in May brought prices 3.1 percent above the April average and 4.7 percent over those of the same time last year, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reports. Prices paid to farmers averaged 134 percent of a 1977 base used for comparison, according to the preliminary figures released Tuesday by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. A year ago the index was 128. `` Higher prices for hogs, oranges, soybeans and broilers were partially offset by lower prices for tomatoes, onions, milk and upland cotton,'' it said. Hog prices reached their highest levels since October while cattle rose to their highest since May 1979. Soybeans shot up sharply. Livestock and poultry prices were up 2.7 percent from both April and May 1987, according to the preliminary figures, based mainly on mid-month averages. `` Higher prices for hogs, broilers and beef cattle more than offset lower prices for milk, eggs and calves,'' <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> said. Crop prices overall were up 4.5 percent from April and 7.4 percent above the levels of a year ago. For oil-bearing crops, primarily soybeans, the price index was up 7.4 percent from the previous month and 26 percent above the May 1987 level. But there was a 12 percent drop in prices paid to commercial vegetable producers from April's levels and 11 percent from last year. <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> attributed most of the change to lower prices for tomatoes, onions and sweet corn. The report also said: Cattle averaged $ 70 per 100 pounds of live weight nationally, up from $ 69 in April and above the $ 63 reported for May 1987. Those are averages for all types of cattle sold as beef. Hogs averaged $ 46.90 per 100 pounds, compared with $ 41.90 in March and $ 54.40 a year earlier. Corn, at $ 1.89 a bushel, was up from $ 1.88 in April and well over last year's mark of $ 1.66. Wheat prices at the farm, according to the preliminary figures, averaged $ 2.83 a bushel, up from $ 2.79 last month and $ 2.66 a year earlier. Rice averaged $ 8.27 per 100 pounds, down slightly from $ 8.33 last month but still far above the year-ago figure, which was $ 3.71. Soybeans were reported at $ 6.98 a bushel compared to $ 6.40 last month and $ 5.20 in May 1987. Upland cotton averaged 56.4 cents a pounds, a decrease from 59.4 cents in April and 60 cents a year earlier. Eggs were 43.1 cents a dozen, down from 45.5 cents in April, and 49.3 cents in May 1987. Milk was reported at $ 11.75 per 100 pounds, an increase from $ 11.72 last month but a decrease from $ 12.37 a year earlier. Broilers were 33.5 cents a pound, up from 28 cents last month and 29.9 cents in May 1987.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is indicating that it is prepared to assist farmers by easing curbs on the use of land idled under conservation programs. The department indicated Tuesday it is prepared to ease a ban on hay production and cattle grazing on such land in counties found to be suffering from a natural disaster that harms pasture and forage crops. The statement reflected rising concern over a drought hitting major portions of the midcontinent from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to the Canadian border and as far west as <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. Thus far, however, no disaster counties have been declared. The statement from <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hertz </PERSON>, administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stabilization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, mainly outlined possibilities already open to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>. It contained no new programs. The 1985 Farm Act requires farmers to devote part of their land to conservation uses if they are to be eligible for federal payments. The acreage involved varies from one crop to another. For example, it is 27.5 percent for wheat. Producers also receive payments for placing certain land in the long-term Conservation Reserve Program. Haying and grazing are banned on acreage devoted to conservation programs, mainly because farmers already derive economic benefit from the land in the form of government payments. But <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> may make exceptions. In counties found to be suffering from a disaster, <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION> said, `` haying and grazing will be allowed for any consecutive five-month period between April 1 and October 1.'' He said determination of eligible counties will be made on a case-by-case basis.

<HEAD>Centel Dismisses Takeover Offer as Not Credible</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Centel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> officials dismissed a $ 2.8 billion cash takeover bid from an investment group as not credible and as a mere tactical device in a proxy fight. Reaction on Wall Street was also skeptical. <ORGANIZATION> Centel </ORGANIZATION> stock rose $ 4.87 -LCB- a share to close at $ 50 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday, but that was $ 15 below the price offered by the investment group led by <PERSON> Asher </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindemann </PERSON>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frazee </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Centel </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman, said the offer was an apparent attempt to aid efforts by <PERSON> Lindemann </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> to gain three seats on <ORGANIZATION> Centel </ORGANIZATION>'s 11-member board of directors. <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lindemann </PERSON> said in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Centel </ORGANIZATION> management that their investment group was willing to pay $ 65 a share for each of <ORGANIZATION> Centel </ORGANIZATION>'s approximately 43 million shares outstanding. But they conditioned the offer on <ORGANIZATION> Centel </ORGANIZATION>'s canceling an agreement to pay $ 763 million to buy <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telespectrum </ORGANIZATION>, the cellular telephone subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. They said they would drop the bid to $ 60 a share if <ORGANIZATION> Centel </ORGANIZATION> held to the deal, which was announced Friday. `` We believe the investment community overall reacted favorably to our announcement regarding our proposed acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telespectrum </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Frazee </PERSON> said in a statement. `` Our decision was part of our strategic repositioning that follows closely our overall business plan to emphasize three main lines of business _ cellular communications, cable television and local exchange telephone service.'' That business plan in the long term would provide a far better return for investors than any short-term gain under <PERSON> Lindemann </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>'s proposal to sell off company assets to boost stock value, <PERSON> Frazee </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> is a financier who lives in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lindemann </PERSON> is chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> CTS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a New York-based mobile-phone business. Their group holds 5.5 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Centel </ORGANIZATION>'s stock. <ORGANIZATION> Centel </ORGANIZATION> also announced plans Friday to sell its <ORGANIZATION> Centel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> division </ORGANIZATION>, which executives had said could quiet dissident shareholders who have called for a breakup of the company. In their letter, <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lindemann </PERSON> criticized <ORGANIZATION> Centel </ORGANIZATION>'s plan to acquire <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telespectrum </ORGANIZATION> and its $ 9.5 million debt. In light of that plan, they wrote, `` it is apparent to us that management is not operating the company with shareholder values in mind. This acquisition is overpriced and substantially reduces shareholder values.'' The letter said the takeover offer was designed `` to maximize the values of the company,'' but <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lindemann </PERSON> also said the offer was subject to financing being arranged and to regulatory approval. They said said that if the offer were accepted, the group would seek to dispose of <ORGANIZATION> Centel </ORGANIZATION> assets under the program they previously urged. `` This is a friendly overture towards acquiring the company,'' <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` It's very friendly to the company. I'm not sure it would be friendly to the management.'' He would not comment on the group's next move if <ORGANIZATION> Centel </ORGANIZATION> offered no response by the June 10 deadline set in the letter. In a statement, <PERSON> Frazee </PERSON> said, `` We feel the actions by <PERSON> Lindemann </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> today should not distract attention from the basic issue before the shareowners regarding <ORGANIZATION> Centel </ORGANIZATION>'s future and the need to re-elect directors who are committed to our strategic plan to maximize shareowner values.'' And in an interview, he said, `` We believe that our track record of enhancing shareowner value in the past is very solid.'' In an earlier statement, <ORGANIZATION> Centel </ORGANIZATION> said the acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telespectrum </ORGANIZATION> would increase <ORGANIZATION> Centel </ORGANIZATION>'s presence in cellular phone markets in the Southeast and give it a foothold in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, including <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and nearby areas of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which waged a three-month war to avoid a takeover bid by British industrialist <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Beazer </PERSON>, now appears ready to accept a slightly improved offer to sell the company to <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> affiliate <ORGANIZATION> BNS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> officials reportedly favor a bid $ 1-per-share higher than BNS's latest offer over an internal plan to restructure and remain independent, the <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-Gazette </ORGANIZATION> reported <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Tenley </PERSON> refused to confirm an agreement had been reached between the two companies, which battled publicly for months via advertisements in major newspapers and trade publications. `` We have n't decided what to do yet,'' <PERSON> Tenley </PERSON> said. `` We're still reviewing our options We're reviewing capitalization, our litigation and any other options.'' The companies would confirm only that `` serious negotiations'' aimed at reaching an agreement began in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> over the Memorial Day holiday weekend. Before the negotiations began, <ORGANIZATION> BNS </ORGANIZATION> had twice raised its bid for the Pittsburgh-based construction and chemical company, from an original $ 45 per share to $ 60 per share. The weekend talks reportedly produced a $ 61-per-share offer. `` Such negotiations are expected to continue although there can be no assurance that such negotiations will result in a mutually acceptable agreement,'' the companies said Tuesday in a one paragraph statement. <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Gara </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>' goal is still to keep the outcome of the discussions in the best interests of shareholders, employees and the <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> area. `` All I can say is that serious negotiations and talks are continuing,'' he said. BNS had extended its $ 1.7 billion, or $ 60 per share, tender offer through Wednesday, saying it either owns or has offers to buy 80 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>' common shares. BNS is owned by <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION>. As part of the deal, <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to compensate <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>' top officials and employees, a package reportedly worth from $ 70 million to $ 100 million over 12 months, the <ORGANIZATION> Post-Gazette </ORGANIZATION> reported Earlier, <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> said a federal appeals court in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> had lifted one of the legal roadblocks to BNS' takeover bid of <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> said the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled last Friday that <ORGANIZATION> BNS </ORGANIZATION> may proceed with its attempt to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>' stock once a trustee is appointed to control <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>' <ORGANIZATION> Sully-Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contracting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, a quarry and road materials supplier in <LOCATION> Irwindale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION> But <PERSON> O'Gara </PERSON> said the decision imposes further delays on the takeover bid because it said the trustee can not take over the subsidiary until <ORGANIZATION> BNS </ORGANIZATION> acquires a controlling interest in <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION>. Also, <PERSON> O'Gara </PERSON> said, the order states that an injunction issued by Chief <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manuel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Real </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> will remain in force until the trustee is appointed. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Beidler </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> vice president for communications and investor relations, said the firm is pleased with the ruling because it recognized Real's authority to decide the anti-trust issues raised in the case. Sully-Miller is a direct competitor of a company owned by <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, a British construction firm. <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> had filed challenges before Real alleging anti-trust violations. Real is scheduled to hold a hearing on the <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> matter on Wednesday. Another legal roadblock to <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> exists in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, where Judge <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohill </PERSON> halted the BNS bid because of his concerns over financing. He has scheduled hearings for Monday on the legality of the financing involved.

 Oral arguments are scheduled for next week in a federal court lawsuit involving an attempt by <ORGANIZATION> AB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrolux </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> to take over <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> lawn mower and bicycle manufacturer <LOCATION> Murray </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> AB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrolux </ORGANIZATION>, which has made a $ 52-per-share offer, filed suit in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> last week against <ORGANIZATION> Murray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> and its board of directors, including Chairman W.M. <PERSON> Hannon </PERSON> and President J.L. <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>, and various <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> officials. Oral arguments have been set for June 9. The suit asks the court to declare the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Takeover Act and the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Foreign Business Acquisition Act unconstitutional and that <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'s Control Share Acquisition Act be declared inapplicable to <ORGANIZATION> Electrolux </ORGANIZATION>'s tender offer. It also seeks a court order to stop <LOCATION> Murray </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> from using any of those acts to block the purchase of <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> stock. Parties in the suit agreed Tuesday to an expedited discovery process and agreed to file motions by next week on whether the court should abstain in the matter. <ORGANIZATION> Electrolux </ORGANIZATION>'s offer of $ 52 per share to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Murray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> amounts to $ 197.1 million. Also named as defendants in the suit are <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Holderman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Director </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Linda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Page </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Celebrezze </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Tax Commissioner <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Limbach </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Electrolux </ORGANIZATION> also has sued in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> to have the Tennessee Investor Protection Act declared unconstitutional. The act requires a company trying to buy a publicly held company based in the state to file with the <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> before the offer can become effective. <LOCATION> Murray </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, which was incorporated in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> in 1919 and operated in <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION> until 1955, no longer has holdings in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have dismissed as inadequate a new Japanese proposal in the dispute over admitting more American beef to the Japanese market. `` We do n't feel progress has been made,'' a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spokeswoman said Tuesday, as the two countries opened a new round in their prolonged negotiations. Japanese Deputy Agriculture Minister <PERSON> Hidero </PERSON> <PERSON> Maki </PERSON>, who arrived from <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> during the weekend, met for nearly three hours with Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. They agreed to continue talks today, said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s spokeswoman, <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON>. <PERSON> Maki </PERSON>'s new proposal involved raising tariffs on beef to protect Japanese producers from the impact of removing import quotas as demanded by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and his negotiators felt the proposal `` was not adequate to address our concerns,'' Ms. <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON> said, giving no other details. <PERSON> Maki </PERSON> also brought a new proposal to resolve a similar dispute between the two countries over admitting more American oranges and orange juice to the Japanese market. It is under study, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spokeswoman said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had agreed to beef and orange quotas under a 1984 accord that expired at the end of March. Meanwhile, two rounds of negotiations have failed and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has requested <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, to declare the Japanese quotas illegal under international trading rules.

 Share prices were pushing higher at midday Wednesday as dealers took heart from sharp gains on overseas equity markets. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 20 points, or 1.1 percent, at 1,804.4 at 12:30 p.m. local time. Trading volume continued to disappoint the market, as a light 266.2 million shares changing hands by midday, compared with 224.3 million shares at the same time Tuesday. Wednesday's midday rise followed a 74.68-point jump in the Dow Jones industrial average to 2,031.12 on Tuesday and a 287.21-point gain in the Nikkei Index in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> to 27,703.91 Wednesday. A 19.56-point advance in the Hang Seng index in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> to 2,516.24 also heartened market players, several analysts said. The market `` seems to be rejoicing in the gains overnight in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>,'' one dealer said. However, several analysts were skeptical of the recovery and were n't convinced that the market had turned a corner. `` I'm not prepared to say that we're out of the woods quite yet,'' one equity strategist for a major <LOCATION> U.K. </LOCATION> brokerage said. International stocks, including chemical and pharmaceutical issues, were helped by a sinking pound, dealers said.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> _ once one of the wealthiest men in the world _ is telling a federal court jury his version of what led to the world silver market crash in 1980. In his first day of testimony Tuesday in a multimillion dollar civil trial in federal court, <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> essentially repeated assertions made by defense lawyers in their opening statements last February. Lawyers for the other side in the lawsuit will get a crack at trying to shake his story, possibly as soon as today. <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, 62, his brothers <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, 59, and <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, 55, are being sued by a South American silver concern that claims they manipulated the world silver market eight years ago. <ORGANIZATION> Minpeco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.A. </ORGANIZATION>, a mineral marketing company owned by the Peruvian government, claims the three brothers conspired to corner the world silver market in 1979 and 1980. Lawyers for Minpeco claim the Hunts and several co-defendants were responsible for the sharp rise in silver prices from about $ 9 an ounce to more than $ 50 an ounce between September 1979 and January 1980. Minpeco claims the skyrocketing prices caused the company to lose more than $ 100 million when the world silver market collapsed in March 1980, with prices falling back to about $ 10 an ounce. But the elder Hunt brother claimed he began investing in silver bullion and silver futures because of `` continuing inflation and certain political events.'' <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, who said he began investing in silver in 1973, said that by the fall of 1979 he was still telling people that `` silver was an overall good investment.'' But 1979 was `` a very unsettling year, politically,'' <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> said in a low <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> drawl, noting the Iranian revolution that ousted the shah and took American diplomats hostage in <LOCATION> Teheran </LOCATION>, a continuing increase in oil prices, the Soviet invasion of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and the seizure of the Grand Mosque at Mecca by Islamic radicals. Hunt, whose legendary father, H.L. Hunt, made the family fortune in oil, said as oil prices began climbing _ to about $ 30 in late 1979 _ he bought more and more silver. But he claimed that new commodity exchange rules limiting the number of futures contracts that could be held as well as increasing the amount to be put down on margin accounts `` was a difficult thing for the market.''

<TEXT>
 Negotiators for <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> will sign their new 66,000-worker, two-year contract on Monday, the last flourish on a pact that has been in effect since May 16. <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>, along with the elected 10-member <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> bargaining committee, will sign the contract in a 4 p.m. ceremony at <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Highland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> headquarters, company and union officials said. In ratification voting May 11, the contract was approved by a slim 54 percent of those voting overall and rejected by <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s 10,000 skilled trades workers But the contract was ratified later that week by the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION>'s executive board following a skilled trades council meeting in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> because the skilled trades objections were not based on issues that applied solely to them The contract has been in effect since May 16, replacing a three-year pact that would have expired Sept. 14, St. <PERSON> John </PERSON> said. Like the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> pacts on which it is based, the contract guarantees a set number of jobs at each plant, warehouse or office except in cases of cuts in production volume because of slow sales. It also requires the corporation to recall or hire one worker for every two who quit, retire or die. In turn, <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> leaders agreed to end their resistance to plant-level agreements that organize workers into teams. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> has begun taking its initial snapshot of guaranteed jobs at most locations; local union officials will be given lists of workers' names for approval and discussion, St. <PERSON> John </PERSON> said. Unlike the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> pacts, the <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> contract also covers salaried workers including engineers, office and clerical employees and nurses. The two sides began early negotiations April 18 in an effort to ease building tensions sparked by <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s consideration of a $ 2 billion offer to sell its 28,000-worker <ORGANIZATION> Acustar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> parts subsidiary and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to close a 5,500-worker assembly plant in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> backed down from the sale and agreed to early talks in March Despite several disruptions that nearly prompted the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> to break off talks, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> and the union reached a tentative agreement May 4. The early settlement eliminated the chance of a strike in September, which observers said would have been very likely because of the accumulating anger among <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> workers. The new contract expires in 1990, making it the first <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> contract in a decade to expire simultaneously with the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> pacts.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> is back in print _ grumbling about Japanese trade practices, volunteering to pay more taxes and revealing that he once considered a takeover of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>. The new book, `` Talking Straight,'' arrived in bookstores today, about four years after his autobiography conquered the best seller lists. Its initial printing is 750,000; booksellers can only hope that it measures up to `` Iacocca: An Autobiography,'' which has sold 2.6 million hardcover copies and 3.5 million paperbacks worldwide. `` Talking Straight'' picks up about where the autobiography left off. Where the latter retold his firing from <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the new book starts with the <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> chief executive being canned as head of the <ORGANIZATION> Statue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberty-Ellis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centennial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Over 324 pages, <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> also discusses the death of his first wife, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, and his brief second marriage; <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s indictment on charges it sold cars that had been test driven by executives with the odometers disconnected; and his decision not to run for president. But most of the book is given over to <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON>'s musings on <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s problems, rendered in <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON>'s feisty, sometimes profane style. Education, farm policy, the importance of family, the failings of <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> _ <LOCATION> Uncle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lido </LOCATION> has a whole lot of things he wants to get off his chest. _ `` I'm willing to pay more taxes. I can afford it. But what I can not afford is to bury my kids under a dung heap of public debt that will smother them and their kids, and their grandkids _ forever.'' _ American history consists of 20-year upheavals followed by eight years of calm, and the current quietude is ending `` I do n't know if all the banks are going to go out of business or if we're going to start a shooting war, but something pretty bad is likely to happen _ <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> should be told to limit its trade surfeit with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` The idea really constipates free-trade purists, of course,'' he said. _ Corporate takeover specialists often gut well-run companies for quick gains `` We've got to tell our kids to get away from this fast-buck mentality and to start thinking about other people beside themselves.'' Still, <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> does not eschew all mergers -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> has merged with <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> since the last book was written -RRB-. And he writes that last spring, automobile dealer <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Potamkin </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Allied-Signal </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hennessy </PERSON> approached him separately to suggest an unsolicited takeover of the industry behemoth, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>. At first, <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> says, he dismissed the idea. But talks continued, and <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> even met secretly with investment banker <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Rohatyn </PERSON>. He consulted a takeover lawyer and investigated financing before dropping the proposal. `` I concluded that it might be easier to buy <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` Talking Straight'' was written with <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reporter <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleinfield </PERSON> and published by <ORGANIZATION> Bantam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Books </ORGANIZATION>. It is a main selection of the <ORGANIZATION> Book-of-the-Month </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, and foreign rights have been sold so far in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. It costs $ 21.95, but as with the first book, <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> has promised to give all his profits to charity. `` Iacocca'' was one of the publishing phenomenons of the 1980s. The book has been published in 18 languages, `` in countries where they could not properly pronounce <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON>'s name,'' said <PERSON> Bantam </PERSON> publicist <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Applebaum </PERSON>. `` Iacocca'' was on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> best seller list for 80 weeks, 40 of them in the top position.

Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Interest rates on short-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities have risen to the highest level since the October stock market crash. In Tuesday's auction, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sold $ 6.4 billion in three-month bills at an average discount rate of 6.53 percent, up from 6.34 percent last week. Another $ 6.4 billion was sold in six-month bills at an average discount rate of 6.83 percent, up from 6.71 percent last week. The rates were the highest since Oct. 19 when three-month bills sold for 6.84 percent and six-month bills averaged 7.21 percent. The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors _ 6.73 percent for three-month bills with a $ 10,000 bill selling for $ 9,834.90 and 7.17 percent for a six-month bill selling for $ 9,654.70. In a separate report, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday the average yield for one-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills, the most popular index for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages increased to 7.58 percent last week, up from 7.40 percent the previous week.

<TEXT>
 The start of production at the new <ORGANIZATION> Diamond-Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> factory will find robots and humans working together on about 100 pilot cars. As the assembly line begins rolling slowly today, about 400 auto workers will get their first taste of working side by side with robots in the new $ 650 million plant, said <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Skiles </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Diamond-Star </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. The state-of-the-art auto plant features high-technology machinery and equipment including robotics on the final assembly line. Plant supervisors and workers have received intense training courses, including trips to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to study new methods and management techniques. Diamond-Star is scheduled to begin full-scale production of sporty coupes at the new plant the first week in September. <ORGANIZATION> Diamond-Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> is a joint venture of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>. It will build a two-door, front-wheel-drive coupe for the 1989 model year. The car will be sold at prices starting at less than $ 10,000. Ms. <PERSON> Skiles </PERSON> said robots will be tested on an individual basis and programmed for their specific chores. After each is properly performing its task, the robots will be choreographed to get the exact sequence on the assembly line and to perfect their timing. `` The first pilot cars will not come off the assembly line until mid-June,'' she added The pilot cars will be checked closely for design quality and possible production flaws. `` The pilot cars will be used by distributors as show cars and in other media activities,'' she said. `` They will not be for sale to the public.'' <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> will market the vehicle as the <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laser </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sales </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, which has 205 dealerships in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, also will distribute the sports car, but its name has not been announced. Ms. <PERSON> Skiles </PERSON> said Diamond-Star will have about 1,300 employees when its first-shift of employees is on board and will produce upwards of 80,000 in the first 12 months of operation. Eventually, the 2 million-square-foot assembly plant will produce 240,000 cars annually and employ 2,900. Plans call for Diamond-Star to build a compact sedan at its Normal plant beginning in 1989. When it reaches full capacity, the plant will crank out about 63 cars per hour. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> have exchanged parts, engines and cars for nearly 20 years, but the Diamond-Star project marks the first production partnership.

 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s maple syrup industry is threatened by an insect that usually chews on fruit trees but has found sugar maples more to its liking this spring, a plant expert says. `` If you've got a maple tree, you're in trouble,'' said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tattar </PERSON>, a plant pathologist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tree </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> Widespread defoliation blamed on the insect _ called a pear thrips _ has been reported across <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> in the past 10 days, he said Tuesday. `` It's everywhere from <LOCATION> Litchfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, to eastern and western <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and the hills of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Tattar </PERSON> said. `` And we just do n't know very much about it.

 Rising interest rates have come knocking on the housing and construction industries, threatening to blow down five straight years of solid gains in nationwide sales. But economists say the cyclical `` big bad wolf'' is n't likely to cause too much damage in 1988, although the outlook for the next couple of years remains in question. `` It will be a weaker year than it could have been because of interest rates ... but we're still expecting a good year,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON>, chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON> estimated that sales of existing homes would total 3.3 million and new home sales would total 650,000 in 1988, down from 3.65 million and 690,000 respectively last year 1987, but still among the strongest years this decade. A report released Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> departments said that new-home sales climbed 4 percent in April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 679,000 _ the third consecutive rise and the fastest pace since new homes sold at a rate of 728,000 in April 1987. In a report last week, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> said sales of existing homes rose 4.5 percent last month after increases of 2.5 percent in both March and February. While economists said the reports show solid gains, they cautioned that consumers rushed to do their buying then before interest rates headed higher. They said May might not be as strong. `` People are trying to negotiate a settlement and get a mortgage in the face of a fairly certain rise in interest rates,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>, chief economist with the F.W. Dodge Division of <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Mortgage rates are actually slightly lower now than they were a year ago _ averaging about 10.46 percent for a 30-year fixed-rate conventional mortgage, vs. an average 10.60 percent in May 1987, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, known as <ORGANIZATION> Freddie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION> But after falling sharply since the Oct. 19 stock market crash, rates started to creep up again over the past several weeks on fears that the economy may be overheating and inflation might be on the rise. The 30-year mortgage rate, for instance, has risen more than half a percentage point since February, when it averaged 9.89 percent, <ORGANIZATION> Freddie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION> said. Many economists predict mortgage rates will continue to rise through the summer and top 11 percent by the end of the year. A handful are forecasting rates in excess of 12 percent in 1989. At the same time, experts are calling for moderate inflation of around 5 percent this year. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Nothaft </PERSON>, deputy chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> Freddie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION>, said the rise in fixed-rate mortgages may cause some would-be homebuyers to switch to adjustable rate mortgages. He said some savings and loan associations also will become more accommodative, for instance, by requiring smaller down payments or lowering closing costs to encourage sales. <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON> also remains optimistic. He said that the `` Baby Boomers,'' the large segment of the population born after World War II, should remain interested in home buying as their families and incomes expand. But <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Resler </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` I think we're heading downhill in this industry, and eventually the fate of the housing market ... will filter through the rest of the economy as well. `` New homes need to be furnished with durable goods, like refrigerators or washers and dryers,'' he said. The higher rates also threaten new construction contracts, including residential and non-residential units, said <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>. F.W. Dodge reported Tuesday that contracting for new projects declined 6 percent in April from the previous month to an annual rate of $ 226.97 billion, extending a downward slide that began last fall. <PERSON> Bhristie </PERSON> said high vacancy rates in commercial properties, particularly offices and apartments, were responsible for reversing the industry's five-year upswing. But he said rising interest rates will only aggravate the situation since they translate to higher borrowing costs for contractors. `` The export boom which is pumping up the 1988 economy is n't much help to the construction industry, and could even prove troublesome,'' <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> said `` As economic activity heats up, rising interest rates imply still lower building later in the year.''

 The stock market advanced broadly today, following through on Tuesday's strong rally. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 2.13 to 2,033.25 in the first half hour of trading. Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 3 to 1 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 769 up, 223 down and 421 unchanged.

Interest rates fell for the second straight day in the credit markets, reducing yields on long-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds to just above the 9.2 percent level. Analysts said revived enthusiasm for both stocks and bonds was prompted in part by talk that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> was eager to avoid raising its discount rate, despite its other moves of late to tighten credit. Aside from that rationale, many Wall Streeters openly expressed surprise at the market's sudden show of strength on Tuesday.

<HEAD>Dry Weather Cited for Commodity Price Rise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Commodity futures prices have been rising, and analysts are blaming the recent hot, dry weather in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. `` Weather's the story, that's the whole ball game,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader with the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. On Tuesday, advances in prices for future delivery of soybeans, corn, oats, hogs, pork bellies and platinum propelled the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>'s index of 21 commodities to a 5.50-point gain to 248.39 _ the inflation indicator's highest mark since February 1985 Meantime, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that prices farmers got for raw products in May averaged 3.1 percent over April levels and were 4.7 percent over their mark for the same month last year. `` Higher prices for hogs, oranges, soybeans and broilers were partially offset by lower prices for tomatoes, onions, milk and upland cotton,'' the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said. May farm commodity prices averaged 134 percent of a 1977 base used for comparison, according to the preliminary figures. A year ago the index was 128. Consumer food prices are expected to rise 2 percent to 4 percent this year, compared with a 4.2 percent average increase in 1987. But some analysts say if this spring's dry weather turns into a drought, food-price inflation could go higher. Analysts said the buying surges in Tuesday's commodity trading appeared to hit the markets in domino fashion, beginning with grains and soybeans. Soybean futures opened and closed up the 30-cent-a-bushel limit allowed for daily trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in response to the Midwest's hot, dry weekend and predictions for more of the same. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported soybean planting was about 74 percent finished as of Sunday. Traders fear a drier-than-normal summer could lead to tight supplies next year, analysts said. Wheat, corn and oat crops also would suffer during a summer of little rain, but the rapid depletion of soybean stockpiles has made that market particularly sensitive to growing conditions. Tuesday's gains brought the near-month soybean contract, for delivery in July, to within easy striking range of $ 8 a bushel for the first time since the spring of 1984.

<TEXT>
 A rash of good news greeted investors today in the form of a rejuvenated stock market, reports of steady growth in the economy and a perception that interest rates may have stopped rising. On Wall Street the Dow Jones industrial average, which on Tuesday shattered a prolonged post-crash lull by surging nearly 75 points, was up another 13 points by late morning. Broader market indices also extended gains. Also today, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that its chief forecasting gauge of economic activity rose a moderate 0.2 percent in April, signaling solid growth but no danger of recession this year. Economists said the performance of the Index of Leading Indicators was consistent with their belief that the economy was headed for its best year since 1984, as smokestack <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> benefits from a boom in export sales. That strength also was reflected in another <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report today that showed orders to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories rose a strong 1.2 percent in April, the second straight substantial monthly gain. The strength came in electrical machinery, lumber and wood products and in petroleum, chemicals and paper. A third <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report showed construction spending rose 0.1 percent in April, the slowest pace since January. But the figure masked a big rise in factory investment, which was offset by a decline in public spending. Industrial construction is now 39.1 percent higher than a year ago. In recent weeks the financial markets have interpreted signs of surging <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic strength as a harbinger of inflation and rising interest rates, eroding stock and bond prices. But after the three-day Memorial Day weekend investors seemed to reject that view and rushed back to buy stocks and bonds. The spree pushed the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average to its second-biggest gain of 1988. The closely watched blue-chip barometer climbed 74.68 points Tuesday to 2,031.12 _ the highest level since it closed at 2,036.31 on May 4. It was the biggest one-day advance in the Dow average since a 76.42 point gain on Jan. 4, the first trading day of the year, and the sixth-largest rise ever. The rally in the Dow was so strong that a voluntary limit on computerized program trading was triggered when the average's rise swept past 50 points in the last hour of trading. But even after the so-called `` collar'' went into effect for the rest of the day, the blue-chip average extended its gain. New confidence about the near-term outlook for inflation also pushed interest rates lower and lifted bond prices. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s bellwether 30-year bond closed about | point higher, or $ 6.25 for every $ 1,000 in face value, while its yield dropped to 9.23 percent from 9.31 percent late Friday Interest rates on short-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities, however, rose in a government auction to the highest level since the October stock market crash. In other economic developments Tuesday: = The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that prices farmers got for raw products in May averaged 3.1 percent over April levels and were 4.7 percent over their mark for the same month last year = Contracting for new construction projects declined 6 percent in April from March, extending a downward slide that began last fall, according to a survey by the F.W Dodge Division of <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> = The government said foreign purchases of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies dropped 22 percent to $ 30.5 billion in 1987, the first dip since 1983 in the rush by overseas investors to acquire <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assets The government reported that new single-family homes sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 679,000 last month, the fastest pace since new homes sold at a rate of 728,000 in April 1987. It was the third consecutive increase, coming atop a 1.2 percent rise in March and an 11.4 percent jump in February.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Futures Open Lower, Turn Mixed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Most grain and soybean futures opened slightly lower today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, then turned mixed in early trading. Analysts said the opening losses were due to profit-taking after Tuesday's sharp gains, which saw contracts for future delivery of soybeans, soybean meal, corn and oats all advance the limit allowed for daily trading. Dry planting conditions last month and fears of a summer drought in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> are behind the dramatic increase in grain and soybean futures prices this year. The weather outlook for the remainder of the week offered some straws of hope for farmers, analysts said. `` Some light rains are expected Thursday and Friday but they sure do n't look like anything substantial,'' said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybean planting was about 74 percent complete as of Sunday. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> reported the corn crop in good to fair condition and noted some deterioration in the condition of the maturing winter wheat crop. In early trading, wheat was 3 -LCB- cents to 4 cents lower with the contract for delivery in July at $ 3.48 a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 2 cents lower with July at $ 2.22 -RCB- a bushel; oats were \ cent lower to 1 -LCB- cents higher with July at $ 1.83 -RCB- a bushel; soybeans were -LCB- cent to 4 cents higher with July at $ 8.02 a bushel.

Live cattle settled .05 cent lower to .17 cent higher with June at 72.32 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .30 cent higher with August at 76.57 cents a pound; hogs were .17 cent lower to .20 cent higher with June at 54.60 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .30 cent lower to .58 cent higher with July at 56.90 cents a pound.

 The government said today its chief forecasting gauge of economic activity rose a moderate 0.2 percent in April in what amounted to a signal of steady economic growth with no danger of a recession this year. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said its Index of Leading Indicators rose for the third consecutive month, following a revised 0.2 percent March increase and a 1.5 percent February surge, the biggest gain in more than two years. Economists said the performance of the leading index was entirely consistent with their belief that the economy was headed for its best year since 1984 as smokestack <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> benefits from a boom in export sales. `` The rise in the leading indicators indicates the economy is experiencing continuous expansion based primarily on improving trade and greater capital investment,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jasinowski </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION>. In other good economic news, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said that orders to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories rose a strong 1.2 percent in April following a 1.6 percent March increase. The department also reported today that construction spending edged up 0.1 percent in April as a big jump in investment on new factories offset a decline in spending on government projects. All of this should be good news to Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who hopes to benefit from a feeling among voters that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is managing the economy well. The March increase had originally been reported as a much larger 0.8 percent rise. Analysts had expected both the big downward revision to the March figure and the small increase in April. They said the gains reflected a return to more normal economic activity following a roller-coaster period after the October stock market crash. At one point, the leading index actually fell for three consecutive months, the traditional signal of an impending recession. Later revisions, however, showed the index posted big declines in both November and January, but registered increases in other months. Fears of a recession this year have largely evaporated as the economy shook off the jolt from the market collapse to turn in surprisingly strong growth for this advanced stage of a five-year-old economic recovery. The government reported last week that the overall economy, as measured by the gross national product, raced ahead at an annual rate of 3.9 percent for the first three months of the year. Based on this GNP performance, many economists are now predicting the GNP will grow at an annual rate of around 3.5 percent for the whole year, which would be the fastest expansion pace since 1984, also a presidential election year, when the GNP rose 6.8 percent. The 0.2 percent April rise in the leading index reflected increases in five separate business indicators and declines in four others. The biggest source of strength was a rise in the length of the average workweek. Other sources of strength came from gains in the money supply; a drop in weekly unemployment claims; a rise in raw materials prices, which is seen as a positive sign for future economic growth; and an increase in plant and equipment orders. The biggest negative factor was a speed-up in delivery times for business orders, seen as a sign of weaker demand. This was followed by a decline in stock prices, a drop in building permits and a drop in orders for consumer goods. The various changes left the index at 192.2 percent of its 1967 base of 100. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, head of a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> consulting firm, said he has boosted his GNP forecast to 3.7 percent for 1988, a far cry from the recession he had expected in the wake of the stock market collapse. `` A lot of people used to think the stock market was one of the better indicators of the economy's performance, but it fell on its face this time,'' he said. The administration's official forecast is for GNP growth of 2.9 percent this year, but <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON>, the president's chief economic adviser, said recently that the administration may boost that assessment when it issues its midterm economic review in August. While the economic strength has caused economists to put away their recession scenarios for 1988, many analysts still believe that a downturn is likely sometime in 1989. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economists </ORGANIZATION> said last week that its latest member survey found that 57 percent were looking for a recession to begin in 1989. This pessimistic view is based on a belief that the economic strength this year will ignite inflationary pressures, leading in turn to higher interest rates that could topple the country into a recession. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> already has tightened credit twice in the past two months in an effort to dampen demand. But <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Penzer </PERSON>, senior economist at <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, said that was too pessimistic an outlook. `` The key is whether the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> can gradually tighten and slow the economy down without sending it into a recession,'' he said. `` They are walking a tightrope, but they may be successful in their attempt at fine tuning.''

Spokeswoman <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Musto </PERSON> said people laid off earlier may be recalled to fill in during the summer season. The Machinists, representing 12,000 mechanics and other ground workers, have resisted management calls for sharp cuts in the salaries of non-mechanics. A federal mediator, who's had the dispute since January, set two weeks of intense talks beginning Tuesday. Eastern President <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakes </PERSON> last year said the company needed to cut labor costs by some 30 percent overall.

 The stock market ran up a broad gain today, following through on Tuesday's strong rally. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 74.68 points Tuesday for its second biggest advance this year, rose 9.42 to 2,040.54 by noontime today on Wall Street. Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 2 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 962 up, 393 down and 448 unchanged. Interest rates fell for the second straight day in the credit markets, reducing yields on long-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds to just above the 9.2 percent level. Analysts said revived enthusiasm for both stocks and bonds was prompted in part by talk that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> was eager to avoid raising its discount rate, despite its other moves of late to tighten credit.

<TEXT>
 At the Energy Pool bar in the heart of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s business district, office workers worn out by the daily grind are seeking a solution at the bottom of a bottle _ a tonic bottle A fixture at drugstores and kiosks in commuter stations, tonics are the kick that refreshes the hard-working Japanese, famous for toiling long hours and shunning paid holidays. Taking a tonic here is not like popping open a cola for breakfast or sneaking a nip at lunch in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It's more akin to taking your vitamins But it's in fashion. And besides, some of the tonics are laced with alcohol, caffeine or nicotine derivatives _ which makes them a whole lot easier to swallow. Whether the drinks are regarded as soft, hard, or somewhere in between, depends on the kind of punch they pack. Some do contain vitamins, but none is seriously regarded as an antidote for what ails you _ despite their advertising claims. And many contain enough stimulants to worry doctors that the drinks could become mildly addictive. So how do they taste? Well, they vary. Popular now are some resembling non-sweetened cough syrup, or as one Westerner described them, Dr. Pepper without the fizz. While the content of the drinks is regulated by the government, few restrictions have been placed on their sale. The strongest tonics are mostly sold in drugstores; drinks containing alcohol are required to say so on their labels. The Energy Pool bar offers over 180 varieties, ranging in price from 100 yen -LRB- 80 cents -RRB- to 3,000 yen -LRB- $ 24 -RRB- and containing such exotic ingredients as cobra extract or essence of seal. Industry sources estimate the market nationwide has swelled to nearly $ 1 billion, an increase of 13 percent from 1986. Over half that figure came from sales of tonics in tiny bottles of 50 milliliters -LRB- 1.5 fluid ounces -RRB- or less, according to <PERSON> Takanori </PERSON> <PERSON> Fujimoto </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Takeda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest drug maker. Alinamin V, a vitamin B1 tonic introduced by <ORGANIZATION> Takeda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> in March 1987, sold 10 million bottles its first year, <PERSON> Fujimoto </PERSON> said. `` The response was much greater than we expected.'' In developing Alinamin V, <PERSON> Takeda </PERSON> sought to imitate the success of Coca Cola, originally a tonic derived from coca leaves, which revolutionized the beverage industry worldwide. Tonic names often suggest medicinal qualities, while catchy advertising phrases make the drinks out to be something fit for a samurai warrior going into battle. `` Can you fight for 24 hours?'' asks a commercial for Regain, a drink introduced in April. Many workers may be asking themselves the same question. In <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, where workers averaged 2,150 work hours for 1986 _ compared with 1,924 in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and 1,655 in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> _ six-day work weeks are common. Over 80 percent of 400 <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> businessmen polled by the <ORGANIZATION> Fukoku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in February were found to suffer work-related fatigue. Though most said they battled the blahs with sleep, baths or alcohol, vitamin and tonic drinks were mentioned by over 25 percent _ more than exercise, a healthy diet and sick leave combined. Why tonics? <ORGANIZATION> Takeda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Fujimoto </PERSON> said the current boom in tonic sales reflects a break with the past. `` People now buy the drinks before they get tired, as a kind of preventative action,'' <PERSON> Fujimoto </PERSON> said. And, though men over the age of 50 have traditionally made up the bulk of the market, `` Sales are way up among young office workers, particularly women.'' <PERSON> Miyako </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakanishi </PERSON>, pharmacist and manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pool </ORGANIZATION>, said tonics claim to cure or alleviate a long list of white-collar woes _ stomachaches and poor appetite caused by stress, minor colds brought on by lack of exercise, or hangovers from bouts of work-related socializing. But, according to Ms. <PERSON> Nakanishi </PERSON>, the immediate boost from tonics is what brings in the customers. `` Most of our customers are after instant energy,'' she said. As sales grow, however, so do concerns that the drinks may not be as healthy as their makers claim. <PERSON> Takashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Higuchi </PERSON>, a physiologist at <ORGANIZATION> Fukui </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, said the tonics may be good for their vitamin content, but he would n't recommend them highly to sufferers of fatigue or anything else. Ms. <PERSON> Nakanishi </PERSON> admitted the drinks may be habit-forming, but added, `` They're safe, if consumption is limited to one bottle a day. Recently some customers have asked specifically for drinks that do n't contain alcohol or caffeine, but most are n't concerned with long-term effects.'' After all, most tonic drinkers are lured by the mystique, not the ingredients. `` Businessmen work long hours; they're tired,'' said <PERSON> Hisako </PERSON> <PERSON> Yoshizawa </PERSON>, a commentator often quoted by Japanese media. `` Often they do n't eat breakfast and they do n't care, really, what the drinks contain.''

<HEAD>Toyota Executive Says Decision On U.S. Firm Is Near</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> will decide soon whether to build a truck plant in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, a move that would halt Japanese truck exports to the American market, a <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> executive said. Negotiations have `` progressed to a rather considerable extent'' and a decision is expected soon, <PERSON> Tsutomu </PERSON> <PERSON> Oshima </PERSON>, executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION>, said in an interview in today's <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Times. Such a move would result in the end of <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION>'s truck exports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, he said. Although he refused to disclose the export value of Toyota trucks, he said the company sent 280,000 pickup trucks to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year, with an average retail value of $ 9,000. Sites under consideration for the plant, <PERSON> Oshima </PERSON> said, include <LOCATION> Fremont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> operates a joint venture producing passenger cars with <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> just opened an independent passenger car production plant; or a new location. Start-up costs could eliminate the possiblity of a new location, <PERSON> Oshima </PERSON> said. `` Before the yen started appreciating in value, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> developed the -LRB- small -RRB- pickup market in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Even with a 25 percent tariff, we could sell our trucks at inexpensive prices,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> has been forced to raise its retail truck prices an average of 26.7 percent since 1985 and the prices `` have become a burden on the user,'' <PERSON> Oshima </PERSON> said. American sales of Toyota trucks totaled about 250,000 in 1987, down 30,000 from 1986. This year, sales have continued to decline, <PERSON> Oshima </PERSON> said.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Stock prices jumped Wednesday as the market was supported by gains on overseas equity markets. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index finished 21.3 points, or 1.2 percent, higher at 1,805.7. Volume was a moderate 440.3 million shares, compared with 367.8 million Tuesday. The Dow Jones industrial average was 11.02 points higher at 2,042.14 when the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> session drew to a close. Dealers said Wall Street's buoyant activity Tuesday, when the Dow Jones average jumped 74.68 points, continued to support <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> stocks. `` There is n't much of a story to the market,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Larkham </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, adding that the gains in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> were `` entirely Wall Street's influence.'' `` If Wall Street has a super bounce, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> is n't about to ignore it,'' <PERSON> Larkham </PERSON> said, explaining that `` it's even a bit disappointing that the market has n't gone higher. Advances in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> earlier Wednesday also motivated the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> market, analysts said. Market watchers said they were anxious to see if the 100-stock index would remain above the critical 1,800-point barrier over the next few sessions. If so, a new direction might be established for the market, several analysts said.

<HEAD>OECD Forecasts Interest Rate Rise for U.S.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Interest rates could rise further in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the coming months, and there is little likelihood of any easing of rates in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> is the only member of the `` Group of Seven'' industrialized countries where the cost of credit is expected to decline, the <ORGANIZATION> OECD </ORGANIZATION> said in the latest issue of its publication Financial Market Trends. The interest rate outlook for <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is less clear because it depends on how the government allows the pound to move in relation to other currencies, the report said. The <ORGANIZATION> OECD </ORGANIZATION>'s observation on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rates was made before the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> tightened credit last week by pressuring up the overnight rate charged among banks for overnight loans to meet reserve requirements. The <ORGANIZATION> OECD </ORGANIZATION> said it based its forecast for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rates on concerns about a pickup of inflationary pressures, strong credit demand and the country's large trade deficit. Total credit demand in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is expected to strengthen over the coming months as the economy's expansion continues, chiefly due to an anticipated steep rise in corporate borrowing, the <ORGANIZATION> OECD </ORGANIZATION> said. Turning to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, the organization observed that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s trade gap widened sharply in the first quarter While stemming the deficit `` would perhaps require bringing the pound to a more competitive level, implying lower interest rates,'' such a move would clash with the government's anti-inflation policy, the report said. The <ORGANIZATION> OECD </ORGANIZATION> predicted all major segments of Japanese financial markets would remain very active in the coming months, suggesting that the growing financing needs of the economy `` should be met without any particular strain on current credit conditions.'' `` The scope for lower rates remains limited,'' because <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s money supply is already expanding at an unprecedented rate, and its possible inflationary implications are giving rise to concern, the report said West German interest rates are also unlikely to come down further because of the strength of overall loan demand and growth in the money supply that is running ahead of the target rate, the <ORGANIZATION> OECD </ORGANIZATION> said.

 A federal judge set for June 20 a proxy vote to decide who will control consumer products maker <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. District Judge <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> on Tuesday set the date for the company's annual meeting, at which shareholders will choose between slates of directors put forth by management and dissident shareholders The fight to gain control of <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> is being waged by two <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment houses that are heavily invested in AI's preferred stock. The investment houses, <ORGANIZATION> Spear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leeds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Kellogg </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Bomar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION>, say the company's managers are trying to entrench themselves while ignoring shareholder interests.

Management says <ORGANIZATION> Spear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leeds </ORGANIZATION> can not be trusted to run <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> and that its candidates have no experience in running a consumer products company. A judge supervising AI's bankruptcy delayed the May 20 proxy vote. <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> overruled the bankruptcy judge, but an appeals judge delayed the meeting again until the full appeals court could consider the matter. Ruling on a narrow legal issue, the appeals court last week refused to further delay the meeting, but left room open for further arguments. Unsecured creditors wanted to halt the proxy vote, claiming a change of management would delay the company's emergence from bankruptcy while the campaign would drain money from the financially ailing company.

 Grain futures closed lower Wednesday amid steady profit-taking on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Oil prices edged higher in listless trading Wednesday as traders mostly stayed on the sidelines, awaiting the upcoming ministerial meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Contracts for July delivery of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate, the benchmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, closed up 7 cents at $ 17.58 per 42-gallon barrel on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Among July contracts for refined products, wholesale unleaded gasoline rose 0.28 cent to 51.74 cents a gallon, while wholesale heating oil rose 0.13 cent a gallon to 47.31 cents. `` It was another one of those dull, dull days,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON>, assistant director of the energy group at <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. He said the market showed no reaction to reports that the start of <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s regular summer meeting had been postponed by three days _ to June 11 _ because of an apparent scheduling conflict with another event. Traders have been reluctant to commit themselves in the market until they get some idea of how the meeting turns out, <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON> added. Representatives of the cartel's 13 members are expected to make another attempt at negotiating a package of production cutbacks in order to support prices.

<HEAD>Boston Edison Launches Energy Cooperative That Relies on Peer

<TEXT>
 A kind of socialism is being tried by a group of <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s biggest commercial customers that have agreed to cooperate with each other to ease energy consumption. Under a year-long trial that began Wednesday, 10 <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> customers will work together to decide which should forfeit some electrical power during peak demand periods. They might do this by, for example, shutting off a bank of elevators or turning off the hot water for a few hours. As a result the utility estimates it could save 10 megawatts, or enough to meet a year's electrical needs in 5,000 homes. <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> has 640,000 residential and business customers in 40 cities and towns within a 30-mile radius of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. In addition to cutting back their electricity bill, the members of the <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION>, as the group is called, will be paid as if they are electricity providers. That's not new, however. What is different is that the arrangement combines peer pressure and altruism to save money and energy. To reinforce the cooperative spirit, each member of the group will be `` graded'' by the other members. If successful, the experiment will generate long-term contracts and more companies will be invited to join the cooperative. The cooperative will be headed for its first year by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, a former engineer who heads the non-profit <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, which runs eight such utility cooperatives. `` The era of building -LRB- power -RRB- plants is over and the time for better utilization of resources is here,'' he said at a news conference explaining the cooperative plan, which he said also is being used on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. A self-described arch-conservative, <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said in an interview later that he has explained the dea to visiting planners from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. He said they all found the notion novel. `` What we have here is ... a democratic society in a more socialist environment,'' he said. `` You ca n't force people to do things.'' <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Reznicek </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION>, said the experiment is an attempt to deal with changes in demand for power. `` We have been an industry in a supply side mentality. That strategy has been a high-cost strategy,'' he said. `` Intelligent people stop and take a look and say there has to be a better way.''

<HEAD>Fina Hopes To Fuel Distributors' Initiative</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Fina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has unveiled an incentive plan in its 22-state gasoline distribution network that will give independent distributors as much as $ 35,000 annually in retirement benefits. Under the plan, which analysts say is unprecedented in the industry, distributors who buy at least 2 million gallons of fuel annually can receive retirement benefits of $ 10,000 per year. Those who purchase 30 million gallons per year or more can be eligible to receive up to $ 35,000 per year in benefits. The benefits accrue to the owners of the <ORGANIZATION> Fina </ORGANIZATION> distributorships or to the employees they designate, officials said Tuesday. `` This will motivate our jobbers to do a better job for themselves as well as for <ORGANIZATION> Fina </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Fina </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president of marketing and developer of the plan. Analysts said the move also will help the company polish the outdated image of some locations and upgrade a retail network that includes gas stations in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>. `` I think it benefits the company and the dealers,'' <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Sudol </PERSON>, investment analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Fitch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>. She called the retirement plan an imaginative `` carrot-and-stick approach'' that will require distributors to improve the quality of their stations to take advantage of the retirement program. The retirement program, which began Wednesday and runs through May 1993, is provided at no cost to the distributors, although they must meet certain company-imposed requirements. <ORGANIZATION> Fina </ORGANIZATION>, a unit of Dallas-based <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petrofina </ORGANIZATION>, has about 4,000 service stations nationwide. To be eligible, distributors must buy at least 2 million gallons of gasoline or other refined products annually from the parent company and reinvest available building funds in accordance with <ORGANIZATION> Fina </ORGANIZATION>'s ongoing building program. Retirement fund participants also are required to increase their fuel purchases by at least 5 percent through May 31, 1989. Similar annual requirements must be met for distributors to continue in the program until its expiration on May 31, 1993. All of <ORGANIZATION> Fina </ORGANIZATION>'s 460 distributors who own or operate about 3,850 stations in 22 states are eligible for the program, <PERSON> Pearman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Pearman </PERSON> said the program is being financed through several insurance companies and other lenders and that <ORGANIZATION> Fina </ORGANIZATION> may decide to continue the program after the initial five-year period. The retirement benefits are guaranteed for the qualified participant for life and are payable starting June 1, 1998, but not before the participant reaches 65.

 The stock market swept ahead for the second straight session today in buying inspired by waning fears about rising interest rates and inflation. Interest rates fell for the second straight day in the credit markets, reducing yields on long-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds to the 9.1 percent to 9.2 percent level. Analysts said revived enthusiasm for both stocks and bonds was prompted in part by talk that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> was eager to avoid raising its discount rate, despite its other moves of late to tighten credit. Aside from that rationale, many Wall Streeters openly expressed surprise at the market's sudden show of strength on Tuesday. Unexpected as it was, the rally raised hopes that stocks had pulled out of the slump they been suffering through for the past several weeks. The government's report that the index of leading economic indicators rose 0.2 percent in April was in line with expectations, and brokers said it had little discernible effect on the market.

<TEXT>
 If you've been hearing for weeks about the post-crash stock market's malaise, you're probably wondering what has sent prices surging higher so suddenly. Welcome to the crowd. Seasoned market watchers expressed surprise at the buying spree following the long Memorial Day weekend that sent the languishing <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average up more than 100 points in two days. It soared nearly 75 points Tuesday, the biggest one-day rise since the beginning of the year, and tacked on 33 more on Wednesday. Many analysts said the rally once again proved the adage that you can not outguess the market. But some veteran economists warned that they saw no development that should so radically improve Wall Street's gloomy outlook for inflation and higher interest rates. Evidence of rising inflation persists, from the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> commodity pits to the neighborhood grocery checkout. Strains on <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s productive abilities, coupled with fears of a profound farm drought this summer, are intensifying upward pressure on prices. `` There's only one way to start writing this story: ` Once upon a time ...,''' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON>, chief economist of <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. International in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said in response to the stock market's abrupt `` It's a bit of a fairy tale out there.'' Explanations for the turnaround included speculation that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> will not tighten credit further, a realization that the economy is healthy, and a post-holiday tendency to buy stocks. Some economists said the market's reversal confirmed their view that inflation is not a big problem. A few even suggested President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s performance at the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit injected a euphoric mood into the market that has n't been seen since last summer, well before the stunning collapse of Oct. 19 But others said they simply did not know why the market had reversed course. `` It's a very good question,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stovall </PERSON>, a New York-based stock market forecaster. `` The serenity could be short-lived. Everything that's happened has been given a positive bias or ignored.'' Some economists who scrutinize the links between markets were disturbed by Wall Street's big gain, partly because it defied a logical pattern that had developed between stocks, bonds and commodity prices. In that relationship, when commodity prices rise, bonds fall over the consequent fear of inflation and depress stocks as well. But on Tuesday, commodity prices jumped _ while stocks and bonds also rose. `` On balance, what's going on with the stock and bond markets does not ring true,'' <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON> said. `` The trap door is going to open up again and suck everybody down.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Moran </PERSON>, chief economist at <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, speculated the Wall Street rally reflected growing investor hopes of no further moves to tighten credit by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>. He said rising commodity prices were based on fear of drought, not a broad inflationary move. `` In that environment, inflation fears subside and the market can do a bit better,'' <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> already has moved a few times this year to nudge interest rates higher through its control of the amount of money in the banking system. There had been speculation last week that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> would take a more drastic step by announcing an increase in the discount rate, the loan fee it charges financial institutions. The rate has remained at 6 percent since Sept. 4. Some market watchers said it was pointless to speculate about the short-term ups and downs of stock prices because meaningful trends can only be detected over a long period. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sobel </PERSON>, a Wall Street historian and professor who has written several books on the market, said he would advise investors to ignore most economists' predictions of stock behavior because they are so unreliable. `` They'd be better off using <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s astrologist,'' <PERSON> Sobel </PERSON> said. `` I think these people are vastly overpaid. They do n't know what they're doing most of the time.''

 A West German fugitive accused of defrauding <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> of more than $ 280 million will be escorted home Friday by federal German police, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities said Wednesday. <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Joachim </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>, 38, a former currency trader from <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, has exhausted his extradition appeals, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney's Office. In the warrant for <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>'s arrest and the extradition request, he is charged with forgery of documents and instigation of embezzlement in a scheme in which employees of <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagenwerk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION> were persuaded to enter into foreign currency transactions as part of a secret profit-sharing agreement. <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> was arrested on a fugitive warrant in November 1987 at his <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> apartment, where he was living under an assumed name. A special team of West German federal police was created a year ago to hunt for <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>, who fled in March 1987 after the discovery of alleged fraudulent foreign exchange deals that cost <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> about $ 282.4 million. <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> said it first discovered the fraud when the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hungary </ORGANIZATION> refused to honor a contract calling on it to buy dollars from <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION>.

 One of the largest investors in the <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> nuclear power plant decided Wednesday to start withdrawing from the troubled project by stopping payments. `` Our many successes have been hidden by the shadow of <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, general manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wholesale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, after the vote by the eight directors. `` This is not a bailout of <ORGANIZATION> MMWEC </ORGANIZATION> or of individual towns,'' he said. `` It will enable <ORGANIZATION> MMWEC </ORGANIZATION> to get on with its business.'' The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> utility supplies power to 34 municipal electric departments across the state. Its shares in <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> were bought on behalf of 28 systems in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and eight in other Northeastern states, and the investors together owned an 11.6 percent share of <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION>.

 Construction on a $ 31 million expansion project at <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> is expected to get under way in July, company officials said The expansions are to provide for assembly of Sentra engines and rear truck axles and production of plastic parts for bumpers, according to a report published Wednesday in the <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> Banner. The project is not expected to create many new jobs, <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> officials said. `` The major part of the engine assembly will be in existing space in the plant. Adjacent to that, we're adding 7,500 square feet,'' said <PERSON> Emil </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> vice president and director of plant and process engineering. Once the engine assembly line is complete next spring, plans call for the line to start piecing together engines at a rate of about 145,000 a year after a short break-in phase, he said. Initial production, testing and `` de-bugging'' of the assembly line should take place about May 1989. Later plans call for adding a second passenger car line, which would increase the plant's capacity from 265,000 vehicles per year to 400,000. That expansion will require a larger work force, officials said. Engines for Sentras are currently made by <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>; axles in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>; and the bumper parts by <ORGANIZATION> Decoma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plastics </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Magna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> decided Wednesday to give securities industry officials a month to press their objections to a proposal aimed at protecting investors' option to sue their brokers The commission had been scheduled to vote to ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to pass a law barring brokerage firms from requiring customers to agree in advance to submit disputes to stock exchange-sponsored arbitration panels. But the vote was postponed after commissioners <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleischman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Grundfest </PERSON> said the matter required more deliberation. Commissioners agreed to decide the matter during the first week of July, before one of the advocates of the change, <PERSON> Aulana </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON>, leaves the commission. <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> argued it was unfair to require investors to give up the right to sue before they have any idea of the nature or size of a dispute that may later arise. <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> also said that providing an alternative to arbitration will serve as an incentive to keeping the system fair. <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> said he was inclined to support <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> but wanted to give the brokerage firms a chance to argue their case. A survey by the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> staff of 65 firms, handling 90 percent of all customer accounts, showed that virtually all require customers to arbitrate disputes, particularly customers who borrow money through margin accounts or trade in stock options. The <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administrators </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a group of state regulators, has been pressing to do away with mandatory arbitration clauses.

 Silver futures prices soared to 4 -LCB- - month highs Wednesday after a Peruvian silver mine indicated it may not able to meet its delivery schedule because of a miners' strike On other markets, other precious metals advanced; frozen pork bellies posted limit gains for the second consecutive day while livestock futures were mixed; sugar, bond and stock-index futures rose sharply; grains and soybeans were mostly lower; and energy futures were mixed. The <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>'s index of 21 commodities rose 1.46 points to 249.85 as 10 components gained, seven declined and four ended mixed. Late Tuesday, one of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s larger silver mines said it could not be held responsible for failure to fulfill its contractual obligations for silver delivery because of a strike. The news gave the silver market the push it needed to overcome technical resistance and begin catching up with the surging platinumn market, analysts said. `` I think the market was primed for any kind of even mildly bullish fundamental news and they got it last night,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s precious metals and foreign exchange group. <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> is a major silver-producing country but the effective shutdown of a single mine hardly qualifies as a major disruption in the pipeline, <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> said. Rather, he said, Wednesday's announcement `` instigated a long-overdue rally so silver could catch up with platinum,'' which has risen in recent weeks to its highest price since October. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, silver settled 21.3 to 21.8 cents higher with the contract for delivery in July at $ 6.865 a troy ounce; gold was $ 1.80 to $ 2.60 higher with August at $ 462.40 a troy ounce. Platinum futures on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> settled $ 4.20 to $ 13 higher with July at $ 622.90 a troy ounce. Pork belly futures posted strong gains on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> for the second day in a row due to technical factors and expectations of a continuing seasonal decline in hog slaughters, analysts said. `` Basically, the game in the bellies today was the fact they could n't press -LRB- prices -RRB- lower,'' said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Durchholz </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> AgriVisor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> `` Then the fresh bellies took a nice pop, $ 1 to $ 2 -LRB- per hundredweight -RRB-, and that really fueled the strength in the belly pits late in the day.'' The contract for March delivery gained 2 cents a pound, the limit allowed for daily trading. Hog and cattle futures finished mixed. Live cattle settled .22 cent lower to .08 cent higher with June at 72.20 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .13 cent to .07 cent higher with August at 76.22 cents a pound; hogs were .27 cent lower to .20 cent higher with June at 54.50 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .78 cent to 2 cents higher with July at 57.60 cents a pound. World sugar futures rallied sharply on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on reports of a large swap-type purchase by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and indications the Soviets were seeking more, analysts said. Sugar for July delivery settled .49 cent higher at 9.96 cents a pound. Interest-rate futures surged on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, indicating expectations of smaller yields on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Treasury bonds. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Sturm </PERSON>, senior economist with Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Kleinwort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the rally could mean that fears of higher interest rates have peaked. The contract for June delivery of the 20-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond settled 1 23-32 points higher at 87 17-32. Stock-index futures posted sharp gains on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for June delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled 3.90 points higher at 266.85. Grain futures settled lower amid steady profit-taking on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Soybeans finished mixed. Traders who had bought into Tuesday's limit gains turned sellers as meteorologists predicted scattered light rain in the Grain Belt over the next few days, analysts said. The bullish interest in near-month soybean contracts remained strong. The price for July delivery of soybeans surpassed $ 8 a bushel, the highest price for a nearby soybean contract in more than four years. Wheat settled 2 -RCB- cents to 7 cents lower with July at $ 3.47 -RCB- a bushel; corn was 2 -LCB- cents to 4 -RCB- cents lower with July at $ 2.20 -RCB- a bushel; oats were 2 -RCB- cents to 3 \ cents lower with July at $ 1.79 \ a bushel; soybeans were 7 -LCB- cents lower to 3 -RCB- cents higher with July at $ 8.01 -RCB- a Energy futures finished mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in listless trading ahead of an upcoming meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled .11 cent lower to .07 cent higher with July at $ 17.58 a barrel; heating oil was .06 cent to .19 cent lower to .28 cent higher with July at 51.74 cents a gallon.

 <ORGANIZATION> Combustion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> announced in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Wednesday that it had reached an agreement to help build and manage a multibillion-dollar petrochemical complex in two Western Siberian cities. This is the Stamford-based company's second deal with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in the last six months. In November, the company announced the first Soviet-American joint venture established under the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s new policy allowing Western concerns to own a share of Soviet industries. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugel </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Combustion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION>, said engineering and site preparation in the cities of <LOCATION> Tobolsk </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Surgut </ORGANIZATION> probably would begin later this year. `` These two complexes will probably be the largest created in the world,'' <PERSON> Hugel </PERSON> said. Analysts applauded Wednesday's announcement. `` I'm pleased, but it is too early to tell what the full impact will be on Combustion Engineering's financial statements,'' said <PERSON> Candice </PERSON> <PERSON> Eggerss </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` I think it has the potential for being a very big market, but because of the lack of a track record -LRB- in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> joint ventures -RRB-, it's hard to know now. `` They've put a very small amount of capital at risk for large potential rewards in the future,'' she added. The plants will produce synthetic rubber and plastics for consumer goods, he said. The Western <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> site was chosen because of its abundance of natural gas, he said. <PERSON> Hugel </PERSON> said he met with Soviet Premier <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> last week about the project, and `` Mr. <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> would like to see the first plant completed by the end of 1991 or early 1992, and all of it done by 1995. That's a very ambitious schedule but it's the schedule we are committed to.'' <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON>'s involvement in the project reflected the attention that high-level officials are giving to improving the supply of consumer goods as part of Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s effort to restructure the Soviet economy <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has promised that his reforms will lead to an improvement in supplies of goods and services to consumers who struggle with a system of shortages and shoddy quality. `` There appears to be unusual urgency to get this project under way,'' <PERSON> Hugel </PERSON> said. `` In the last several months it obviously has become much more important, and the need to get on with it has been made clear by Soviet officials.'' <PERSON> Hugel </PERSON> said the project is worth `` many billions of dollars,'' but he could not give exact figure. He said its much bigger than a joint venture to build a pair of plastics factories in the Soviet <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> announced April 13 by <ORGANIZATION> Occidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> estimated the value of its project at $ 200 million Combustion Engineering will lead a consortium that also will include <ORGANIZATION> McDermott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, the Japanese firms <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mitsui </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> USSR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petrochemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Tobolsk </LOCATION> is located about 1,100 miles east of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Surgut is located about 270 miles to the northeast of <LOCATION> Tobolsk </LOCATION>. The Western companies will receive payments in convertible currency for their design, engineering, and construction work, and then will be invited to participate in a joint venture that actually will manufacture the petrochemicals, <PERSON> Hugel </PERSON> said. The Soviet ruble is not convertible, making it difficult for foreign companies to export profits. But the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> earns much of its hard currency through sales of oil and natural gas and certain ministries recently have been given the right to use hard currency as an incentive to attract foreign companies into joint ventures. The plastics will be made both for Soviet domestic use and for export. Officials said the percentage to be exported has not been determined, but that most of the plastics may go to the domestic market if <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s effort to stimulate consumer products is successful. Combustion Engineering provides equipment and services for the power and process industries, such as paper mills and oil refineries. The company reported sales in 1987 of about $ 3 billion.

 A post-holiday rally in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> financial markets sustained the dollar's strength in foreign exchange Wednesday despite a slight dip in early Japanese trading. Gold prices also continued to climb. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> said gold bullion was bid at $ 457.50 a troy ounce at 4 p.m. EDT, up from $ 454.30 late Tuesday. The price has moved up $ 6.50 over the past two days. Currency traders said the dollar was benefiting from the surprising rush of bullishness that has infected the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> stock and bond markets since investors returned from the long Memorial Day weekend. Stocks and bonds moved up strongly again Wednesday for the second consecutive day. Traders said investors appeared sanguine about the level of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates and the pace of economic growth and were jumping into equities and bonds to snap up bargains. The strength of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency mirrored the investors' new-found confidence in the American markets. `` The sentiment has been so bearish for the dollar, most money has been on the sidelines,'' observed <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Holzer </PERSON>, chief dealer for <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` I think we're seeing the first realization of fresh money moving back into the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>'' <PERSON> Holzer </PERSON> said currency traders were restructuring their positions in light of the sudden shift of capital into American stocks and bonds. But he cautioned, `` The longevity of this thing is uncertain.'' The dollar weakened during morning trading in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where the business day begins, after <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> governor <PERSON> Satoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sumita </PERSON> told reporters he thought a long-term rise in the dollar unlikely. But the dollar soon recovered, closing in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> at 125.23 Japanese yen, up from 124.80 yen on Tuesday. In later trading, the dollar traded at 125.25 yen in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and 125.425 yen in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with 125.235 late Tuesday. The British pound continued to weaken against the dollar and West German mark. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it cost $ 1.8220 to buy one pound, compared with $ 1.8385 late Tuesday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the pound fetched $ 1.81335, compared with $ 1.8353 late Tuesday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Tuesday's rates, included: 1.7308 West German marks, down from 1.73265; 1.44345 Swiss francs, down from 1.44525; 1.23035 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2333; 5.8425 French francs, up from 5.8300; and 1,286.62 Italian lire, up from 1,284.00. Late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Tuesday's prices, included: 1.7255 West German marks, down from 1.7292; 1.4390 Swiss francs, down from 1.4437; 5.8270 French francs, up from 5.8215; 1.9330 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9333; 1,282.50 Italian lire, up from 1,279.95; and 1.2319 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2357 Gold, still riding the coattails of the recent strong move in platinum, rose in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 456.50 a troy ounce, compared with late Tuesday's $ 454.80. Gold was higher in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION> as well, closing at a bid $ 457, compared with $ 455 late Tuesday. Earlier, the metal closed in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> at a bid $ 458.55, up from $ 455.80. At the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, gold bullion for current delivery was quoted at $ 457.60 a troy ounce, up from $ 455 a troy ounce late Tuesday. Silver bullion prices rose on the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> market where the metal was trading at a late bid price of $ 6.79 a troy ounce, compared with Tuesday's $ 6.65. On the Comex, silver bullion for current delivery was quoted at $ 6.818 a troy ounce, up from $ 6.600 late Tuesday. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Precious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said that while the metals rally reflected some lingering inflation fears in the commodities markets, it also was a sign of relief among investors who had been expecting further interest rates hikes by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>.

 Having taken his potshots at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, former <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> is now zinging <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the giant investment firm he headed during its rapid growth in the 1970s. In the June 20 issue of Fortune magazine, <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> blasts the current management at <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> and suggests the company be taken over. `` How long does it take to get your act together?'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> asked. `` You guys have had over three years.'' The three-year period refers to <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schreyer </PERSON>'s tenure as chief executive of the firm. <PERSON> Schreyer </PERSON> added the job of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> chairman to that of chief executive in June 1984, succeeding <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Birk </PERSON>, who had followed <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> in the top job. <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it was surprised and disappointed by some of the statements attributed to <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>. `` Perhaps they reflect the fact that -LRB- <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> has -RRB- been away from business for eight years _ a period marked by dramatic and complex changes,'' <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Yager </PERSON> said. `` We believe <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> is well positioned for the near - and long-term future. <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> quit <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> to take the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> post in 1980 and became White House chief of staff in 1985. He left the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration last year and recently published a book highly critical of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>. Now head of <ORGANIZATION> Regdon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, an investment firm based in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> asserts in the Fortune article that <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>'s costs went out of control under <PERSON> Birk </PERSON>. `` Some of the people under <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> got a little too headstrong and a little fat and lazy,'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> was not exactly run in a spartan manner. Eventually costs became a problem. They -LRB- maagement -RRB- got too used to limousines and perks.'' As for <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>'s direction under <PERSON> Schreyer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> takes issue with management's approach of investing for the long term. `` You do n't have the luxury of the long term,'' he said. `` It's a cold, cruel world out there After all, would <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> recommend to its customers that they buy the securities of a company whose business is n't improving?'' As with its Wall Street competitors, <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> has been buffeted by heightened competition in financial services and the aftermath of the stock market crash. Its first quarter profit of $ 68.3 million was off 37 percent from a year earlier, while its 1987 earnings of $ 390.6 million dropped 14 percent from 1986. <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> argued that <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> should be taken over by a commercial bank or some other big financial services company to cope if deregulation ever allows banks to compete in the brokerage business. `` It would give the firm a hell of a competitive edge in servicing the full range of corporations' financial needs,'' he asserted. `` Merrill is not smart enough to start lending money de novo.'' <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> cited <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guaranty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acceptance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the automaker's financial arm, as prospective buyers. `` Our strategy has been to build our capital base from within through steady growth and selected acquisitions, and that remains our strategy,'' <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Yager </PERSON> said.

 A woman who died of lung cancer after smoking for 40 years knew the risks but chose to smoke anyway, a tobacco company lawyer said Wednesday as final arguments began in the product liability trial of three cigarette manufacturers. The companies are charged with misleading the public about the dangers of cigarettes and contributing to the 1984 death of <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>, 58. Defense summations came exactly four months after the case opened in federal court with a lawyer for widower <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> outlining the case against <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Lorillard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The case rests on `` the simple proposition that if you believe the testimony of <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> and her family, that she smoked cigarettes because she wanted to and because she liked to, even though she knew the risks,'' then the jury `` should return a verdict for <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON>, an attorney for <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION>. `` Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> enjoyed smoking, and that was why she continued to smoke, and she did n't want anyone to tell her not to do it,'' he said. <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON> reviewed testimony by Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>'s relatives, including her brother, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> DeFrancesco </PERSON>, who said their mother blamed their father's death on smoking. `` The point is, before Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> even started smoking, she was hearing these kinds of stories from her mother,'' <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON> said. Shortly after Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> met her husband-to-be, she told him `` she had a bad habit'' _ smoking, <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>'s own testimony on the stand. `` She knew what she was doing, she knew what she was saying. She was an intelligent, strong-minded person,'' <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON> said, noting that Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> took a job over her husband's objections. Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> knew that other family members had quit cold turkey and that she was able to control her habit, not smoking in the bedroom, at dinner or on the job, said <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON>. `` The point is, she did not want to'' quit, he said. <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON>, in his 3 -LCB- - hour summation, asserted that cigarettes are not a proven cancer cause, and said controversy on the issue still rages `` It's a free country. People have a right to express their opinion, based on the evidence,'' <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON> said. `` It's their First Amendment right, and corporations have the right too.'' Closing arguments for the other companies' attorneys were scheduled for Thursday. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> charges that the companies, through inadequate research and a failure to publicize what they did know about the dangers of smoking, should be held liable for damages in his wife's death About 150 spectators, including lawyers, financial analysts, reporters and others packed the courtroom for final arguments. If the jury decides for <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> and awards him damages, it would be the first time a tobacco company has been ordered to pay liability claims brought by smokers and their families. The lawsuit, filed in 1983, is one of fewer than a dozen by smokers or their relatives to reach a jury. A Cipollone victory could spur similar lawsuits, some lawyers say. Their tobacco industry opponents argue that a defeat for <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> could perhaps stifle for good such lawsuits because of the effort, time and expense. Anti-smoking advocates and lawyers have already hailed the <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> case as a victory of sorts because of the unprecedented look into the inner workings of the industry through a wealth of confidential documents introduced into evidence by <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>'s lawyers Anti-tobacco litigators say these documents will help them in future lawsuits. Health groups said the revelations have already spurred members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to step up legislative action limiting the tobacco industry. For example, an industry trade group executive wrote in a 1972 memorandum that the defense against critics of smoking included `` creating doubt about the health charge without actually denying it.'' Tobacco company lawyers have denied such a strategy. Through a series of pre-trial rulings and a major decision last month by the trial judge, <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarokin </PERSON>, most of <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>'s claims were cut from his lawsuit Essentially, the jury in the civil case must decide two types of claims against all three companies, and two specifically against <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION>. They must determine whether each company intentionally misrepresented claims about the health consequences of smoking and whether each conspired to do so. As for <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION>, the jury will consider claims under state liability laws _ whether the company failed to warn the public about the risks of its products, and whether <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> violated its warranty duties. Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> smoked <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION>'s cigarettes before 1966, the year warnings were put on cigarette packs, which the courts have said pre-empted failure-to-warn claims after that year. Both sides presented two dozen witnesses, including top tobacco company executives, company researchers, physicians, medical experts, advertising and marketing experts and <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> family members. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>, 64, in his testimony, tearfully described the progression of his wife's lung cancer and their final moments together in the hospital where she died. The jury also heard pre-trial testimony from Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>, who spoke of her infatuation with cigarette-smoking movie stars and desperate fear of illness caused by cigarettes.

<HEAD>Ethanol Producers File Lawsuit Against Oil Companies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DANVILLE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Seven ethanol producers filed a $ 2.1 billion antitrust lawsuit in <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday, alleging that four major oil companies conspired to discourage the sale of ethanol. The defendants are <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Marathon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, one of the attorneys who filed the lawsuit, charged that the oil companies made inaccurate and misleading statements against gasohol _ a blend of 10 percent ethanol and 90 percent gasoline `` The clearest evidence of what the oil companies have done is labeling,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said at a news conference. He said signs at some of the oil companies' service stations say: `` Our gasoline contains no alcohol or ethanol,'' or `` Our gasoline is clean.'' `` Those sorts of signs and labels would clearly infer ... there is something wrong with alcohol or ethanol,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. Spokespeople for the oil companies had no immediate comment. As a result of the oil companies' campaign, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said the ethanol market has `` effectively dried up,'' with producers suffering significant economic damages. The plaintiffs include <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rockford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Rockford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Shepherd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>.; <ORGANIZATION> Vidalia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethanol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of Vidalia, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>.; <ORGANIZATION> Alpebo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>.; <ORGANIZATION> Shreveport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethanol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Shreveport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>.; <ORGANIZATION> Lakefield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethanol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Lakefield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> A. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> E. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont </LOCATION><LOCATION> . </LOCATION> Ethanol is made from corn, and if the ethanol industry had been allowed to grow, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said it would have had a `` tremendous effect on agriculture.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said ethanol also is good for the environment since it can reduce harmful emissions from automobile exhausts. The lawsuit also said the defendants refused to accept credit-card invoices from gasohol sales and terminated some retailers or distributors who did accept credit-card invoices for gasohol purchases. The companies also limited the availability of gasohol to consumers and refused to communicate or deal directly with the plaintiffs, the lawsuit contended. The ethanol manufacturers are asking for three times their actual damages of $ 700 million and for an injunction to stop the defendants from engaging in practices allegedly designed to hurt the ethanol market. `` Where this industry be without oil companies negatively advertising against our product would be speculation, but I believe it would be a lot larger,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Wentworth </PERSON>, first vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` The bottom line here is market-share. The major oil companies do n't want to give it up to independent blenders.''

<HEAD>Japan's Prime Minister Calls For Increased Mutual Trade</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: also on general news wires.</NOTE>

 Premier <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> said on Wednesday it `` goes without saying'' that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> must keep trying to open its markets wider to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He promptly added that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> will be trying to increase its own exports. He refused to say, however, what he thought the appropriate exchange rate should be between the dollar and the yen, commenting that `` God only knows'' the answer. Earlier Wednesday, the dollar weakened briefly in morning trading in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> after <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> governor <PERSON> Satoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sumita </PERSON> told reporters he thought a long-term rise in the dollar was unlikely. But the dollar soon recovered, closing in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> on Wednesday at 125.23 yen, up from 124.80 yen on Tuesday. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> held a news conference in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> after addressing the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>'s special session on disarmament. Asked about the balance of trade between <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> replied: `` It goes without saying that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> must continue with further efforts to open up the Japanese markets even more. Having said that, I should also like to add that there will be greater efforts to export <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s goods.'' He was less forthcoming about the outlook for exhange rates. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> will soon be meeting in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s Western allies for an economic summit, where the subject is likely to arise. He said that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> considers the Louvre Accord, which deals with policy coordination among the major countries on exchange rates, `` has been proceeding smoothly.'' `` As for that other question, what level of the exchange rate we think is most appropriate, I myself as well as our finance minister make it the rule to say that ` It is something that God only knows,''' the prime minister remarked. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> spoke in Japanese, aided by an interpreter. He declined to characterize progress on another thorny U.S.-Japanese trade issue _ <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to sell more beef and citrus products in the highly protective Japanese market. Noting that bilateral talks on the issue were under way, he said he did not want to prejudice the negotiations and would offer no comment. Earlier Wednesday, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> pledged increased efforts by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in the cause of disarmament and world peace, including sending Japanese technicians and advisers to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> to monitor elections and to repair transportation, communication and medical services. He congratulated President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on achieving the intermediate-range nuclear forces -LRB- INF -RRB- treaty scrapping medium and shorter-range nuclear missles, which took effect Wednesday. At the same time, he enunciated a Japanese policy of cautious disarmament based on negotiation. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> is scheduled to meet <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Friday in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, where the president will brief Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> on the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit.
