 Hundreds of local law enforcement officers were buying and selling cocaine Friday in sting operations across the state aimed at slowing down street-level drug traffic. Operation Rock Pile made at least 480 arrests Friday during its first night. `` To our knowledge it's the first time anything like this has been done,'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Crolius </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's spokesman, said in a telephone interview from the <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> command center. The <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriffs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> organized the operation. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON>, an assistant project director with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriffs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said he had never heard of local law enforcement agencies working together in a statewide effort _ although other states have had statewide operations organized from a state level. Fifteen city police departments and at least 61 of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s 66 sheriff's departments are participating, according to <PERSON> Crolius </PERSON>, who estimated that more than 1,000 officers were involved in the project. <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, which has a countywide police department rather than a sheriff's office, is also participating. The crackdown was scheduled to end midnight Saturday. The operation is targeted equally at buyers and sellers, and includes both `` buy busts,'' which result in the arrests of dealers, and reverse stings, which result in the arrests of users. Search warrants will be served as well. Most arrests will probably be made in urban areas like <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> counties, the <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> area and <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Crolius </PERSON> said.

 Authorities have arrested members of a Marxist group that killed two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missionaries and bombed the motorcade of ex-U.S. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> during a visit last year, the government said. `` In recent days, we apprehended three important members of the group <PERSON> Zarate </PERSON> <PERSON> Willka </PERSON>,'' one of whom confessed to the motorcade attack, Interior Minister <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Beltran </PERSON> told a news conference Thursday night. The <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zarate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Willka </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility for the killings in May of <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>, both 20-year-old Mormon missionaries from <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. Police found a copy of the group's message to the media on the killings when they searched the residence of brothers <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nestor </PERSON> <PERSON> Encinas </PERSON> <PERSON> Laguna </PERSON>, the interior minister said. Authorities also found explosives and detonators there. <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Encinas </PERSON> <PERSON> Laguna </PERSON>, a sociology student, and his brother, a member of the technical faculty at a local university, were at large. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Beltran </PERSON> said sociology student <PERSON> Constantino </PERSON> <PERSON> Uujra </PERSON>, alias <PERSON> Pancho </PERSON>, was arrested. The interior minister said the suspect confessed to the attack in August last year during <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s visit. In the attack, an assailant threw an explosive device near the motorcade taking <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> from the airport to the city center. The blast broke the windows of some vehicles but there were no injuries. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Beltran </PERSON> said authorities also arrested the group's ideologue, physician <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rojas </PERSON>, and medical student <PERSON> Telma </PERSON> <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON>, identified as another group member Ball, of <LOCATION> Coalville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Wellington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, were gunned down late May 24 as they returned to their apartment in downtown La Paz. The two were machine gunned by occupants of a small yellow car. <PERSON> Zarate </PERSON> <PERSON> Willka </PERSON> is named after a leader of a civil uprising in 1890 against a law permitting the sale of communal land used by peasants.

 Police swarmed through gang-infested neighborhoods Friday night in the first widespread dragnet for drug-dealing street thugs since the highly-publicized sweeps dubbed the `` Hammer'' last summer. The eight-hour operation on the eve of the July Fourth holiday weekend targeted gangs in the three neighborhoods terrorized by gangs. Assistant Chief <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> told 300 officers at a 4 p.m. roll call that they should remember many residents are law-abiding citizens. Portable booking trailers were set up at the Police Department's Southeast Division station in the heart of the <LOCATION> Watts </LOCATION> district which was ravaged by riots in 1965 Police made 70 arrests in the first four hours of the operation, 30 of them narcotics felonies, and 19 of those arrested were identified as gang members, said police Detective <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Celli </PERSON>. Twenty vehicles lacking current registration tags were impounded, he said. `` We are here to enforce all the laws that are applicable,'' said <PERSON> Celli </PERSON>. Community outcry over gang thugs who keep residents prisoners in their own homes prompted the first full-scale police assault in April 1988. The 1,000-officer weekend sweeps continued at intervals through the summer. Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, a former police lieutenant sworn to a fifth term Friday, vowed during the first of the 1,000-officer gang task force sweeps 15 months ago: `` We are going to take these terrorists off the streets of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>.'' Gang violence continued unabated. More than one person died in a county gang-related killing for every day of 1988. There were 452 gang-related slayings in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in 1988, surpassing the 387 gang-related murders reported the year before.

 In the inlets of <ORGANIZATION> Prince </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sound </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> workers flush gooey crude from the craggy shore back into the sea so it can be skimmed. The glop, which has the consistency of mayonnaise, is mixed with sediment, seaweed and other flotsam. But instead of being burned or buried, some of it is going to a <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> refinery where it can be salvaged as fuel. `` They're probably going to try to get every nickel they can, even if it's turned into asphalt, to try to recover some of their costs,'' said <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a scientist with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>. `` I'd rather see them refine the stuff than incinerate it or put it in a landfill,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` It's still fuel It still has heat potential.'' Nearly 11 million gallons of North Slope crude smeared Alaskan waters three months ago, and almost 1 million gallons of fuel slicked three sites within 13 hours last weekend. Environmentalists and oil company executives may cry over the spilled cargo, but salvagers are going to work recycling as much of it as they can. `` It's better to use it for it's intended purpose than have it otherwise foul the environment. Out of these tragedies, we'd like to see the best made out of a bad situation,'' said <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. The ooze is piling up after the latest tanker accidents. About 210,000 gallons of goop was put in storage tanks near <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, after the Panamanian tanker Rachel-B collided with a barge in the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> Ship Channel. `` The material is relatively clean,'' said Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> has stored about 10 million gallons of fuel and a blend of oil and water skimmed from <LOCATION> Narragansett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> after the Greek tanker World Prodigy hit <LOCATION> Brenton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reef </LOCATION>. The ship's owner is working on a salvage plan. `` Our job is to keep it out of the water. We're not sure how much can be recycled,'' said Lt. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>. The stickiest problem may be the 243,802 gallons of gunk recovered from the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> after the Uruguayan tanker <PERSON> Presidente </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> dropped anchor too soon and lurched into shallow water. The fuel is so heavy it must be heated before it can be pumped. When it mixed with water, the spillage congealed into basketball-sized, fudgelike clumps. The state of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> set up four temporary disposal sites, and it probably will be buried or burned, officials said. `` That stuff coming out of the river is non-recyclable. It's ruined It has no value,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Caron </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Guardian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in Bear, Del. In the calamitous Alaskan spill, procedures are simplified because <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> owned the tanker and the cargo that gushed into the sea. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> has shipped about 2 millions gallons of goo that is 30 to 50 percent oil to <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> EnviroServices </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, for refining. The brew contains water, sand, seaweed and other junk scooped up by the skimmers, but it can still be refined into gasoline, kerosene and diesel fuel. `` We would expect to derive some useful energy out of it,'' said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Dragnich </PERSON>, waste manager for <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>. `` But the value of recovery is inconsequential in terms of the cost of the cleanup and environmental damage. You're trying to have the least overall negative impact.'' `` Once we remove the water and debris, it can be used in a wide spectrum of petroleum-related uses,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Banchero </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> EnviroServices </ORGANIZATION>. `` One of our foremost goals is to reduce the volume that has to be disposed of.'' <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> has been burning some non-recyclable oily trash at three small hospital incinerators in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> while it tries to obtain federal permits to fire up large furnaces on barges. Burial is costly because <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> has no hazardous waste sites; crude-tainted garbage is being shipped to <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. Even recycling carries a high price tag. `` It's very costly to recycle oil loaded with lots of junk. The cost of refining may be way beyond the value of the oil,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, an industry group.

<TEXT>
 Faced with the wrath of crabby cabbies, miffed motorists and irate casino owners, officials hope a new curfew will detour thousands of cruisin' teens who transform the glitzy <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> into a giant parking lot. Two years ago the teen-agers were considered a nuisance by <ORGANIZATION> Las </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vegas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> as they tried to control cruising and congregating. `` Then we were talking about 500, maybe 1,000 kids on a weekend night,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capt </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Connett </PERSON>, who is commander of the police detachment covering the Strip area. `` It was a manageable number. Now we're talking upwards of 4,000 kids on a given night. The problem has mushroomed out of proportion.'' The problem is blamed on the Strip's growing popularity among teens and the growth of the city _ from 300,000 eight years ago to more than 700,000 today. `` The numbers were overwhelming,'' <PERSON> Connett </PERSON> said. `` We tried to control the blocking of the Strip, but all we could do was herd them up and down the Strip, unless people were willing to hire 500 more officers'' to bolster the current Strip contingent of 16. Casino owners are unhappy because the teens sometimes hassle tourists, often bumping them into the busy Strip traffic, <PERSON> Connett </PERSON> said. Cab drivers complain it takes forever to drive a few blocks as teens drive side-by-side down the six-lane road at 5 to 10 mph, exchanging conversations, obscenities, even passengers. The traffic problem is compounded by the fact that 45 percent of the city's visitors come here by car _ leaving more than 10,000 cars, hundreds of cabs and scores of tour buses jockeying for position on any given weekend. In addition, teen-agers who used to cruise past casinos on <LOCATION> Fremont </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, also known as Glitter Gulch, now drive the Strip because they were chased away by anti-cruising forces in the late 1970s. Flooded with letters from upset tourists and hammered by those who make a living from the city's $ 2.5 billion tourism industry, the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> huddled with county officials and police in search of a solution. `` It came down to finding a way to get the kids off the Strip earlier,'' <PERSON> Connett </PERSON> said. `` What we're talking about here is an ` adults only' park in a manner of speaking.'' The answer was a curfew restricting those under 18 from the Strip after 9 p.m. Fridays, Saturdays and holidays, unless accompanied by an adult. The curfew went into force June 23 and police reported many warnings, but no arrests for curfew violations. <PERSON> Connett </PERSON> said officers will warn teens about the curfew for an unspecified grace period before turning offenders over to juvenile authorities. Teens with legitimate purposes on the Strip, such as visiting restaurants, are exempt as long as they can explain their presence. Violators will be detained until their parents pick them up and repeat offenders will be sent to Juvenile Hall. Unhappy teens, who have become accustomed to sharing the neon-bathed Strip that some call a `` Disneyland for adults,'' have responded to the cruising ban with the generations-old response `` We have no place to go, nothing to do.'' `` That's idiotic,'' <PERSON> Connett </PERSON> says. `` It's the dumbest thing I've ever heard out of a kid's mouth This city has probably done as much or more for its kids than any city in the country. `` Some children could be in the center of <LOCATION> Disneyland </LOCATION> and say they have nothing to do,'' she said. <PERSON> Connett </PERSON> noted the city has snow skiing and water skiing 30 minutes away plus a water theme park, free parks, recreation centers, movies, ice and roller skating rinks, arcades and other attractions. But <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> teens _ or at least a vocal minority _ want to head for the flashy Strip to mingle with some 100,000 tourists who flock here each weekend.

<HEAD>Elderly Woman Fights City in Dispute Over Can Collecting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Honey <PERSON> Breske </PERSON> is trying to make ends meet by recycling, but prosecutors have taken the 92-year-old widow to court over the pile of trash in her yard. Now she is looking for a job to earn the money for the court battle. `` Spry ... widow seeking any employment,'' her advertisement reads. `` Need funds to fight Housing Court. They wo n't let me recycle cans for cash.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Breske </PERSON> placed the ad in a weekly newspaper after the city went to court to force her to clear debris from her yard, where she keeps aluminum cans, boxes and other junk she recycles to supplement her $ 369 monthy Social Security income. Her neighbors complained about the mess. `` I do n't think it's fair. These things did n't happen until our husbands died,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Breske </PERSON> said. `` Then they started picking on us.'' One of Mrs. <PERSON> Breske </PERSON>'s friends, <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunlap </PERSON>, is in trouble with the city for the same reason. The court has issued a permanent injunction against storing debris in her yard and issued more than $ 10,000 in fines over the last 12 years. `` I ca n't pay nothing,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Dunlap </PERSON>, 70. City attorneys handling such cases say many elderly residents are turning up in Housing Court, accused of creating dangerous piles of refuse in attempts to earn money. `` We have one to two cases every week with this type of problem,'' said <PERSON> Dolores </PERSON> <PERSON> Quiroz </PERSON>, the assistant corporation counsel prosecuting Mrs. <PERSON> Breske </PERSON>. `` And that's a conservative estimate. Sometimes it's one or two a day.'' The city gets involved in cases where debris poses possible fire and health hazards. `` It was not just a matter of cans and things like that,'' she said. `` The problem is that they keep collecting it, and it's causing serious problems with the neighbors. Mrs. <PERSON> Breske </PERSON> finds recyclable items by rummaging through alleys in her neighborhood. She started collecting about 10 years ago just after her husband, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON>, was hospitalized for a heart attack. He died five years later, leaving Mrs. <PERSON> Breske </PERSON> with a $ 45,000 hospital bill. She emptied her bank account and sold jewelry to help pay it. `` I went looking for a job a couple of times. When I told them my age, they said, ` What do you want to work for?''' she said. `` So I got tired of that. I said, ` I'll just go pick cans.'''

 Police arrested at least seven striking <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> pilots and employees Friday as they stopped their cars in a baggage area at <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s big airport on one of its busiest days. `` It is a grassroots movement,'' said <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Eastern pilots union in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` Some disgruntled Eastern strikers, including non-union people, are trying to show their frustration.'' Those arrested were charged with misdemeanors _ disobeying an officer and impeding the flow of traffic _ and nearly all of the arrested were pulled from cars at an Eastern baggage area at <LOCATION> Hartsfield-Atlanta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. Other strikers gathered signatures on petitions that called for a continued boycott of the airline, which has been crippled by a four-month strike. `` We asked them to move along, but they wanted to shut down this airport,'' said police Maj. W.B. <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>. `` This was an obvious attempt by the union to hurt the citizens of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. We do n't like it, and we're not going to take it.'' Airport spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Braden </PERSON> said Friday was one of the busiest days in <ORGANIZATION> Hartsfield </ORGANIZATION>'s history, with about 140,000 travelers passing through the airport. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, about 300 Eastern strikers and supporters marched on Friday to <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> and blocked evening rush-hour traffic heading to the terminal of <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s sister airline. About 50 police wearing riot gear and holding night sticks tried to keep the crowd moving through the airport's roads, and another 50 tried to control Friday's rush hour traffic. There was no violence and no arrests were reported. `` The intent is to tell everyone in the whole world that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s still on strike,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Borowick </PERSON>, president of Local 1445 of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Borowick </PERSON> said the union was under a court-ordered limit of 15 pickets per entrance, but marchers took over the four traffic lanes where passengers debark to get to <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s departure counters for about an hour. Similar plans to greet <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> travelers with airport slowdowns failed to materialize. A few strikers drove slowly through <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, but they were moved along by special police teams. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s boss <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> warned that striking pilots who might want to come back to work likely will find they've already been bumped from their jobs `` We're not dependent on the pilots coming back, by any means,'' said <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s parent company, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Pilots union officials were to meet this weekend with management and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s court-appointed bankruptcy examiner for talks on a contract agreement to end their walkout against the company <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> said the slowdown was n't sanctioned by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s unions, which mark four months on strike July 4. But strikers from the pilots, flight attendants and <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> unions said they would drive their cars slowly through airport terminal areas on Friday afternoon, and possibly next Tuesday. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunther </PERSON>, operations director at <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, said extra police officers and tow trucks were called out to lessen traffic tie-ups. He said holiday travelers should leave an hour or so earlier than usual to allow for possible delays. `` If the unions pull off this blockade-type activity, my reaction would be they're making the traveling public the innocent victims in a labor-management dispute,'' <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said. Eastern, meanwhile, was gearing up for a tripling of its daily schedule. With 79 daily flights this week, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> was set to hit 226 daily flights beginning Sunday. `` We have to see whether they can make the announced schedule and whether they can sustain it for seven days,'' <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> said. `` Watch for canceled flights. They do n't have enough pilots.'' The carrier has been operating less than 10 percent of its pre-strike schedule of around 1,000 flights a day since the strike that started March 4. It filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization on March 9 and says it will rebuild as a smaller airline. In an interview Friday, <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> said any returning strikers would find most of the available jobs at the new, scaled-down Eastern were taken up by the 500 or so new hires and 300 who crossed picket lines who already are working and by other pilots who will complete training in the weeks ahead. Eastern also is near agreement with creditors over its plan to emerge from bankruptcy court protection as a scaled-down carrier that would require only about 1,700 pilots to operate by December at its target level of around two-thirds of its pre-strike size. That compares with the 3,600 that flew the pre-strike version. The unions are backing a buyout bid for Eastern led by <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> commodities trader <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON>.

 Toads have invaded a street in this <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> town and no one seems to mind. Thousands of thumbnail-size toads have taken over Spruce Lane and cover driveways, back yards, patios and the street. There are so many that residents have to take special care when walking and have given up mowing the lawns. `` They're just babies and we are afraid we'll run over them,'' said <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON>. `` When we go out, we just tippy-toe out of our house so we do n't step on them.''

<HEAD>Government Settles Ohio Nuclear Weapons Lawsuit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has tentatively agreed to pay at least $ 73 million to <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> residents who claimed damage by radioactive contamination from a government-owned plant near <LOCATION> Fernald </LOCATION> that produces nuclear weapons materials. A lawsuit filed by five residents as a class action had sought $ 300 million. The settlement underscores the government's intensified effort to regain public confidence in its nuclear weapons program, which is run from 17 major plants in 12 states. Many of the sites are badly polluted from four decades of bomb making. The government has acknowledged that at least 383,000 pounds of radioactive uranium oxide dust had been released through faulty filters at the Fernald facility since the plant opened in 1951. The full extent of environmental damage has not been determined. <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Roselle </PERSON>, one of the attorneys for the 14,000 people living within five miles of the plant who are represented in the class action, said the settlement allows for an additional $ 5 million payment to nearby businesses if they can show lost property value. <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, the deputy energy secretary, said the terms were approved by <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> late Friday and would be presented to U.S. District Judge <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> next week. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> has said he would step up department efforts to resolve past environmental damage from nuclear weapons plants and limit future harm. `` It's a major concern to us,' said <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>. `` This whole idea of this lawsuit, with people being upset, diminution of property values _ all these kinds of things would not have occurred if we had done it right in the past.'' <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> earlier this week blamed his own department for disarray in the weapons program, saying key managers and supervisors lacked technical skills and some lacked the necessary discipline for safe operation of nuclear reactors. The congressman whose district includes the plant predicted more lawsuits by people who live near contaminated bomb factories. `` It's a tragedy that the taxpayers are bearing the brunt of 35 years of contamination and concealment,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Luken </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION> In the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> lawsuit, residents near the Feed Materials Production Center at <LOCATION> Fernald </LOCATION>, about 18 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, said radioactive contamination from the uranium plant polluted soil, air and water in their area. They claimed this caused them mental stress and reduced the value of their property. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said he sympathized with the public's concerns about possible illegal pollution from nuclear weapons plants, but he expressed doubt about the <PERSON> Fernald </PERSON> claims. `` A lot of that is hysteria,'' he said. `` There really was n't, judging by what I heard ... a lot of hard evidence of anybody losing anything _ as a matter of fact, almost none.'' He said he believed the settlement, if made final, would be the first of its kind. Judge <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> scheduled an Aug. 23 hearing on the agreement. If the judge approves the settlement, the government must deposit the money into four <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> banks no later than Oct. 15, said <PERSON> Roselle </PERSON>. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> earlier this month recommended in a mock trial that the Fernald residents be awarded $ 136 million. The recommendation was issued as a non-binding verdict, a procedure used in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> to encourage settlement of a lawsuit before it goes to trial. The plant was run for the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> by </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lead </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, until 1986. The residents' group filed suit against <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lead </ORGANIZATION> and its parent company, but the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> has accepted responsibility for its contractor because of an indemnification clause in its contract, and the government has provided defense counsel to its contractor.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, marking the 25th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, says he will be satisfied `` with nothing less than equality of opportunity for all Americans'' including 36 million who have disabilities. `` While celebrating our achievements and recommitting ourselves to their preservations, we must recognize that the full promise of the civil rights movement has still not been achieved,'' he told 200 civil rights leaders at a White House ceremony Friday. `` The hard lesson of the passing years is that it has not been enough to wage a war against the old forms of bigotry and inequality,'' the president said before flying off for a long holiday weekend in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` to join me in a new partnership to reauthorize the <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> with a goal of launching a renewed civil rights mission.'' The commission's six-year authorization expires Nov. 30. Civil rights leaders <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooks </PERSON>, <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Farmer </PERSON> attended the ceremony. The landmark civil rights law was signed by President <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> on July 2, 1964. The act banned segregation in public accommodations and paved the way for court action to end bias in hiring and promotions. Also in the audience was <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Parks </PERSON>, whose defiant refusal to move to the back of a <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, bus on Dec. 1, 1955, was an early milestone in the civil rights movement. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the gathering was `` not only to commemorate an anniversary, but to celebrate a movement, and to rededicate our efforts to the unfinished work of that movement.'' However, some civil rights leaders say recent <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decisions restricting affirmative action and making it more difficult to prove discrimination in the workplace have hurt the civil rights movement. `` There was more damage done to civil rights statutes in the last 2 -LCB- weeks than in the last 2 -LCB- decades,'' said <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Neas </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not directly address civil rights leaders' concerns, but called for `` vigilant and aggressive enforcement'' of civil rights and said his administration wo n't tolerate discrimination. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told reporters that justice had become `` more expensive, more distant and less likely to come'' because of the high court rulings. He said `` we need a meeting of some substance with the president to deal with legislative remedies to offset the impact'' of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decisions. But some said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> seems more interested in defending the flag than the ideals the flag represents, alluding to his call for a constitutional amendment to outlaw desecration of the flag. `` So far they have put flag rights over workers' rights, over basic civil rights,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said after the ceremony. Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> earlier this week that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration wo n't pursue legislation to overturn the recent high court decisions affecting civil rights, preferring to wait until their impact can be assessed. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said economic barriers affect the lives of the disadvantaged as much as the remnants of legal discrimination. `` For that reason, I continue to support affirmative action and minority outreach programs,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` We will be satisfied with nothing less than equality of opportunity for all Americans _ and the removal of final barriers to self-reliance.''

 Nearly 20 years after Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s car plunged off the bridge at <LOCATION> Chappaquiddick </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, several grand jurors who investigated the accident have come forward to say the district attorney hindered their probe. One of the jurors, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maciel </PERSON>, said Friday that there was a `` cover up'' in the case, but said he believed <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was the victim, not the perpetrator. `` I think the man is innocent,'' <PERSON> Maciel </PERSON> said. `` I do n't believe <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was driving that car. I think he took the blame for somebody else.'' <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopechne </PERSON>, a 28-year-old secretary, was a passenger in <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION>'s Oldsmobile when it skidded off Dike Bridge in <PERSON> Martha </PERSON>'s Vineyard on July 19, 1969 Trapped in the vehicle, she drowned in 8 feet of water in a tidal pond. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Democrat, who did not report the accident to police until 10 hours later, received a suspended sentence for leaving the scene. <PERSON> Maciel </PERSON> and the grand jury foreman, <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, said former District Attorney <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinis </PERSON> prevented the 23-member jury from calling several key witnesses, including <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and his cousin, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Gargan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, because they had previously testified at an inquest. <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, a 49-year-old pharmacist on <PERSON> Martha </PERSON>'s Vineyard, said <PERSON> Dinis </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Dukes </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutor, also refused to let the grand jury read the transcript of the inquest. `` When those two avenues were closed off, there was nothing for us to do really but go home,'' <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dinis </PERSON>, who is now in private practice in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION>, did not return telephone calls from The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> to his home and office Friday. He previously has denied stonewalling the investigation and has said there was not enough evidence to justify indicting <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> for manslaughter. <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> and <PERSON> Maciel </PERSON> said they have spoken out after two decades because they want the truth to come out and to clear the grand jury's name. `` I've lived with this thing for 20 years, and there have been all these innuendos that we were bought off,'' <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> said. `` The bottom line is, the grand jury tried its hardest to get to the truth, but we were not able to do our job.'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> has said he made a wrong turn that night and ended up on the narrow Dike Bridge. He also has said that he and a friend repeatedly dove to the car in unsuccessful rescue attempts, and that afterward he was `` exhausted and in a state of shock.'' <PERSON> Maciel </PERSON>, who owns a boatyard on <PERSON> Martha </PERSON>'s Vineyard, said he did not believe that <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, a frequent visitor to the island, would have made that wrong turn. He said he did not know why <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> would have taken the blame for someone else, `` unless it was someone very young.''

<HEAD>Inspector General Says HUD Ignored Warnings</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>'s inspector general says the agency ignored repeated warnings for tighter controls on lenders in a troubled program now under <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> investigation. `` On at least five occasions ... we have reported to <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> management and to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that program improvements were needed,'' said <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Inspector General <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> as the House Government Operations housing and employment subcommittee began hearings Friday on the program. The program, known as `` coinsurance'' because the government assumed part of the liability on loans with lenders, showed signs of problems two years after it was instituted in 1983 as a hallmark of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration efforts to turn the functions of many government programs over to private business. A November 1985 internal audit of eight projects showed `` inappropriate lender underwriting practices caused inflated mortgages,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. The subcommittee has been examining possible abuse, influence-peddling and mismanagement in <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> programs during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials promised to `` improve lender monitoring processes and enforcement actions,'' although they rejected <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' assessment of the problems and said controls he suggested were so strict they would discourage participation, he said. Lenders are paid an annual fee of about 4 percent of a project's operating income as an incentive to repair, rehabilitate or build low - and moderate-income multi-family If a borrower defaults, lenders are responsible for about 20 percent of the loss while <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> picks up the tab for the remaining 80 percent. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> now faces more than $ 100 million in claims against bad loans made in the program, said Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, D-Calif., subcommittee chairman In the most recent audit in March 1989, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> found the <ORGANIZATION> Benton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, had misrepresented mortgage amounts and rents on 14 projects it had underwritten, creating an estimated $ 22 million in excessive mortgages, said <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>. He said the government would pay excessive subsidies of $ 37 million over the 15-year period of contracts for rental housing <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> had coinsured. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> is one of three companies which has been placed on six months' probation from the program. Three companies have been suspended and three others are under review by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> revealed Friday that <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> is the subject of a grand jury investigation, which he said he would not discuss. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said his first report of problems in the coinsurance program was sent to then-Assistant Secretary of Housing <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, one of several former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> employees who was paid as a consultant on projects funded under the moderate rehabilitation program. Rep. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, D-Conn., observed that `` <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> used <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> in all of his deals,'' in that program Meanwhile, congressional pressure is mounting for a complete review of the housing department. One staffer said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Banking, <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, D-Mich., has sent a letter to panel members seeking authorization for an investigation Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs subcommittee on housing, said Friday he would vote for a probe of the `` scandal-ridden'' department And <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> would testify before his panel July 12 to discuss reform measures being developed in the agency.

<TEXT>
 The National Space Council has decided to urge President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to keep the `` space plane'' alive but limit its development program to the testing of unproven technology. The program is aimed at the development of a plane capable of taking off from a conventional runway, going into orbit and landing on a regular runway. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> called it the `` <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>'' for the projected two-hour flight time from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> proposed eliminating the project or transferring to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> most of the $ 427 million proposed by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget for the next fiscal year. The council recommended the project get $ 254 million next year, shared equally by <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said in its Saturday editions. A spokesman for Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, chairman of the council, said Friday night he did not have dollar figures for the recommendations. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> recommended $ 412 million, with $ 127 million from <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>. A council staff member who spoke on condition of anonymity said the program's focus had expanded over the past four years, so that nuts-and-bolts questions like payload were being considered before researchers had proven with an experimental craft that the plane would be able to fly at 25 times the speed of sound. Nearly $ 2 billion has been spent on the program over the past four years. Potential contractors have spent $ 700 million of their own funds.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> is proposing a broad overhaul of top <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> committees that would give a small group the power to make major decisions, according to an administration source. <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION>, responding to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s request for a review of defense management, recently sent the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> a proposal to form an `` Executive Committee'' that would assume many of the powers of the current <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, the source told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> late Friday. `` We are waiting for the president's decisions,'' the source said. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which advises <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION> on major weapons and budgetary decisions, would become the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> with a broader planning task. It would be subordinate to the Executive Committee, which would be comprised of the secretary, the deputy secretary, the undersecretary for policy, the undersecretary for acquisitions, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION> and the secretaries of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. `` These are the people who are setting the policy anyway,'' said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> also would reorganize the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acquisitions </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> in an effort to `` streamline the lines of authority in procurement in carrying out acquisition policies down through the service acquisition chiefs and program managers,'' the source said. The acquisitions board would scrutinize the cost and performance tradeoff decisions made in the early stages of a weapons program. The service secretaries would be dropped from the acquisitions board, `` cut out of the loop, but at the same time they would be put back in at the top'' through membership on the Executive Committee, the source said. The source largely confirmed an account of <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION>'s plans first reported Friday night by <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, a weekly journal of defense policy and politics.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration says it is looking for help from the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> in holding elections on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. `` If they can be responsible and constructive here in helping, great,'' <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said Friday while defending two unannounced meetings in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Salah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalaf </PERSON>, the second-in-command to <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. But supporters of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> accelerated their criticism of the expanded dialogue <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON> is having in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dine </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said `` we are deeply distressed to learn that the administration has conducted secret meetings with the founder of Black September, one of the most brutal terrorists of recent years.'' <PERSON> Dine </PERSON> said in a statement that <PERSON> Khalaf </PERSON>, known also as <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Iyad </PERSON>, `` has publicly boasted of his terrorist deeds against Americans and Israelis and bragged about his ability to deceive the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' The head of the pro-Israel lobbying and research group called the meetings in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> `` a blow to the confidence necessary to move the peace process forward.'' <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reich </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presidents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Major </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizations </ORGANIZATION>, called <PERSON> Khalaf </PERSON> a `` notorious terrorist'' and said bringing him into the talks `` can only breed mistrust and cast suspicion on the depth of our country's longstanding commitments to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. On Thursday, Israeli Ambassador <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arad </PERSON>, registered his government's regret and disappointment in a meeting with Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>. <PERSON> Arad </PERSON> told the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> specialist on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> the meetings hurt prospects for holding the elections. The elections were proposed by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and endorsed by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> as a way of getting peace talks started. The idea is to have the 1.4 million Palestinian Arabs living under Israeli control on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> choose leaders who would negotiate temporary and local self-rule. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> would negotiate a permanent settlement in a second stage of talks. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has publicly criticized the plan as a device to prevent creation of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state. Spokeswoman <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> claimed only limited progress in the talks. `` I have no reason to believe that it has not been constructive,'' she said. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON> had held several unannounced meetings with various <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials and was likely to hold others. `` Our objective in the dialogue is to advance the peace process and to underscore our expectation that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> will adhere to its renunciation of terrorism,'' she said.

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> pharmaceutical company says its employees appear to have won government approval for one of the firm's generic drugs for treating high blood pressure by substituting the brandname product for its own in comparison tests. `` It would appear that that is the case,'' <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Vitarine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceuticals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gardens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, said Friday. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said he believes the company's drug, which has been recalled, is safe. A congressman, however, said the case raises questions about the drug's safety as well as the government's drug approval process. The drug is a generic Dyazide, a widely prescribed treatment for high blood pressure. <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beckman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> developed Dyazide and marketed it for 20 years before the first generic version was approved two years ago. <ORGANIZATION> Vitarine </ORGANIZATION> was approved in February 1988. <ORGANIZATION> Vitarine </ORGANIZATION> recalled its product a month ago. At least three employees have been suspended, the company said. However, <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said, preliminary results of a just-completed comparison study measuring the rate and extent of absorption of the two drugs shows that <ORGANIZATION> Vitarine </ORGANIZATION>'s product falls within an `` acceptable range.'' `` <ORGANIZATION> Vitarine </ORGANIZATION> has no reason to expect any safety or efficacy problems with this product. <ORGANIZATION> Vitarine </ORGANIZATION> has produced millions of dosage units since the product was first introduced in February 1988 and as of this date has received only six adverse experience reports,'' he said. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> declined to elaborate on the findings of the company's internal investigation, except to confirm that the company told the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> it suspected Dyazide was substituted for <ORGANIZATION> Vitarine </ORGANIZATION>'s product in comparison tests As a result, Dyazide would have been tested against only another sample of Dyazide. The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> investigations subcommittee, which brought the possibility to public light Thursday, said the case raises questions about how the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> approves generic drugs. `` Events suggest that we can no longer be assured that the products tested are the products marketed,'' said Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., subcommittee chairman `` That such a simple but apparently effective fraud could have gone undetected raises some serious new questions about the safety and efficacy of these drugs, and about the law,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> acknowledged that it is investigating the company, but spokesman <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Nesbit </PERSON> said he could n't comment on the inquiry or address the safety of the <ORGANIZATION> Vitarine </ORGANIZATION> drug. An <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the agency doubted the generic version was unsafe because it had undergone other tests and no problems with people using it had been reported.

<TEXT>
 The Secret Service does not know who authorized a private <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> tour allegedly given to members of a homosexual prostitution ring now under federal investigation, a spokesman says. The focus on private White House tours came after <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported that prominent <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lobbyist <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> arranged tours of the White House _ once around midnight _ for friends and business associates. The paper reported in its Friday editions that one such group included two male prostitutes from escort services that are now the subject of an investigation by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cramer </PERSON> said Friday that staffers holding <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passes can escort guests through the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wing </LOCATION>, site of the Oval Office, at special times. But he said records from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, when the tour in question allegedly occurred, are no longer available. One unidentified man quoted by the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> recalled a tour late on the night of July 3, 1988. <PERSON> Cramer </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> did not know who vouched for the party that night because all White House records from the period, including visitors' logs, have been shipped to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> for eventual placement in the <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> library, which has yet to be constructed. The Times said credit card records it obtained show that <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> frequently patronized a homosexual prostitution network that ran the escort services. <PERSON> Spence </PERSON>, once a registered foreign agent for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, is known as a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> power-broker whose parties during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration attracted prominent individuals including former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, journalist <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Koppel </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lilley </PERSON>, the ambassador to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> confirmed Thursday they are investigating possible credit card fraud involving the escort services, which operated under names such as `` Dream Boys'' and `` Man to Man.'' The investigation is based on records seized in raids on a house in an upscale <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> neighborhood that police say was used by the services. Police seized numerous bank statements, credit card slips and a diary of the business. The Times reported the ring was patronized by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials and congressional aides. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Balach </PERSON> resigned his job as Labor Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s political personnel liaison to the White House on Thursday after his name appeared in the Times' original story on the investigation. <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> spent thousands of dollars on the escort services, the Times said. On Oct. 5, 1988, for instance, he made four separate payments totaling $ 1,525 with his <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> card for male escorts from <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, it said. In the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, White House staff members can bring guests on private tours of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wing </LOCATION> on Monday, Wednesday and Friday between 7 p.m. and 10 p.m., after 1 p.m. on Saturday and all day on Sunday, <PERSON> Cramer </PERSON> said. Before a guest is cleared into the White House compound, a staff member must provide agents with information such as a date of birth and Social Security number.

 A federal judge has cleared the way for <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s sentencing next Wednesday in the Iran-Contra scandal. North, facing up to 10 years in prison and $ 750,000 in fines, lost a bid for a mistrial Friday. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said no evidence existed that a juror who gave the court inaccurate information was biased against the former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide. Juror <PERSON> Tara </PERSON> <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> responded ` no'' last Feb. 1 when asked whether she or relatives had been involved in court proceedings or an investigation. <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers disclosed after his trial that one of King's brothers had served time in prison for armed robbery and that the woman had testified before a grand jury in connection with the criminal investigation of her brother She testified Wednesday she forgot about the episode when she answered the courtroom questionnaire Feb. 1. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said in a nine-page order that King's testimony probably was n't believable, but that it did n't matter in deciding whether she was biased against <PERSON> North </PERSON>. `` The court can not credit King's testimony ... Her omission was knowing, but she had no desire to help or to hurt North or the prosecution,'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said in a nine-page order. ` No proof was presented indicating that King was unfair or that she failed in any way to serve conscientiously,'' he added. North was convicted May 4 for aiding and abetting an obstruction of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, altering and destroying documents and illegally accepting a gratuity. North had moved for the mistrial, saying King was prejudiced against <PERSON> North </PERSON>. ` She voted to acquit <PERSON> North </PERSON> of many felony counts,'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said of King. North was acquitted on nine other charges. The judge said that embarrassment and a desire to serve on the jury, rather than forgetfulness, were the reasons King failed to disclose the background information last February. <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers hired a private detective agency to investigate her background after she told a television interviewer she had used drugs, adding that she had stopped months before <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s trial. `` Situations of this type arise with some frequency in cases when the defense has ample resources,'' said the judge. `` They must be resolved in favor of the verdict when bias against the defendant has not been established in fact or by implication.''

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukens </PERSON> is confident of winning an appeal despite receiving a 30-day jail term for having sex with a 16-year-old girl, an aide said. The 58-year-old Republican was freed on a $ 100,000 surety bond Friday. Franklin County Domestic Relations Court Judge <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Solove </PERSON> sentenced <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> to the maximum penalty on the misdemeanor charge of contributing to the unruliness of a child, but overturned <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>' conviction of contributing to the delinquency of a minor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarrell </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>' chief of staff, said in an interview from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that the dropping of the delinquency charge was a `` very good sign for our appeal.'' <PERSON> Solove </PERSON>, citing <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>' apparent lack of remorse, told the congressman he was `` convinced you are a sex offender.'' The court was `` struck by the unwillingness of the defendant to recognize that he was not the victim,'' <PERSON> Solove </PERSON> said. `` You have refused to take that degree of responsibility.'' <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>, who is divorced, was convicted May 26 for paying <PERSON> Rosie </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> $ 40 to have sex with him at his <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> apartment on Nov. 6. <PERSON> Solove </PERSON> sentenced him to 180 days in jail and a $ 1,000 fine, but suspended all but 30 days of the sentence and $ 500 of the fine. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> was placed on probation for one year. <PERSON> Solove </PERSON> said the suspended sentence and fine depend on whether <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> follows terms of his probation, which require him to participate in sex offender programs and submit to testing for sexually transmitted diseases. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> left the courtroom without commenting to reporters. But <PERSON> Jarrell </PERSON> said the congressman had no need to show remorse. `` When Congressman <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>' conviction is overturned at the appeals level, Judge <PERSON> Solove </PERSON> will then understand why he showed no remorse. He is innocent,'' he said. Mrs. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON>, whose complaint about <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> led to his indictment, was escorted from the room immediately after the hearing. She is serving a jail term for violating probation stemming from a 1983 drunken driving conviction. Conviction on a misdemeanor does not automatically bar <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. He has vowed to remain in office and pursue his appeal. Local Republicans have called for <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> to resign, and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has been asked to investigate the case. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> served two terms in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from 1967 to 1970, when he lost a bid for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> gubernatorial nomination. After 15 years in the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, he was returned to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by voters in 1986.

 The National Right to <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s convention turned its aim from abortion to euthanasia, and members were urged to fight what one speaker called `` institutionalized heartlessness. `` Euthanasia is a clear and present danger in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bopp </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, general counsel of the committee, said Friday on the second day of the group's annual convention. Many who have strong convictions that abortion is wrong have n't taken such a firm stand on euthanasia, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON>, a member of the steering committee of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION>'s Program in Human Rights and Medicine `` We have to protect the elderly and disabled as we would protect ourselves,'' <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON> said. `` There is a movement toward institutionalized heartlessness, contempt and disdain for caring. Euthanasia is the necessary terminus of this movement,'' he said. `` People have died of deliberate dehydration. The patients did not ask to be starved to death and were not terminally ill.'' Dr. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> argued that artificial administration of nutrition and hydration is not the same as using extraordinary medical means to keep a patient alive The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> physician gained national attention when he refused a court order to withhold food and water from a 92-year-old Alzheimer's patient whose daughter wanted to end her life. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> said it was important that physicians know they have the right to follow their moral and ethical conscience. `` Having a physician's role in society defined by legislators or attorneys is a terrible, terrible thing,'' he said. `` We are all responsible for our own actions regarding our own conscience.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Steen </PERSON>, the committee's executive director, urged members to oppose euthanasia as strongly as they do abortion. Withholding artificial administration of food and water `` is really starving people to death,'' said <PERSON> O'Steen </PERSON>. The logical next step would be lethal injection, he maintained. `` When we come to this point, it will be too late,'' he said. `` The time to act is now because society at large has not yet accepted the stark reality of what is being done.''

 Tiananmen Square re-opened to the public Saturday, nearly four weeks after army tanks rolled into the vast grounds in a bloody suppression of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s pro-democracy movement. Hundreds of people who had obtained special permission filed through the square in orderly lines, gazing at the <LOCATION> Forbidden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s Gate of Heavenly Peace and the few soldiers who patrol the square Hundreds of cheerful tourists also gathered on the rostrum above the gate itself, where <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s revolutionary founder, <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>, declared the founding of the People's Republic four decades ago. There was no sign of the terror and grief that engulfed <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> June 3-4, when the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> stormed the square, shooting its way through hundreds of thousands of unarmed protesters. The government says about 300 people were killed, half of them soldiers. Chinese witnesses and Western diplomats say the deaths were in the thousands. Chinese tourists paid 10 yuan -LRB- $ 2.70 -RRB-, two days' wages for many workers, to stand atop the gate, which along with the square was re-opened to mark Saturday's 68th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Many enthusiastically snapped photographs and sought autographs from a senior military commander and a deputy mayor of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Groups of a dozen soldiers armed with AK-47 rifles marched by the gate every minute. <PERSON> Tiananmen </PERSON> opened a day after former <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> was stripped of his last government title. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, ousted as party general secretary a week ago, was dismissed by senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> as vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> is chairman of the commission. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> was effectively ousted more than a month ago, after he paid a tearful visit on May 19 to students on a hunger strike in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION>. He has not been seen since. President <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shangkun </PERSON>, who spent his career in the military, reportedly was seeking to replace <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> on the commission.

<HEAD>Thornburgh Rules IRA Member Should Be Deported</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> has decided that a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> should be deported to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>, where he has been convicted and sentenced to life in prison for killing a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> soldier. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> overruled an immigration appeals board finding that <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Doherty </PERSON> could reopen proceedings to seek political asylum. But <PERSON> Doherty </PERSON> can not be deported immediately because of a pending legal challenge to a 1988 deportation order by then-Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, said <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON>. The challenge is pending before the 2nd <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` In my discretion, I would not grant the respondent asylum,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. `` It is the policy of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that those who commit acts of violence against a democratic state should receive prompt and lawful punishment.'' Deporting <PERSON> Doherty </PERSON> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION> `` would unquestionably advance this important policy,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> wrote. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had previously determined that deporting <PERSON> Doherty </PERSON> `` is in the foreign policy interests of this country.'' The <PERSON> Doherty </PERSON> case has been the focus of political controversy, particularly among a group of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> who contend he should be treated as political refugee. <PERSON> Doherty </PERSON>'s supporters were upset by <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s decision. Rep. <PERSON> Eliot </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Engell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said it was `` an outrage that flies in the face of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> justice.'' `` It's morally, legally and politically indefensible,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, Republican comptroller of <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in the suburbs of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` Thornburgh is allowing the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the American legal system to be an accessory to <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s British government.'' Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, has also urged <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> to grant <PERSON> Doherty </PERSON>'s request for political asylum. <PERSON> Doherty </PERSON>, 34, was convicted of killing a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> captain during a 1980 ambush of British troops in Ulster. He escaped from a prison in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> the next year and was arrested in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in 1983. He has been held in federal custody since then. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> overruled a Nov. 14 <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeal </ORGANIZATION> ruling that <PERSON> Doherty </PERSON> could reopen his request for political asylum. The Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> began deportation proceedings in 1984 after a federal judge in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, ruled <PERSON> Doherty </PERSON> could not be extradited because his crime was a political act that made him eligible for asylum.

<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 State attorneys say they will fight a judge's decision to overturn a law requiring parental consent for abortions performed on minors in a case that could be affected by a long-awaited <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling. The parental consent law, passed by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in 1988, was to have taken effect today, two days before the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> was expected to announce action on a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> law seeking to limit legalized abortion. `` The statute's vagueness can be expected to have a substantial chilling effect upon a minor's right to obtain an abortion,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> said Friday in a ruling made after about an hour of oral arguments. The national Planned Parenthood Federation and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> challenged the law, seeking a preliminary injunction blocking its enforcement if the issue had not been decided Friday. Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Catalano </PERSON> said the state will consider an appeal to the 6th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> after reviewing <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s opinion. ` It's our contention that the statute is constitutional,'' he said. `` We intend to pursue the case to that end.'' <PERSON> Catalano </PERSON> also said the case could be affected by an upcoming ruling from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> law that restricts the availability of abortions and defines life as beginning at conception. The justices could rule Monday or order another round of arguments, delaying the decision until next year. `` If they rule, we'll read it with interest,'' <PERSON> Catalano </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Volunteers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION>, said his citizens' group, which lobbied for the 1988 legislation, may ask the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> to pass a new version of the parental consent law next year. The law would have made it a misdemeanor for a doctor to perform an abortion on a girl under age 18 without obtaining written permission from both her parents or her legal guardian. The statute allows exceptions, however, if the parents are divorced; if the pregnant girl wins a court waiver of the consent requirement; or if one parent can not be found `` within a reasonable time and manner.'' `` The phrase ` reasonable time and manner' is so vague as to fail to give the physician notice as to when his actions will violate the statute and subject him to criminal sanctions,'' the judge said. That violates the doctor's right to due process under the 14th Amendment, he said. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> said uncertainty about the law's meaning would lead doctors to protect themselves by denying abortions to minors who ca n't locate one of their parents `` The judge ruled on every single ground on which we alleged the law was unconstitutional,'' said <PERSON> Dara </PERSON> <PERSON> Klassel </PERSON>, attorney for Planned Parenthood. Two cases pending before the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> involve parental consent laws in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> abortion law generally requires doctors to notify a parent before performing an abortion on a young, unmarried girl. Passed by the state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> in 1985, the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> law never took effect due to a successful legal challenge by an <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION> abortion clinic and one of its doctors. The <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> law requires some girls to tell both parents at least 48 hours before having an abortion. A federal appeals court upheld the law, but postponed its ruling's effect while the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> reviewed it. According to court papers, parental notification or consent laws are in effect in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. A challenge to a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> parental consent law is under consideration by that state's <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Court Lifts Ban on Justice Department Drug Testing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court has lifted a ban on drug testing for <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> employees who have top-secret security clearances. However, the court Friday left intact a permanent injunction on random drug testing for <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers responsible for conducting grand jury proceedings and employees who prosecute criminal cases. The court suggested that the department consider limiting testing to personnel who handle drug prosecutions. Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said the department would consider seeking further court review of `` parts of the opinion with which we disagree'' or to refocus the program. The department's plans for random drug testing covered about 1,300 employees with top-secret clearances, as well as about 400 criminal prosecutors and 750 personnel with access to grand jury information. In a decision written by Chief U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Wald </PERSON>, the court rejected the department's request to lift the injunction issued by a federal district court last summer.

 A Roman Catholic priest who celebrated his last Mass as an inner-city pastor said he saw a new beginning in the merger of his church with another one closed by the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archdiocese </ORGANIZATION>. Rev. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> is losing his post at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agnes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> because it is merging with <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON>, a 300-member parish two miles away. <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Theresa </LOCATION> closed its doors Friday, the 17th church to shut down as part of the Archdiocese's plan to close 30 inner-city churches. <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> ended his 12-year pastoral duties at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> Agnes Friday amid tears of joy and sorrow from about 20 parishioners. Although he said he was sorry to leave, <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> said he was encouraged about the new start for the church, founded in 1914. `` Today's mass was a joyful occasion,'' said <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>, who will become a director at the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> at the nearby Sacred Heart Seminary. `` It is an ending and a new beginning for all.'' The new parish, as yet unnamed, will celebrate its first joint Mass Sunday. At least one parishioner was angry. `` I disagree strongly with the closings, and especially with the way it's being handled,'' said <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON>, a parishioner for 5 years. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> needs smaller bases such as this one to have a greater affect on the surrounding community.'' <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON> was among the throng of Catholics who packed a courtroom Wednesday when Circuit Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hathaway </PERSON> refused to block the closings.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' fever has subsided but doctors say they ca n't tell yet whether his condition has improved after an operation to remove his transplanted kidney. The former <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> president was being kept alive by daily dialysis treatments, which do the job of his failed kidneys and extract waste from the blood, <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiwanak </PERSON>, assistant administrator at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday. The operation was performed Thursday because doctors believed <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' life-threatening fever of up to 104 degrees was caused by his body's rejection of the donated kidney he received in 1984. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' temperature subsided to around 100 degrees, but he remained semicomatose and was unable to recognize people, <PERSON> Tiwanak </PERSON> said. `` The doctors feel it's too soon to say there has been an overall improvement in his condition as a result of the surgery,'' said <PERSON> Tiwanak </PERSON>. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was still in very critical condition and the prognosis remained poor, he said. Earlier, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Peyuan </PERSON> said three doctors told <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> her husband was slightly better following surgery. `` He's a little better. Just so-so. Still very critical,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> said as she left the hospital early Friday morning. But she was unresponsive to reporters when she returned to the hospital Friday night. When asked how her husband was doing, Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> said she was at the hospital to sign a release for <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' medication <PERSON> Tiwanak </PERSON> said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> could survive indefinitely with the use of a dialysis machine. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> also was hooked up to a resirator and other life-support equipment, <PERSON> Tiwanak </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> suffered liver failure Wednesday, and suffered heart, lung and kidney failure in May. He has remained in the hospital since being admitted Jan. 15. One of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' doctors, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the exiled leader's condition has generally worsened over the past five months. `` It's like a stair step,'' the doctor said. `` He gets worse, levels off, gets worse and levels offs, but sooner or later he'll fall off the steps. Another doctor, also speaking on the condition of anonymity, called <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' survival remarkable. `` He really does have a tremendous will to live,'' the doctor said. `` I can honestly say that just about any other person in his condition would have been dead months ago. There's no real explanation.'' The Marcoses were indicted in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> last year on federal racketeering charges. They stand accused of stealing more than $ 100 million from their homeland to buy art and real estate in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' illness has led him to be separated from the case. Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> is free on $ 5 million bail. The couple fled here in 1986 when a popular revolt swept <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> into the presidency. She has refused <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' many requests for permission to return home.

By automating the system, it greatly increases the access to all people.'' <PERSON> Chachra </PERSON>'s company, which is controlled by a non-profit arm of <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION>, announced last month that the Soviets had chosen its software system to automate their national library. <PERSON> Chachra </PERSON> will meet with the library's director, <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Semyonovich </PERSON> <PERSON> Kartashov </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Blacksburg </LOCATION> on July 18 to discuss the start of the project in November. The work is expected to take up to four years and cost $ 1 million, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION>, located just off <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, has 35 million books in 247 languages and 3,000 employees. Its 18 reading rooms, many of them with ornate, high ceilings and lit by chandeliers, seat more than 2,300 people and are visited by more than 7,000 readers each day. In comparison, the <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has 26 million books and the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> has 6 million books, <PERSON> Chachra </PERSON> said. The library was founded in 1862 as the <LOCATION> Rumiantsev </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Library </LOCATION>, named after a count whose collection accounted for most of its original holdings. It was renamed in 1925 after the father of the Russian revolution. In addition to <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>, famous Russians who have studied in the library include authors <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolstoy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fyodor </PERSON> <PERSON> Dostoyevsky </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chekhov </PERSON>. <PERSON> Chachra </PERSON> visited the library during a recent five-day trip to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` I was struck by the number of people waiting outside the door for the library to open,'' he said. `` There are n't that many libraries in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The users are dedicated.'' They have to be. Checking out a book is a lengthy and frustrating process, and just finding the right card catalog file is an ordeal because there are separate catalogs for various subcollections, <PERSON> Chachra </PERSON> said. After finding the right catalogue, the user must write the title and author on a slip of paper and stand in line for up to an hour to give the note to a circulation clerk. The clerk sends the note to the book retrieval area via pneumatic tubes. `` It can take anywhere from a half a day to five days to get a book,'' <PERSON> Chachra </PERSON> said. `` Occasionally, the book has been lent to someone else, and after waiting that long you find out you ca n't get it anyway.'' Under the planned automated system, people looking for a book will step up to a U.S.-made computer running on software designed by <PERSON> Chachra </PERSON> and his staff. For many, it will be their first experience with a personal computer, <PERSON> Chachra </PERSON> said. Users will be able to make a book request directly from a terminal and find out right away whether the book is checked out, <PERSON> Chachra </PERSON> said. The current system restricts access to information because of its cumbersome nature, <PERSON> Chachra </PERSON> said, but that will change. `` By the nature of the technology, it will be in favor of the user,'' he said. `` The software is designed for open access.'' <PERSON> Chachra </PERSON> said it remains to be seen whether <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> officials will give access to some books that are now off limits to users, presumably for political reasons. The <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> will be the first Soviet library to computerize, but it will be the sixth national library to automate with software from <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION>. The company has computerized the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gallery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, as well as libraries in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>. The company has computerized nearly 100 other libraries, including that of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>.

 <PERSON> Shen </PERSON> <PERSON> Tong </PERSON>, one of the student leaders being sought by <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities for their part in the pro-democracy movement, says he intends to carry on fighting for democratic reforms in exile. `` This movement for democracy has won a complete victory,'' said <PERSON> Shen </PERSON>, 20, who escaped <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and landed in this country June 11. `` It's a grand scale self-education of what democracy really is. ... The seeds of democracy have been sown.'' The lanky, self-assured fugitive, who is now studying biology at <ORGANIZATION> Brandeis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, broke a self-imposed silence Friday and gave an interview before holding a press conference in which he declared the Chinese student movement victorious. <PERSON> Shen </PERSON> was among five executive members of an organizing committee for the April 27 demonstration at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, where he was a student. The demonstration was staged in response to a critical editorial the previous day in The People's Daily. <PERSON> Shen </PERSON> was also a founder and leader of the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Area Colleges' Dialogue Delegation, which tried unsuccessfully to negotiate with Chinese Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> on May 18 on conditions for the students to leave the square they occupied for weeks until troops moved in He was about one mile from Tiananmen Square June 4, the day Chinese troops bore down with tanks and guns on the demonstrators. Although the protest focused on the square, the killing of thousands occurred throughout the streets of the city, <PERSON> Shen </PERSON> said. Men standing beside him were shot dead, one man through the head. He saw tanks bearing down on an angry, disbelieving throng. `` <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> people were very brave,'' <PERSON> Shen </PERSON> said. `` They did n't leave the street but walked around the bodies and in front of the soldiers All of the soldiers were crazy, shooting people.'' <PERSON> Shen </PERSON> escaped <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> under circumstances he refused to reveal. Several other leaders of the democracy movement escaped, including <LOCATION> Wu'er </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kaixi </LOCATION>, a top student leader; <PERSON> Yan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiaqi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Su </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaozhi </PERSON>, leading dissident intellectuals; and <PERSON> Wan </PERSON> <PERSON> Runnan </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s first private high tech company, <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Shen </PERSON> had already won a place as a Wien scholar at <LOCATION> Brandeis </LOCATION> before the massacre During the interview Friday, he wore a blood red T-shirt bearing the black outline of the Goddess of Democracy, the plastic likeness of the Statue of Liberty the student demonstrators erected in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shen </PERSON> said he intends to continue to work for the democratic reform of his homeland. `` We have to try our best,'' <PERSON> Shen </PERSON> said. `` This movement is still a movement.''

 A chartered bus clipped the rear of a tractor-trailer and overturned, injuring 42 passengers, police said. The bus, taking a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> church group to <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, hit the truck Friday afternoon while trying to pass on Interstate 85, said state Trooper <PERSON> D.W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ezell </PERSON>. The bus crossed the lane, went off the shoulder and flipped on its side. `` It was scary,'' said passenger <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON>, 16. `` We hit the truck and the bus rocked this way, and that way, and then, bam, we were over the side.'' <PERSON> Ezell </PERSON> said the bus driver, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Bookhart </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bloomfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, was charged with reckless driving. The bus, which had 47 people aboard, was traveling at 65 mph when it hit the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Van </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> truck, the trooper said. The accident occurred one day before the state raised the speed limit for buses on rural interstates from 55 mph to 65 mph. A side of the bus was ripped open, and clothes and other personal belongings were strewn along the highway. The interstate was closed for about 3 -LCB- hours after the accident, which occurred about 50 miles south of <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>. All of the injured were taken to Community Memorial Hospital in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, said hospital administrator <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Faulkner </PERSON>. <PERSON> Faulkner </PERSON> said one person was admitted to Community Memorial for observation and three were transferred to the <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> for treatment of broken bones.

<TEXT>
 Tiananmen Square re-opened to the public today, almost four weeks after army tanks stormed the grounds in a violent suppression of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s pro-democracy movement. Hundreds of people who had obtained special permission filed through the vast square in orderly lines, peering first at the Forbidden City's Gate of Heavenly Peace and then at the few soldiers who patroled the square. Eight police guards with new weapons meanwhile stood around the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> as diplomats and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens took part in an annual Fourth of July party. The eight with submachine guns were <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> regularly assigned to the embassy, a diplomat inside the compound said. `` Same guys, different guns,'' said the diplomat, who spoke on condition he not be identified by name. <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> officers with pistols normally stand guard at foreign embassies. It was not immediately clear why these guards were re-armed. The appearance of guards carrying more powerful weapons sparked some fears because of strained relations in recent weeks between <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> over the military crackdown and the status of a leading Chinese dissident, astrophysicist <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON>, who has taken refuge at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mission. Elsewhere, hundreds of cheerful tourists gathered on the rostrum above the Gate of Heavenly Peace, where <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON> declared the founding of the People's Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on Oct. 1, 1949. There was no sign of the terror and grief that engulfed <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> June 3-4, when the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> stormed the square, shooting its way through hundreds of thousands of unarmed protesters. The government says about 300 people were killed, half of them soldiers. Chinese witnesses and Western diplomats say the deaths were in the thousands. Foreign tourists today paid 30 yuan -LRB- $ 8.10 -RRB- while Chinese paid $ 2.70, two days' wages for many workers, to stand atop the gate. Visitors from <LOCATION> Liaoning </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Shandong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hubei </LOCATION> provinces snapped away with their cameras. Most said they had not heard of the deaths during the military crackdown. Some crowded to get an autograph of <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuyi </PERSON>, one of the martial law commanders who brought troops to quell what the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government has called a `` counterrevolutionary rebellion'' last month. Others jostled each other to seek an autograph of <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> <PERSON> Baifa </PERSON>, vice mayor of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Groups of a dozen soldiers with AK-47 rifles marched by the gate every minute. <PERSON> Tiananmen </PERSON> opened a day after former <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> was stripped of his last government title. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, ousted as party general secretary a week ago, was dismissed by senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> as vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> is chairman of the commission. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, a moderate, was effectively ousted more than a month ago, after he paid a tearful visit on May 19 to students on a hunger strike in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION>. He has not been seen since. President <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shangkun </PERSON>, who spent his career in the military, reportedly was seeking to replace <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> on the commission. The commission's senior vice chairman is second to <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> in the government's military command.

<HEAD>State Elections in Michoacan to Test Mexico's Governing Party</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The ruling <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and its leftist opposition face an unusual test Sunday _ whether the <LOCATION> Michoacan </LOCATION> state legislative elections will be clean. The pre-election rhetoric has been harsh as both sides have poured money and energy into the race in this western <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> farming state. The governing party, known by its Spanish initials <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>, has been in power in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> for 60 years and has often been accused of winning elections through fraud. The leftist <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, founded earlier this year by native son <PERSON> Cuauhtemoc </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>, has been saying Sunday's balloting will likely be rife with vote-tampering `` The <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> and fraud are synonymous,'' Democratic Revolutionary Sen. <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Robles </PERSON> <PERSON> Garnica </PERSON> told a news conference Friday. The state <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, controlled by <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>, has called out the army to guard the polls. <PERSON> Robles </PERSON> and other Democratic Revolutionary leaders said the move is an attempt to intimidate voters by `` fabricating a specter of violence.'' However, top <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> officials say there may indeed be violence and call the troop deployment a preventive measure. `` This is n't a ghost; it's reality,'' one of them, <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> <PERSON> Viedas </PERSON>, said in an interview. In addition, legislative elections will be held Sunday in <LOCATION> Zacatecas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chihuahua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Campeche </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> state, which will also elect a governor and mayors. Fair balloting is also at issue in the other states. Much attention has focused on <LOCATION> Michoacan </LOCATION>, which is seen as a key contest. In the last election in 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> won 18 of 24 seats in <LOCATION> Michoacan </LOCATION>'s single-house legislature, and four small opposition parties took the rest. But in July last year, <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> polled 64 percent of <LOCATION> Michoacan </LOCATION>'s vote in the presidential election, and his coalition's candidates took both <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seats and 12 of the state's 13 national Chamber of Deputies from the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> Although <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> came in second behind President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> nationwide, it was a stunning blow for the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> in the state. In addition, <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> supporters mounted sit-ins last December at about half the state's 113 city and town halls to demand the ouster of Gov. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> Villacana </PERSON>. They accused him of corruption. The protests prompted him to quit and take a job as director of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toll </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bridges </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. Several <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> mayors also resigned. The new governor, <PERSON> Genovevo </PERSON> <PERSON> Figuero </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamudio </PERSON>, issued a statement Friday promising `` honest, free, clean and safe'' elections. He said the party had overhauled its leadership and image. As part of that new image, the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> for the first time put forward candidates in open convention. However, they were then nominated by party leaders behind closed doors. Despite <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts, opposition representatives are still complaining of purported irregularities in voter registration rolls and screening of poll watchers. The conservative <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, weaker in this state, is also fielding candidates. About 1.5 million voters are expected to cast ballots at 2,330 polling stations in this state from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sunday. Official results are expected a week later.

 Federal investigators are probing allegations that a development agency used federal housing funds to finance campaigns of local <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> officials, a newspaper reported. At least five federal investigators Thursday night searched the home of <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Madrack </PERSON>, chief operating officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Camden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and seized 34 boxes of records, The <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inquirer </ORGANIZATION> reported in today's editions. The now-disbanded corporation was a non-profit agency that processed federal housing money from 1983 to 1986. Hours after subpoenas were issued Friday in the probe, Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, called for a speedy investigation and suggested Republicans initiated the inquiry for political purposes. <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> is <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>'s political base and the agency under investigation was run by <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders with ties to <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>. <PERSON> Madrack </PERSON> spent seven years on <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>'s staff. County Freeholder <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> DiPiero </PERSON>, a Republican, prompted the investigation by writing <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Inspector General <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> and alleging widespread abuse of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> funds and criminal activity at the agency, the Inquirer reported. Investigators said <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> was not a target of the investigation and there was no evidence of his personal involvement, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in today's editions. The investigators said <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>'s political organization in <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and a number of his associates are under scrutiny, the newspaper said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> said his office is probing various <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> matters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, but would not comment. <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> said he received a telephone call Friday evening from <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> confirming the Camden probe, but said there were no individual targets. The investigation comes as a congressional panel is looking into possible influence peddling and misuse of funds at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> by prominent Republicans during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. <PERSON> DiPiero </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, a former employee of the development agency, told investigators at least $ 30,000 in federal money may have been diverted to Democratic campaigns, the Inquirer reported, citing unidentified officials familiar with the probe. <PERSON> DiPiero </PERSON> also told investigators some <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> money was used by agency employees to buy cocaine, the Inquirer reported. The Times said investigators were probing allegations that money was diverted to Democratic campaigns and used for personal reasons, including vacations. <PERSON> Madrack </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON>, said his client was told he is not a target of the investigation. The documents were in his home because he is their legal custodian, he said. <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> noted the disclosure of the <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION> investigation followed by days the resignations of two top advisers to the Republican nominee for governor, Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Courter </PERSON>, because of their ties to the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> scandal. The two events `` are so coincidental ... that I can not help but wonder if there are political motivations involved in the leaks,'' <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> said. He demanded federal officials determine how news of the investigation was leaked. Political strategist <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> stepped down from the <PERSON> Courter </PERSON> campaign earlier this week after a partner in his firm, <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Manafort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, acknowledged the firm received more than $ 300,000 to obtain nearly $ 31 million in <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> funds for a <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> housing project that was opposed by local officials. Media analyst <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, who also resigned, has said he made a telephone call to connect Stone's firm with state housing officials. <PERSON> Courter </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hensley </PERSON> said the campaign was not involved in starting the <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION> investigation.

 Hundreds of vacationers on a trip from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> endured hours of delay, a malfunction that forced their plane to dump its fuel, an unscheduled stop and a fire on their bus. Hot under the collar, 53 of them finally just said `` no'' and refused to head for home Friday night on the same chartered plane that spilled its fuel into the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> earlier this week. `` I value my life more than I want to get on that plane,'' said <PERSON> Joanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris-Brown </PERSON>, a travel consultant from <LOCATION> Liberpool </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. She was among 480 passengers on the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 that dumped fuel en route back to <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, and landed Thursday night at the <ORGANIZATION> Edmonton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> after a loss of oil pressure in the engines. On their way to the flight home Friday night, their bus caught fire. A passing fire truck put out the blaze, which was blamed on a leak of power-steering fluid. The mishap was another in a series of incidents and inconveniences to plague the passengers from the moment they began their trip two weeks ago. Before leaving <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, they were delayed more than an hour. They waited 16 hours to board in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> on the return flight. After the oil pressure problem forced the plane down, the passengers once again waited five hours because they were told customs officials had not arrived. Many were openly hostile when a representative for the British consulate broke the news Friday night they would be leaving on the same plane. `` It's been repaired four times by competent engineers, and it's still not working,'' claimed passenger <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> `` I'm frightened to take my 1-year-old son on the plane,'' he said. `` We're going over the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> next; that's what frightens me.'' The plane was scheduled to leave today with those passengers willing to board.

<TEXT>
 The humble mussel, a tidal water delicacy, is now playing a pivotal role in monitoring pollution in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. Spread over 15 locations along the Dutch coast, 1,500 of the jet-black mollusks were put into service this week as a way scientists can check the flow of poisonous waste through the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, one of the most heavily polluted basins in the world, a project spokesman said Friday. In filtering algae from sea water for food, the bivalves also store poisonous waste and heavy metals. A look at what they have stored gives a picture of the quality of water they live in. `` They give us a perfect overview of the water quality over the time span involved,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scholten </PERSON>, a spokesman for the government project. The mussels live in plastic baskets attached to shipping buoys up to six miles off the coast. They will be checked in three six-week periods over a year at a cost of $ 113,600. `` Mussels are ideal for this kind of job because they filter so much water,'' <PERSON> Scholten </PERSON> said. The average mussel processes about 13 gallons of sea water a day, he said.

<HEAD>Puerto Rican Nationalist Says Flag Decision Should Erase His Conviction</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A jailed Puerto Rican nationalist has filed a petition for freedom under a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision he claims condones his burning of an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag two years ago. In what may be the first direct result of last week's court decision, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendoza-Lugo </PERSON>, an inmate at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> penitentiary in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, filed a petition in federal court Friday demanding the government show cause for keeping him in prison. Mendoza-Lugo burned a flag in front of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> post office in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> in 1987, as a protest for Puerto Rican independence. `` It was n't an act of vandalism; I was protesting,'' said <PERSON> Mendoza-Lugo </PERSON>, 36. `` It's unconstitutional for me to be in jail when I was making use of my freedom of speech.'' A lawyer in the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> case said <PERSON> Mendoza-Lugo </PERSON> was the first jailed flag-burner to seek freedom since the high court issued the June 21 decision. `` This guy should not be in jail any longer if that's -LRB- flag burning -RRB- the basis for his conviction,'' said lawyer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, who represented flag-burner <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> vs. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> case. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled in favor of <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, saying the Constitution's guarantee of free speech protects people who burn the flag as a form of political protest. In response to the ruling, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> this week began pressing for a constitutional amendment prohibiting desecration of the American flag. The number of people in jail for flag-burning is so small that the federal <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION> does n't keep statistics on it. Mendoza-Lugo pleaded guilty to flag desecration and began serving a maximum one-year sentence last December. A staff member for the Puerto Rican magistrate handling the case said <PERSON> Mendoza-Lugo </PERSON>'s sentence was shortened recently to seven months, making him eligible for release this month

<TEXT>
 Police arrested more than 200 people on drug, weapons and other charges in the year's first sweep of gang-infested areas, and they promised to keep up the pressure over the holiday weekend. The latest dragnet `` is to let the gang members know they are not going to control the streets,'' said police Lt. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Tatreau </PERSON>, who organized the eight-hour sweep that ended early today. Some 235 people, 136 of them reputed gang members, were arrested during the sweep of the city's south side, said <PERSON> Teri </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, a police analyst who recorded the arrests. The number far exceeded the 150 that <PERSON> Tatreau </PERSON> had projected. `` We expect tomorrow night to be even a little busier,'' Ms. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said. `` We'll see.'' Forty-nine arrests were for felony narcotics violations and two were for misdemeanor narcotics violations. Other arrests involved such things as weapons charges, outstanding felony warrants and driving under the influence, Ms. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said. Portable booking trailers were set up at the Police Department's Southeast Division station in the heart of the impoverished <LOCATION> Watts </LOCATION> district, the site of deadly riots in 1965 The effort represented the first massive dragnet aimed at drug-dealing street thugs since last summer's highly publicized `` Hammer'' sweeps, which also targeted the city's drug - and gang-infested south side The sweeps will resume again this evening and continue through the holiday weekend, with police shifting their focus west toward beach communities as the weekend progresses, officials said. `` Nice people will be going to the beach. We're trying to keep the dirt bags away,'' said Detective <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Celli </PERSON>. Despite last year's sweeps, the number of gang-related slayings increased to 452 in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> last year from 387 in 1987.

 The tanker that spilled 420,000 gallons of heating oil into <LOCATION> Narragansett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> was released for repairs and the ship's Greek captain was freed on $ 50,000 bail. Earlier Friday, a helmsman aboard the tanker told a federal inquiry board he saw a warning buoy on the wrong side of the ship before it ran aground, but he did n't warn the captain. The ship's chief mate praised the captain as one of the best to work for and apologized for the spill, which scientists said caused less environmental damage than first feared. Meanwhile, officials in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> prepared to lift a state of emergency on the oil-soiled <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, where a tanker spilled an estimated 300,000 gallons of heating oil after running aground last weekend. In <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, Federal Magistrate <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagopian </PERSON> late Friday released the World Prodigy. <PERSON> Hagopian </PERSON> said his order would contain a provision that the ship be towed. Lt. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> expected to release the ship today to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shipyard </LOCATION>, which runs a yard in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Divers discovered the ship had a gash on either side, extending as long as 200 feet down the 560-foot vessel. The magistrate also freed Captain <PERSON> Iakovos </PERSON> <PERSON> Georgudis </PERSON>, 43, after the ship's owners wired $ 50,000 bail. <PERSON> Georgudis </PERSON> had been confined aboard the ship and faces two misdemeanor charges he violated pollution laws. Helmsman <PERSON> Konstadinos </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paraskevopulos </PERSON>, speaking through an interpreter, said he saw the red buoy marking the reef `` a little to the left'' as the tanker headed into the harbor. Warning buoys should be kept on the right for ships entering a harbor, but <PERSON> Paraskevopulos </PERSON> said nothing about warning the captain. Given the discipline on board the ship, `` The helmsman would n't dare make any suggestion to the master,'' Coast Guard Capt <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitten </PERSON> said. Human error was `` a pretty good conclusion,'' said <PERSON> Whitten </PERSON>, who ran the board of inquiry with two <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> investigators. <PERSON> Whitten </PERSON> said it would be six months before he finished a final report, and <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> investigators said theirs could take as long as nine months. <PERSON> Whitten </PERSON> said the biggest gap was lack of testimony from the captain. Testimony at the hearing showed that harbor pilots often board ships well past the point where state law requires them to board. The chief mate, <PERSON> Georgios </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlahos </PERSON>, showed investigators a symbol on a British chart that corresponded to a pick-up point for harbor pilots that was inside the line set by the state. The World Prodigy was well inside that line and had no pilot on board when it grounded. <PERSON> Vlahos </PERSON> also apologized for the accident. `` I am very sorry for this happening. I do n't know what else to say. I think it was a very bad time and all else is in your hands,'' he told the board. <PERSON> Paraskevopulos </PERSON> said the captain was tied up with radio traffic to the harbor pilot just before the grounding. The two men testified under federal immunity. <PERSON> Vlahos </PERSON> also testified before a grand jury investigating possible violations of the state's harbor pilot and pollution laws. State, federal and <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rhode </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> scientists said there apparently had been little permanent environmental damage. About 150 young lobsters, 500 crabs, 15 birds and numerous mussels have died, they said, but most small animals critical to the food chain, such as zooplankton, survived. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, the tanker <PERSON> Presidente </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> leaked up to 1,500 barrels more oil while being cleaned and emptied, but officials said most of the oil was mopped up with a boom and a skimmer. Officials anticipated lifting the emergency status from the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> over the weekend.

The officials denied the cancellation was a response to a federal inquiry into HUD-sponsored projects on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, the newspaper said. Island Park was awarded the funds for the pool last year after Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, a village resident, personally lobbied then-HUD Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 The post-traumatic stress defense used by some wives accused of killing their husbands also can apply to juveniles, a judge ruled in finding a teenage girl innocent of killing her abusive father. Attorneys agreed the case set a legal precedent, but 15-year-old <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodykoontz </PERSON> said she was surprised a judge rejected the prosecution's claim that she committed murder because she was influenced by heavy-metal rock' n' roll music. `` I thought they were going to do something to me, anyway,'cause ... I like the music,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Goodykoontz </PERSON>. `` It's not fair to judge somebody just because of what they listen to.'' Circuit Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuder </PERSON> on Friday ruled that the teen-ager acted in self defense when she shot her father, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Chief Petty Officer <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodykoontz </PERSON>, in the family's <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> home. The judge said Ms. <PERSON> Goodykoontz </PERSON> suffered from battered-child syndrome, similar to the disorder that afflicts battle-shocked veterans and wives who have been abused by their husbands. She had a reasonable belief she was in danger although her father took no overt physical action just before he was shot with his own handgun, <PERSON> Kuder </PERSON> said. `` I'm unaware of any decision by a judge that's set this precedent in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>,'' said Assistant Public Defender <PERSON> Elton </PERSON> <PERSON> Killam </PERSON>, who represented Ms. <PERSON> Goodykoontz </PERSON>. His co-counsel, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Mones </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> who is writing a book about abused children slaying their parents, said he knew of no other similar decision by a juvenile court in a non-jury trial, but he said juvenile court decisions are n't always publicized. <PERSON> Kuder </PERSON> also said the state failed to prove any connection between heavy-metal music and the July 23 shooting. He took nearly two months to review the case. During a four-day, non-jury trial that ended May 4, Ms. <PERSON> Goodykoontz </PERSON> testified her father had made sexual overtures and she was afraid he was going to rape her. The judge also heard testimony that the father had a history of violence against his wife and three children, including a threat to kill the entire family on the day he died.

 A judge's decision to award custody of an orphaned toddler to his mother's longtime female companion angered the boy's blood relatives, who also had sought custody. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellemare </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Duxbury </LOCATION> was granted temporary custody of 15-month-old <PERSON> Collin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> by a <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> probate judge Friday. <PERSON> Bellemare </PERSON> was named the boy's guardian in a will left by <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, the child's mother who died in a car accident in May. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>'s parents are challenging the will, claiming they or <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON>, would be a better guardian. `` This other <PERSON> Susan </PERSON>, she is not even blood,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Susan </PERSON>'s brother, who attended the hearing along with his parents and sister. `` I have been co-parenting <PERSON> Collin </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Bellemare </PERSON>, 33, told Judge <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cain </PERSON> during the hearing. `` I would parent the child, I would love him, nurture him.'' No one involved in the case would characterize the relationship between the two women, who reportedly exchanged wedding rings. They were companions for a dozen years, owned a home together and lived together while raising the baby. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> conceived her son by artificial insemination. `` We're not trying to cast aspersions on anybody,'' said <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Monaghan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the lawyer for the grandparents. `` The person forgotten in this proceeding is the child and what is in the best interests of the child.'' The boy, dressed in blue denim overalls and placated with cheese snacks by his grandmother and aunt, was in the courtroom for most of the hearing. <PERSON> Elsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, the boy's grandmother, quit her job as a legal secretary to take care of the child after the car accident that also injured <PERSON> Bellemare </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bellemare </PERSON> told the judge she had unsuccessfully tried to see the boy at his grandparents' home, but had been prevented from doing so. <PERSON> Cain </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Bellemare </PERSON> about her health and ability to raise the child on her own. <PERSON> Bellemare </PERSON>, who used a cane to walk to the witness stand, said she saw a doctor two weeks ago and was told `` to get on with my life. `` I'm back at work, I'm driving. I'm back at home and able to provide for the child,'' she said, adding that the boy would be tended while she worked by the same woman who has cared for him since he was an infant. In giving <PERSON> Bellemare </PERSON> temporary custody, <PERSON> Cain </PERSON> also allowed the grandparents visitation rights. Attorneys representing he boy's grandparents would not say whether they planned to appeal the temporary custody order to a higher court. Another hearing was set for August to determine whether <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>'s will is valid.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> started his long holiday weekend with a brisk morning jog today, saying he had no official meetings scheduled during the vacation but added, `` You know me, I get restless.'' He said he had a pile of briefing papers to review for his upcoming summit trip to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, which begins July 9 in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> was with him for the five-day stay in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>. When asked by a reporter who ran with him if he planned to fly in any other officials, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he had no specific plans to do so. `` But you know me,'' he added, `` I get restless.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was joined on his early morning run by his daughter, <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBlond </PERSON>, and the first dog, <PERSON> Millie </PERSON>. Regarding the first family's well-publicized objections this week to Washingtonian magazine's characterization of <PERSON> Millie </PERSON> as the ugliest dog in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the president said he at first thought magazine editors were joking when he received an apologetic note from them on Friday. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he wrote a note back and brushed the whole matter off. He had already sent the publication a photograph of himself with <PERSON> Millie </PERSON> and her newborn puppies, he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ran for about two miles on dirt roads near his family's <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>'s Point compound He greeted a few neighbors who were out. `` Beautiful day,'' he called out as he passed. He also advised them not to miss the Fourth of July fireworks that are to be set off on Monday night, July 3, over <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>'s Point. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he does not know all the neighbors and remarked on how many houses had been built in the rustic area since he was a boy, when there were no houses in the beachfront neighborhood where he ran. After his run, he headed off to the sauna and said he was going for a swim in the pool, then boating later in the day. On Friday night he went out fishing on his boat but had no luck, he said. His daughter said that was because he steered the boat into the reeds where her fishing line got caught. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> arrived in this resort town Friday afternoon after wrapping up a day in which he announced his proposed language for a constitutional amendment against desecration of the American flag, spoke at a commemoration of the 25th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act, and met with South African anti-apartheid activist <PERSON> Albertina </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will remain in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION> until early Wednesday. He has no public events scheduled, but plans to view the Fourth of July fireworks display. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will be back at the White House for only a few days next week before leaving for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> on July 9, visiting <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as a prelude to the economic summit of major <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> industrialized nations in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. In an Independence Day message to the nation released by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Friday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asked `` all Americans to remember the precious legacy of liberty we enjoy.'' <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION> was bustling with vacationers as the president arrived, most of them strolling around the main town square where boutiques and curio shops abound. A fairly steady stream of cars drove slowly past the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> checkpoints on the narrow coastal road that passes <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s home. Press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the traveling White House was prepared to comment on the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s scheduled decision Monday on a landmark abortion case. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> began the Independence Day weekend with a flag-draped event Friday at the Iwo Jima Memorial of Marines raising the flag during World War II, where the president pushed for a constitutional amendment to allow laws against burning the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled June 21 that the Constitution's freedom-of-speech guarantees protect people who burn the flag as a form of political protest. The amendment crafted by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and Republican congressional leaders reads: `` The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the states shall have power to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' Critics have said such an amendment would open the door for erosion of the First Amendment to the Constitution. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` This amendment preserves the widest conceivable range of options for free expression.''

<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> intelligence analyst who killed himself after defecting to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had missed his homeland and was irritated by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s chronic shortages of consumer goods, Pravda said today. But <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Souther </PERSON> still asked to be buried in his <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> officer's uniform, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily said. The newspaper described the 32-year-old <PERSON> Souther </PERSON>, who committed suicide in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on June 22, as a top Soviet spy. It said he had access to `` the most valuable documents on the top-secret plans for use of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> in a nuclear war against the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and other socialist countries. `` He belonged with such outstanding soldiers of the ` invisible front' as <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Blake </PERSON>,'' Pravda said, naming two famous British intelligence service operatives who spied for the Soviets. The article did not say how <PERSON> Souther </PERSON> died, but it said colleagues had noticed his occasional bouts of depression but never thought it could lead to suicide. The <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> chief, Gen. <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kryuchko </PERSON>, said on Wednesday that <PERSON> Souther </PERSON> committed suicide. <PERSON> Souther </PERSON> defected in 1986 when the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> began investigating him. At the time, the <LOCATION> Hammond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, native was working as a satellite photo analyst in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s 2nd Fleet headquarters in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. Pravda indicated <PERSON> Souther </PERSON> fled his native land `` with pain in his heart'' only because he feared the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation `` Of course, not everything <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> met in the Soviet land was as he had expected,'' the newspaper said. `` For example, he could never comprehend that it is possible to drop into a store and be unable to find some needed item.'' The article also quoted a letter <PERSON> Souther </PERSON> left to his colleagues at the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>, where he was given the rank of major last year. `` Justice demands that you hear my last words. I do not regret our relationship. It was a longstanding one, and helped me grow as a person. I wish to be buried in the uniform of an officer of the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>.'' The article did not say whether authorities complied with that request, but <PERSON> Kryuchkov </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Souther </PERSON> was given a military funeral on Monday and he was buried in the same section of <LOCATION> Kuntsevo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cemetary </LOCATION> as <PERSON> Philby </PERSON>. Pravda said he took the name <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Orlov </PERSON> after his arrival in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, choosing the Russian word for `` eagles'' for his last name because it symbolized freedom and strength.

<TEXT>
 Angolan rebels today denied government claims that they had violated a week-old truce in country's civil war. In a statement released in <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>, the guerrillas affirmed their `` total engagement in the process of peace and national reconciliation.'' The Angolan government broke off peace negotiations on Friday, accusing the rebels of violating a June 24 cease-fire by cutting power lines to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s capital, <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION>, and ambushing convoys of civilian vehicles. The guerrillas belong to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and have fought to force the government to share power since shortly after <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> gained independence from <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> in 1975. Rebel leader <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> and Angolan President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> signed the cease-fire on June 22 in <LOCATION> Gbadolite </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>, and peace talks began on Wednesday in <LOCATION> Kinshasa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>. The Portuguese state-run RTP network reported Friday that <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> ordered his delegation home and said it would not return until the rebels explained the alleged cease-fire violations. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s state news agency <ORGANIZATION> ANGOP </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that five people died Thursday when <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas ambushed a convoy transporting coffee in <LOCATION> Cuanza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> province. The guerrillas' statement said cease-fire instructions may be taking time to reach all combat units in the field around <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, a country twice the size of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> news agency <ORGANIZATION> Lusa </ORGANIZATION> on Friday quoted an unidentified rebel official as saying power lines from the Cambambe dam's hydroelectric station were downed Thursday when a cow set off a land mine protecting high-voltage pylons A rebel statement on Friday, meanwhile, rejected government proposals for special treatment for <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> during a national reconciliation process agreed on at <LOCATION> Gbadolite </LOCATION>. The statement said the government was trying to divide the rebel movement. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>'s future was left unclear by the <LOCATION> Gbadolite </LOCATION> declaration, which called for reintegration of rebels into Angolan society. The rebel leader has agreed to sit out of Angolan politics for two years before running in free elections against <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>' Popular Movement for the Liberation of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>

 President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> has agreed to release an American photographer captured while traveling with Moslem guerrillas, <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> officials said today. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> gave assurances during a meeting Friday with <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalid </PERSON>, special envoy for <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, that <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> would be freed, said the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` It is not clear if Mr. <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> will go through the legal formalities before he gets the presidential pardon or will be released after the trial formalities are over,'' said one official. `` It is certain that Mr. <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> will see his freedom in the coming weeks, but I am unable to say exactly when,'' he said. <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, who did not have a visa to enter <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, was arrested by security forces on June 8 at a rebel hideout in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. He has not been formally charged. The 43-year-old native of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, had been covering the civil war between <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s Marxist government and the guerrillas. He was on assignment for <ORGANIZATION> Time-Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>.

 Socialist <PERSON> Asae </PERSON> <PERSON> Uemura </PERSON>, a divorced mother of two trying to beat male incumbents and the party that has ruled <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for decades, seems to have everything going for her politically. Until recently, a candidate like Ms. <PERSON> Uemura </PERSON> would not have generated much optimism. But a series of scandals and an unpopular new tax have played into the hands of opposition office-seekers. Public opinion polls paint a dismal picture for the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in an election Sunday for the 128 <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> seats. With 9 million eligible voters, <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> is being watched closely as an indicator of what could lie ahead for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s governing party since it was formed in 1954. Nationwide elections for half the upper house of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> are scheduled July 23. Only 25 percent of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> voters polled by the <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said they plan to support <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidates, down from 34 percent who expressed support before the last such elections were held in 1985. A <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> poll released Thursday showed 16 percent supporting the Socialists, the top national opposition party, while support for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> had fallen from 42.4 to only 13.2 percent. The increased chances for women may come from voters' anger over a sex scandal involving Prime Minister <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>, who allegedly has kept several paid mistresses. Requests for Uno to give speeches for the party's municipal candidates have dropped off. At one rally he attended, governing party supporters scuffled with women carrying placards that said: `` We do n't need a prostitution premier.'' Senior party officials are considering replacing <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> after the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> polling if the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> lose badly because a loss in the upper house election then `` will be obvious due to <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>'s womanizing scandal,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Mainichi </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said `` The Uno Cabinet now seems virtually dead,'' it said in an editorial. Campaigning a few days before the election, Ms. <PERSON> Uemura </PERSON> rode through the streets of <ORGANIZATION> Minato </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ward </ORGANIZATION> in a van, waving and asking passers-by for support. Like all candidates, Ms. <PERSON> Uemura </PERSON> wore white gloves and a large carnation in her lapel. She said she spends 12 hours campaigning each day. `` The ant has brought down the elephant,'' Ms. <PERSON> Uemura </PERSON> said, referring to the upset victory of a female Socialist in a parliamentary by-election on Sunday in a traditionally conservative area in northern <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. In the back of the van, two attractive young women _ what Japanese campaign managers call `` warbler girls'' _ waved and smiled. One of them, <PERSON> Yukari </PERSON> <PERSON> Hibiya </PERSON>, said she was motivated by the $ 177-a-day pay, not strong political convictions. `` But I would n't have accepted this kind of work from the <ORGANIZATION> LDP </ORGANIZATION>, since they're behind the tax,'' she said. The Liberal Democrats forced a 3 percent sales tax through Parliament in December despite an opposition boycott. The sales tax, part of a controversial tax change, took effect April 1. Alarmed by the losses at the polls and reeling from the Recruit influence-buying scandal that brought down <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>'s predecessor, <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> has pledged to clean up its image. `` As head of the party, I'd like to devote myself entirely to the party and political reforms,'' <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> said after he became prime minister June 2. <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> was chosen to head the party because he is one of the few senior <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> untainted by Recruit, a publishing conglomerate accused of doling out millions of dollars in political donations and underpriced stocks in exchange for favors. Among the reforms announced by the Liberal Democrats are dissolution of party factions, which create power blocs but force leaders to raise huge sums of money to support their followers' political activities Nearly all <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers belong to one of six factions. Critics say the governing party is not serious about change. `` Their plans are full of loopholes,'' said <PERSON> Satsuki </PERSON> <PERSON> Eda </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, the fifth-largest bloc in Parliament. <PERSON> Eda </PERSON> said self-restraint is needed, not legislation. `` They do n't need to spend so much money,'' <PERSON> Eda </PERSON> said. `` I do n't spend so much, but I survive elections.

 A man who watched a co-worker leap out a sixth-floor window as smoke filled a burning office building said he almost followed her, but kept his poise and helped four others escape by ladder. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackman </PERSON> smashed open a window to allow the group to breathe while they waited for rescue, but one of them panicked and jumped, and was in critical condition early today. Four other people were killed. `` I was n't calm. I was scared to death. I think I said, ` We're going to die,''' <PERSON> Blackman </PERSON> said The blaze Friday at the 10-story <PERSON> Peachtree </PERSON> 25th Building also left more than 20 people hospitalized, including five firefighters. Officials said rescuers were hampered by panicking office workers. `` My understanding is that some firefighters could have saved or helped more people if they did n't panic. But some people did panic,'' said <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for Mayor <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. The woman who jumped from the window, identified as <PERSON> Cassandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayward </PERSON>, 20, broke both legs and an ankle and underwent surgery Friday night at <ORGANIZATION> Piedmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, a spokesman said. Authorities said the fire started about 10:30 a.m. with an explosion at an electrical panel on the sixth floor of the dark-tinted glass building, where workers were repairing a fuse. Authorities said they did not know what caused the explosion and fire, which later spread two floors below and one above. `` It's simple speculation, but it may have been a short,'' said Acting Fire Chief <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Perrin </PERSON>. The blast killed a maintenance worker who was thrown several feet, and melted aluminum near the panel, <PERSON> Perrin </PERSON> said. Names of the maintenance worker and the other three dead, one of whom was a woman, were not released by authorities, but the family of graphics artist <PERSON> Clifton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON>, 29, confirmed that he was one of those killed. Sgt. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> medical examiner's office said this morning that reports of a fifth death stemmed from an error in his office. Another, unrelated death occurred about the time of the fire and for a time was mistakenly included in the fire toll, he said. <PERSON> Blackman </PERSON>, 30, said he heard a series of loud pops from an electrical panel outside the door of his office suite. `` It hit me real quick that we were in real bad trouble,'' <PERSON> Blackman </PERSON> said. `` It went from, ` Oh, my God, something really bad has happened to the guy working on the fuse box,' to ` Oh, my God, something bad is happening to all of us.' `` I went running out there. The maintenance guy was out there, screaming for help,'' <PERSON> Blackman </PERSON> said. `` We could n't get to him.'' <PERSON> Blackman </PERSON> and five other workers from the private Bureau of Wholesale Sales Representatives, including <PERSON> Hayward </PERSON>, fled back into his office, where smoke began making it difficult to breathe. <PERSON> Blackman </PERSON> threw a chair through a window, and a few minutes later <PERSON> Hayward </PERSON> jumped. `` She went right by me,'' <PERSON> Blackman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Blackman </PERSON>, who was hospitalized in good condition with smoke inhalation and cuts, said he led the other workers one by one to the 5-foot-wide window for breaths of air until firefighters could reach the window with a ladder. Then <PERSON> Blackman </PERSON> helped the others out. `` It probably was n't more than five or 10 minutes. It seemed like about 30 years,'' <PERSON> Blackman </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from the hospital. <PERSON> Perrin </PERSON> said the fire was severe because the building has no sprinkler system. It was built in 1962, before sprinklers were required. About 200 people, many of them rescued office workers with soot-blackened clothing and skin, gathered on the street outside the building as firefighters battled the blaze. Some sat down, breathing from oxygen masks. <PERSON> Darlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, 57, said she was one of eight people in a sixth-floor office when the fire began. She said she acted mainly on instinct before being rescued by the firefighters' ladder. She used her chair to break glass. `` I busted out a couple of windows so we could breathe fresh air,'' Ms. <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> said after being treated for smoke inhalation. `` We tried to get out of the building but there was no way _ we were trapped.'' <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Komsky </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION>, which manages the building, said the cause of the fire will be investigated.

Leftist coalition head <PERSON> Harilaos </PERSON> <PERSON> Florakis </PERSON> emerged from a meeting today with <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Constantine </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON> to announce he would support an interim government led by <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> parliamentarian <PERSON> Tzanis </PERSON> <PERSON> Tzannetakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Florakis </PERSON> conferred with President <PERSON> Christos </PERSON> <PERSON> Sartzetakis </PERSON> to detail the agreement that allows their coalition to have a majority in the 300-member parliament and end eight years of government by the <ORGANIZATION> Panhellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Premier </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>. Besieged by a supportive crowd as he left the Presidential Palace, <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON> said the negotiations had ended positively and that he had agreed on <PERSON> Tzannetakis </PERSON> as premier designate. The president's office announced later that <PERSON> Tzannetakis </PERSON> would be sworn in on Sunday. <PERSON> Tzannetakis </PERSON>, 62, is popular among his colleagues in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and known for his fervent belief in democratic institutions. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>, tainted by financial scandals and a highly publicized relationship with a woman while he was married, had been asked by Sartzetakis to remain as caretaker premier until the crisis was resolved. Parliament is scheduled to convene Monday and elect a house speaker the next day. The new government goes before parliament in two weeks to seek a vote of confidence. <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Florakis </PERSON> agreed that the coalition would have a three-month life span and that its work would be limited to restoring democratic institutions and cleaning up Greek politics. <PERSON> Florakis </PERSON> said that at the end of the three months, `` We will re-examine our position and act accordingly.'' However, one of the two parties could pull out of the coalition because of wide differences in political ideology. If that happens, the president would then appoint another caretaker regime consisting of non-parliamentarians to lead the country to national elections. The new coalition accord followed five days of meetings between leaders of the two groups. The conservative-leftist coalition would resolve the political crisis that followed general elections on June 18. New Democracy won 145 seats, six short of a majority. It thus needed to find a partner if it was to govern. The Coalition of the Left and Progress captured 28 seats, while the larger <ORGANIZATION> Panhellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> took 125 seats. Two seats in this month's elections were also won by the small conservative <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Renewal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION> and an independent. Today's agreement came after attempts by leaders of all three major parties failed to form a coalition government. The new parliament is to form a 12-member committee to investigate allegations that <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> and at least 20 other former ministers from his party and officials were involved in multimillion-dollar financial scandals. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> has denied any wrongdoing. The conservative-leftist alliance is considered a major blow to the socialists, who called on the communists to cooperate in a government of progressive forces. But <PERSON> Florakis </PERSON> turned them down, saying he would not join forces with a `` scandal-ridden'' group. The coalition talks were the first time in the history of <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, a nation of 10 million, that the communists had been given the opportunity to help form a government.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s new military leader today said ending a devastating civil war was his top priority and he promised to make new offers of peace to the rebels. Twenty-eight army generals were fired. Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Bashir </PERSON> told a meeting of senior government officials that the peace overtures begun last month by Prime Minister <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Mahdi </PERSON>, whom he toppled on Friday, were `` political machinations and not serious.'' The 6-year-old war crippled the economy and led to widespead famine that has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives. The brigadier general, 44, led a military junta of 15 officers in the bloodless coup, the fourth military upheaval in <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s 33 years of independence. Calling itself the command council of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolution </ORGANIZATION>, the junta immediately assumed dictatorial powers, including a ban on dissent. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolution </ORGANIZATION> council today announced the firing of 28 army generals, including the commander-in-chief, Gen. Fat ` hi <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>, and the chief of staff, Gen. <PERSON> Babu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nimir </PERSON>, a strong supporter of The meet was broadcast over official <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Omdurman </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> remained under a nighttime curfew decreed after the coup, but the city appeared returning to normal today despite tight security. Hundreds of troops were seen on the streets, stopping and searching cars. Tanks and armored cars were posted at the presidential palace, army headquarters and bridges spanning the White Nile and Blue Nile rivers. Telex and telephone communications with <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>, cut immediately after the coup, were restored today. <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> reopened for eight hours today for planes carrying Moslem pilgrims to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> but remained closed to other international traffic. <PERSON> El-Bashir </PERSON> criticized <PERSON> el-Mahdi </PERSON>'s efforts to negotiate peace with southern rebels at a meeting of government undersecretaries. But he made clear that his government is committed to peace. `` Our primary goal is peace, and we -LRB- the army -RRB- are the people mostly suffering from war,'' he said. `` I will enlist the help of all experts in the quest for peace.'' Radio Omdurman frequently interrupted its programming to broadcast messages of support from military units for el-Bashir. The coup leaders on Friday issued decrees that suspended the constitution and shut down independent newspapers. They banned political parties, declared a national state of emergency and the indefinite nighttime curfew. <PERSON> El-Bashir </PERSON> named himself prime minister, defense minister and armed forces commander. The fate of <PERSON> el-Mahdi </PERSON> following the coup remained unclear. One report said he escaped arrest. Another said he was seen being driven from his home by soldiers. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> alluded Friday to reports that a number of Cabinet minister were arrested. `` We regret the military is taking action to overthrow <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s democratically elected government, and we urge an early return to democracy,'' she said <PERSON> El-Bashir </PERSON> has pledged a non-partisan government and good relations with all countries. He made no mention of restoring civilian rule. The coup leaders have disavowed any connection with the former military dictator, President <PERSON> Gaafar </PERSON> <PERSON> Nimeiri </PERSON>, who was ousted by his top generals in April 1985. <PERSON> Nimeiri </PERSON>, in power for 16 years, recently pledged from exile in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> to overthrow el-Mahdi and return to power. A Nimeiri aide reached by telephone said the former president was in the Egyptian capital but unavailable for comment. <PERSON> El-Bashir </PERSON> is said to be apolitical, although he is a member of the religious sect that forms the power base of the opposition Democratic Unionists. Another <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> newspaper, <ORGANIZATION> Al-Gomhuriya </ORGANIZATION>, described <PERSON> el-Bashir </PERSON> as a `` well-liked, sociable'' officer who studied in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> but is considered anti-communist. A former commander of paratroopers fighting in the civil war in southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, el-Bashir was the third-ranking officer in the corps before the coup. The war has caused widespread famine and turned many southerners into refugees. Like most ranking Sudanese officers and government officials, <PERSON> Bashir </PERSON> is a northern Moslem of Arab extraction. The rebels are Christians and animists of African descent who demand more autonomy for the south.

 Solidarity-backed lawmakers met today to decide who to back for president, a powerful new post that <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> says he does not want. Solidarity has opposed a candidacy by <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, who said on Friday that he did not want to run because he was too closely linked to the 1981 martial-law crackdown that crushed the labor union and forced it underground. <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> recommended Interior Minister <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> for the office, which is similar to the presidency created in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said today he believed <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> had a better chance of winning the post than <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>. The president is to be elected next week by a simple majority of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. Authorities want to have the new president seated before President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s scheduled three-day visit begins July 9. `` Whether it's <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> or <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> is an internal problem of the government coalition. It seems in this concrete situation that Gen. <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> has a better chance,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> told reporters before the meeting of pro-Solidarity lawmakers. `` The general is paying now for everything bad that took place in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Guilty or not guilty _ let historians think about it _ that's how it is.'' <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> helped negotiate the historic accord between the communist-run government and the Solidarity-led opposition that resulted in the legalization of the trade union, opposition participation in elections and broad changes in the structure of the government. The 259-member Solidarity delegation in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> met behind closed doors. A Solidarity source inside the meeting lawmakers were discussing the possibility of finding a party or neutral candidate they could support. The source said the legislators also debated nominating a Solidarity candidate, an idea the union so far has opposed. At Friday's meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, officials neither accepted nor rejected <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>'s proposal that he not run for president. But the committee did ask him to reconsider, party spokesman <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bisztyga </PERSON> said. Party representatives to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> did the same. Outside party headquarters about 500 young anti-Jaruzelski demonstrators tried to march to the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting, but riot police blocked them. The youths hurled stones, smoke bombs and firebombs at police, who fired tear gas and bursts from a water cannon in encounters that lasted for hours. The state news agency <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said 11 police were hurt and 14 demonstrators were detained. <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, 65, said he chose not to run because he was too closely associated with the crackdown on Solidarity. `` The key matter for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> now ... is national agreement ... When there is an obstacle to reconciliation and to the uniting of social forces, there is only one possible solution _ even if that obstacle is <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>,'' he said in his statement, later carried by state media. Endorsing <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>, sitting a few seats away, <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> called him `` a soldier, a politician, a patriot and a man who has been close to me for many years ... In the eyes of society, including opposition circles, he is rightly considered a leading representative of the line of reconciliation.'' <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> said nothing about leaving his powerful post as party chief. Also Friday, the government announced a one-month wage-and-price freeze, halting major price increases until after the new parliament and government are seated. <PERSON> Bisztyga </PERSON> indicated that some legislators in the communist-led coalition fear that <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> lacks enough votes in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> for a safe election. The coalition nominally has a 300-259 majority over Solidarity-backed legislators, but its internal discipline is wobbly. <PERSON> Bisztyga </PERSON> said a final decision on a nominee will be made at a later party meeting after consultations with the two junior partners in the coalition _ the <ORGANIZATION> Peasant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> parties. `` If decisions of those groups show a safe election calculation, then there is a possibility'' <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> would be the nominee after all, <PERSON> Bisztyga </PERSON> said. Otherwise, <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> would be considered. A <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> loyalist, <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>, 63, is an army general who heads <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s extensive police apparatus and helped wage the government's war against Solidarity for most of the 1980's But he won the confidence of Solidarity's leaders during negotiations that began last Aug. 31 during a national wave of strikes. In parliamentary elections June 4 and June 18, Solidarity got 99 of its candidates elected to the 100-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, and it won all the 161 seats available to the opposition in the 460-member Sejm.

 Syrian and Lebanese Christian gunners today battled with howitzers and rocket launchers, ignoring <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> calls to halt 15 weeks of violence. Police said three people were killed and 16 wounded. The latest casualties increased the toll to 385 people killed and 1,515 wounded since the latest round in the 14-year-old civil war broke out March 8, pitting Christian army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s units against Syrian and Druse forces. In <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> today declared it is ready to cut off arms shipments to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Christians if other countries stop providing weapons to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Moslems. `` Other countries'' was a reference to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, which has 40,000 troops in Moslem-held territory under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate. The Syrians have refused repeated calls by the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> to lift the siege of the Christian enclave, saying they wanted guarantees that <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> will not be able to receive war material from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, their main Arab foe. Syrian gunners, deployed in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and the surrounding mountains, pounded the 310-square-mile Christian-held region northeast of the capital with 130mm howitzers and 107mm multibarrelled rocket launchers. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s gunners responded with 155mm howitzers. The spokesman said the Syrian barrage targeted two east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> Christian districts, the coastline north of the capital and the wooded valleys east of the waterfront, where <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s artillery batteries are deployed. He said <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s gunners responded against the Syrian artillery batteries along west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s seaside boulevard. A spokesman for <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s command, who refused to be further identified, said his gunners `` scored several direct hits on the Syrian artillery emplacements in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>.'' The command of a Syrian army contingent in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> refused comment on losses. Witnesses, speaking on condition of anonymity, reported seeing a Syrian army ambulance rushing to a seaside Syrian howitzer emplacement in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> shortly before dawn. `` Seconds later, the ambulance sped out of the emplacement, which is hidden behind sand ramparts. I do n't know what happened there,'' one witness said. The thud of exploding shells and the whistling of rockets echoed across <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and its surroundings. The intensity of the barrage sharply decreased around 8 a.m., allowing people to leave underground shelters. No explanation was given for the escalation in the confrontation, which came a few hours before a scheduled meeting in the Saudi town of <LOCATION> Jeddah </LOCATION> by three <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> foreign ministers to consider a mechanism for stabilizing <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. A full-fledged Arab summit in May urged a settlement to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year-old civil war by November The confrontation broke out two days after <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> blockaded illegal ports run by Syrian-backed militias south of beirut to salvage about $ 100 million in lost customs dues annually. The Syrians and their allies retaliated by besieging the Christian enclave, home for 1 million people. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> escalated the confrontation by declaring a `` war of liberation'' on the Syrian force deployed in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.

 If you fancy a grinning <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> clown doll or a bas-relief of the Last Supper in bilious brown plastic, the Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is the place for you. Famous for its priceless collection of books and manuscripts, the Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> also is the secret repository for perhaps the world's biggest collection of the ephemera of American pop culture. From birdbaths to Barbie dolls, the <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has it all. `` We do n't critique it, we just collect it,'' says <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evina </PERSON> of the library's <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Copyright Office, the government's keeper of kitsch. Here in this <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> suburb, miles from the library's hushed, oak-paneled main reading room on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Copyright </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> has schlepped enough schlock over the years to fill a cavernous warehouse nearly the size of a domed football stadium. Stuffed in cardboard boxes and stacked high on metal shelves are millions of wall plaques, plaster busts, T-shirts, games, puzzles, dolls, gaudy fabrics, cereal boxes, posters, lamps, garden fountains, door knockers, wall thermometers, whiskey decanters and other memorabilia of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s throwaway society. `` This is the creative genius of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Evina </PERSON> with a wave of his arm. `` Is n't it wonderful?'' Until the copyright law was changed in 1978, applicants for copyright protection for their music, writings or artistic designs were required to submit two samples of their work to the Copyright Office. That created a worsening headache for copyright officials, who had to store all that stuff somewhere, until <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> decided that photographs or written descriptions would suffice. Although the <ORGANIZATION> Copyright </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> has copyrighted more than 45 million items since the late 19th century, the bulk of the objects kept at the <LOCATION> Landover </LOCATION> warehouse cover pop culture of the late 1950s through the 1970s. For Watergate wallowers, there is the Watergate chess set. Pieces sculpted in white represent the good guys, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ervin </PERSON> and his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> investigators. Opposing pieces cast in a dark hues include President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> in a defiant pose, flanked by his gang of <PERSON> Haldeman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ehrlichman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>. Music lovers can sample more than 2 million audio tape cassettes of forgettable songs that were copyrighted _ but never published _ by neighborhood garage rock bands. Sample titles: `` Punch a Wall,'' `` Where Does All This Love Come From?'' and `` Take Me Back to Adolescence.'' Among the plaster likenesses of <PERSON> Buddha </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harpo </PERSON> <PERSON> Marx </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Quixote </PERSON>, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schweitzer </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Laurel </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> and a snarling German shepherd was a stack of X-rated videos, including `` Hot Nights at the Blue Note Cafe,'' and a box of pornographic paperback novels with titles like `` Naughty, Naughty Wife.'' Flower pots came in the shape of hippos, lions, snails, turtles and frogs. There was a fire hydrant ice bucket in bright red, a fake gold Miss <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> trophy from 1955 and a plastic wall thermometer decorated with a woodpecker and a button that's supposed to turn blue for fair weather and pink for rain. Whiskey decanters portrayed Democratic donkeys and Republican elephants, a Hawaiian warrior, a crank-operated telephone, a pair of combat boots and helmet, antique cars and a pyramid representing the <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kahir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shrine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cedar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rapids </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. The collection is closed to the public, but <PERSON> Evina </PERSON> says the Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> probably ought to mount an exhibition of this lowlife Americana some day. A few mementos from yesteryear, such as once-familiar cereal boxes and toothpaste tubes no longer seen on store shelves, may exist only in the <ORGANIZATION> Copyright </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>'s collection and would be irreplaceable, he said. `` Someday someone will thank us for keeping all these things,'' said the government's guru of gewgaws.

<HEAD>Industry Says EPA May Tamper With Bush's Clean Air Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Industries with the highest stakes in clean air legislation are lobbying to make sure stringent enforcement provisions are n't slipped into the formal bill submitted to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. Industry lobbyists say they believe some <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> officials want to be tougher on industry than does President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who unveiled his clean air plan June 12. Lobbyists for the auto, electric utility and petroleum industries say they are particularly concerned about tougher standards on acid rain, additional curbs on motor vehicle pollution, and the amount of flexibility that industry will be given to reduce pollutants. The bill promises to be at the center of a major congressional struggle for at least the next six months. `` We're emphasizing the importance of sticking with the president's program,'' said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> lobbyist who has participated in petroleum industry meetings with administration officials since <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> outlined his plan. `` If they start dragging in cats and dogs ... it will slow down the process considerably,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> responded: `` If the rumor is we're going off in directions rejected by the -LRB- administration's -RRB- Domestic Policy Council, that's absolutely false We're taking a very conservative approach to making the president's idea work.'' The industry lobbyists said their concern was inspired in part by an early <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> draft of the legislation, which contained measures industry did n't like, but which preceded <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s announcement and is now _ everyone agrees _ outdated. They added that administration officials listened, but made no specific commitments on legislative language. The industry executives pointed out that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> only revealed the broad outlines and goals of his plan, while leaving the legislative drafting _ where a word or numerical change can make an enormous difference _ to technical and policy experts. `` Our concern is the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> will try to make the bill more stringent than <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> indicated,'' said one lobbyist for a large utility who participated in one meeting and was familiar with several others. `` I would say the effort is low-key, fairly targeted and fairly discreet.'' The lobbyist, who spoke only on condition his name not be used, said utilities are concerned with the acid rain reduction plan because <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not use precise language on the amount of sulfur dioxide emissions to be permitted by coal-fired power plants. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said his proposal `` envisions'' an emission standard of 2.5 pounds per million BTUs through 1995. That would be tightened to `` approximately'' 1.2 pounds per million BTUs through the year 2000. `` Those words give <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> room to wiggle around'' in achieving the sought-after 10 million-ton sulfur dioxide reduction, the lobbyist said, noting that <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has in the past discussed an even tougher standard for the 1995-2000 phase. The industry official added that at a meeting with <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials, `` We did n't accuse them of subverting what the president said, but <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> knew why were were inquiring about some of these things.'' The auto industry, which says the replacement of old cars with new ones will lower motor vehicle emissions, is wary of new tailpipe standards. The petroleum industry is concerned about how far <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan for alternative motor vehicle fuels will go Other industry concerns are that <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> might try to impose strong permit requirements that would be a `` bureaucratic nightmare,'' insert strong federal authority over state and local governments and give the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> administrator wider powers. There has been no comparable lobbying effort by environmental organizations, said <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> <PERSON> Padgett </PERSON>, director of Environmental Action. `` Trying to lobby <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> would be trying to lobby our friends,'' <PERSON> Padgett </PERSON> said. `` And we do n't have the access to <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Office of Management and Budget -RRB- that industry does.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayres </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Clean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> composed of major environmental groups, said he's willing to wait for the `` fine print'' before launching any lobbying campaign. One oil industry lobbyist said, however, he thinks <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will keep his proposal free from tampering. `` This president is hands-on'' and `` he's going to want to see it and understand it,'' said <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Himmelstein </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>.

It is hard to find a leader anywhere more willing to support <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s policies than <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON>, but he is a leader who tolerates virtually no dissent while presiding over what is widely regarded as one of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s most corrupt societies. <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> himself has accumulated vast personal wealth, taking the form of a number of castles and palaces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and elsewhere and huge foreign bank accounts. Some estimates of these accounts run into the billions but <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> has put the figure at `` less than $ 50 million.'' <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> expert and liberal critic of <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON>, derides <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> as a `` kleptocracy.'' Successive administrations in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> dating back to <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON>'s rise to power in 1965 have been willing to overlook <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON>'s perceived shortcomings and focus instead on his unswerving willingness to support <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> strategic At a time when so many Third World countries, regardless of political system, have shied away from supporting <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s foreign policy agenda, <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> is an exception He has allowed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military use of Zairean territory to resupply anti-communist guerrillas in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. He played a major role in bringing about a cease-fire in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s civil war on June 22, a goal that had eluded the efforts of others for 14 years. He has been an outspoken opponent of <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>. His representatives have lobbied hard against anti-American resolutions in the Organization of African Unity and other Third World groups. A month ago, he helped the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration fend off a bid by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> to join the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. When the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> decided to boycott the 1980 Olympics in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> ordered <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>'s athletes to stay home as well. But then there is <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON>'s authoritarian side, which was described recently by <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, a New York-based group which attempts to promote democracy throughout the world. In <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>, the report said, `` presidential elections are farces. Private newspaper ownership remains only in name. Broadcasting is government owned and directed. Censorship and self-censorship are pervasive. There is no right of assembly, and union organization is controlled. Government has been arbitrary and capricious. The judiciary is not independent; prisoners of conscience are numerous, and execution and torture common.'' In terms of human freedom, the report ranked <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> at about the same level as <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> which, like <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>, is a one-party state. Corruption in <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>, the study said, is `` pervasive.'' Many of the same criticisms are contained in the annual <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> human rights report. None of the supposed drawbacks appears to have had much impact on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid programs in <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>. Hundreds of millions of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid dollars have been earmarked for <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> under <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON>'s rule. The aid levels recently have been averaging a shade under $ 50 million, making <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> one of the largest aid recipients in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. When President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> received <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> on Thursday, he skirted the human rights issue, concentrating instead in his public remarks on the Zairean's diplomatic achievements and his staunch backing for American policies. During his visit, <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> dismissed questions about human rights abuses, contending that he has the support of `` 100 percent'' of <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>'s 34 million people. And for all the sympathy he has received from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> over the years, <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> indicated in an appearance Friday that his friendship has not always been reciprocated. Seemingly more in sorrow than in anger, <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> received eight times more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid than <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> several years ago despite staking out anti-U.S. positions. `` We have been a steadfast friend,'' he said. `` I find this a bit confusing.''

 A judge declared a mistrial in a murder case after learning that the jury foreman had brought a dictionary into the deliberations so jurors could look up words the judge used in his instructions. `` It was highly improper,'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, attorney for defendant <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> <PERSON> Davison </PERSON>, said Friday. `` They were sitting in the jury room using a dictionary to determine the guilt or innocence of my client.''

One of the words he said jurors looked up was `` malice,'' defined by the Random House Dictionary of the English Language as a `` desire to inflict injury or suffering on another, especially when based on deep-seated meanness.'' The law, however, defines malice differently.

<TEXT>
 For <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> students who saw their own dreams of democracy crushed last year, the suppression of pro-democracy demonstrators in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> conjures up bitter memories. Several thousand protesters were killed in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> when the military put down a nationwide uprising demanding political reform and an end to a quarter century of economic mismanagement and authoritarian, one-party rule. `` We feel for the Chinese students because the same things have happened to us,'' said <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Myint </PERSON>, who was a university student during the <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> uprising. `` It seems that there is n't much difference between the military in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the military in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>.'' Unlike `` people power'' struggles in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and elsewhere in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, force has largely succeeded, at least for the time being, in stifling popular cries for democracy in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. But nine months after <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> put down its uprising, the political climate remains uncertain. Elections have been promised in the spring of 1990 and oppostion parties have been permitted. But the opposition groups complain of harrassment and continuing arrests, and many doubt the military will be willing to transfer power in the future. `` What we saw in both countries was a challenge to established authority in a form that they were not willing to countenance,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Leifer </PERSON> a <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> expert in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. He said a common factor in both countries, which seemed to lead to the bloody climaxes, was an older generation of leaders controlling the events. <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> expert <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverstein </PERSON> notes differences between the top leaders of the two countries. `` <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> was a whole lot smarter and -LRB- <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s -RRB- Ne Win a whole lot crueler,'' the American academic said in an interview, noting <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s economic progress and <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s stagnation. Although Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> is nominally <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s head of state, Western diplomats say 78-year-old strongman Ne Win retains power, despite his official retirement last July. In <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, no promise of political change has been indicated. But both countries have pledged to pursue domestic economic reforms and open doors to foreign economic influence, which in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s case had been closed since the early 1960s. The international community was outraged by both crackdowns and announced economic sanctions. But within a few months the boycott of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> began to erode. Critics say the revival of trade ties, mostly by <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> countries, has boosted the military government and works against the democratic movement. If maintained, international economic sanctions were likely to be more damaging to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s more sophisticated economy, <PERSON> Leifer </PERSON> said. Years of socialist mismanagement took <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, once one of <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>'s richest countries, to the brink of economic collapse. <PERSON> Silverstein </PERSON> believes it was because of this that <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s uprising attracted great popular support. He believes the <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> `` revolution'' was on the verge of success until the military became worried about splits within its ranks. Only then did it move decisively to crush the demonstrators. Some differences were also reported within the Chinese military, but if they existed they were finally overridden. In <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, students like <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Myint </PERSON> are last year's heroes. While Chinese dissidents are feted in the West and allowed generous visa extensions, <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> students complain they are largely ignored. <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Myint </PERSON> was among the estimated 7,500 students who fled the repression. He said he decided to go after witnessing the killing of five close friends and many others at the gates of <ORGANIZATION> Mandalay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Univerity </ORGANIZATION>. He now lives at <LOCATION> Manerplaw </LOCATION>, the jungle headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> Karen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, an ethnic rebel group fighting for greater autonomy. Several hundred <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> students are fighting alongside the rebels. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressmen last week voted $ 2 million in humanitarian aid to the exiled Burmese, many of whom suffer harsh jungle conditions and have contracted malaria. The students say more could be done for them and against the <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> government by the international community. <PERSON> Silverstein </PERSON> said the political climate in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> is more volatile than in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, `` I do n't think for a moment there has been any settling down, the heavy hand of the military has squashed but not eliminated,'' he said. `` I think ... that while <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> has found his man and the system will go forward. Ne Win has still to find his man and his system.''

 Three Kurdish guerillas were killed Saturday in a clash with security forces, the semi-official <ORGANIZATION> Anatolia </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. The agency said the security forces were conducting a search in a mountainous area near the Syrian border when they encountered the guerrillas and ordered them to surrender. The rebels opened fire, the agency said. Security forces have launched a massive operation in the mountains of southeastern <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> as a result of the increase of Kurdish attacks over the past two months. Kurdish rebels are fighting for an independent Marxist state in parts of eastern and southeastern <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>.

 Buzz <PERSON> Aldrin </PERSON> laments that `` the promise of Apollo was never fulfilled,'' that the American space program languished after he and <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> left the first human footprints on the moon two decades ago. He says he hopes the 20th anniversary of Apollo 11 will `` become a catalyst for the country to chart a bold course for human expansion outward.'' But given today's political and tight budgetary climate, <PERSON> Aldrin </PERSON> is not too hopeful. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is expected to voice continuing support for a permanent manned space station and say other nice things about <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s program when he meets with <PERSON> Aldrin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> and their command module pilot, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, on July 20, the anniversary of the moon landing. But no matter how many nice things the president says about space, the political truth is that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> must approve the money. And with the space station already facing a sharp funding cut, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is not expected to give much support to new projects. So the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> once again is at a crossroads, as it was when the glory days of Apollo ended. President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> had committed this nation to landing a man on the moon in the 1960s. The goal was to gain space superiority over the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, whose early feats had earned the Russians worldwide respect and shocked Americans. When the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> won the race to the moon, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> laid out bold plans for the future. To a presidential panel, agency head <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Paine </PERSON> in 1969 proposed a 12-man space station and a reusable space shuttle in operation as early as 1976, followed by a station in moon orbit, a base on the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION>, a 50-man space station in Earth orbit and a manned mission to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION> in the 1980s. But in a period of unrest due to domestic racial problems and involvement in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, costly plans to explore space were given low priority. Only the reuseable space shuttle survived, and its proposed funding was cut deeply. `` Those were tough times,'' said <PERSON> Paine </PERSON>, who resigned in frustration a year after Apollo 11. The <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administrations were lukewarm toward the space program, but the shuttle was built. It performed capably as a space truck for 24 missions until Jan. 28, 1986, when the Challenger exploded, killing its seven crew members and grounding the program for 32 months. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> had gained some hope from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s endorsement of a strong space program and from his 1984 State of the Union message, in which he backed building the space station Freedom. In 1985, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> created a commission to define long-term space goals. Its chief was <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Paine </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> administrator. Six months after Challenger, <PERSON> Paine </PERSON> stood in the Oval Office and gave <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> a slick leather-bound volume that recommended the space station, a lunar base and manned trips to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION> _ essentially an update of <PERSON> Paine </PERSON>'s 1969 plan. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> two years later signed a Presidential Directive on National Space Policy that stated space leadership was a fundamental objective. It endorsed the space station and, without being specific, set a long-range goal `` to expand human presence and activity beyond <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> orbit into the solar system.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s policy set in motion a <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> program named Pathfinder whose goal is to test technologies for manned and robotic exploration of the moon and planets, advanced missions in orbit and on planetary surfaces, extended human presence in space, and space transportation to the moon and planets. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has not disclosed his thinking beyond saying he supports a space station. He established the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, headed by Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, to recommend a comprehensive space policy. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is expected to have a preliminary outline ready for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s anniversary meeting with the Apollo 11 astronauts <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> needs a decision from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> soon on how much money it can spend next year on space station Freedom. A permanent orbiting space station is essential to those ambitious Pathfinder dreams and would serve as a training base and launch pad for flights deeper into space. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has requested $ 2.05 billion in the budget for fiscal 1990 to continue work on the station. Predictions are that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will trim that by $ 400 million to $ 700 million, amounts that space officials say could further delay or even kill the project. The space station project has gone through five tumultuous years. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> wanted it built in cooperation with <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s major allies, but there were stormy sessions over access to the station before 10 European nations, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> agreed to invest nearly $ 8 billion to build sections of it. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said in 1984 it could begin launching segments of the orbiting laboratory in 1992 and estimated the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cost at $ 8 billion. In 1987, agency officials revised the pricetag to $ 14.6 billion. The new figure covered a suddenly scaled-down Phase One, which left off two of the external struts to which experiment modules would be attached. The struts would be added in orbit under Phase Two. Shortly after that, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> panel reviewing station costs and technical issues for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said the total cost to develop and deploy the first phase would be $ 25.02 billion, with Phase Two raising the cost to $ 32.8 billion. The schedule began slipping. And <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> now says if it receives the proper funding, it could begin assembling the station in 1995. Some in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> believe <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> should alter its plans and build a less complex station and, instead of relying totally on the space shuttle, develop a large unmanned rocket to do much of the lifting job. Orbiting at 250 miles, Freedom would be home to a crew of eight, with astronauts rotating back to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> after four to six months. The station would allow humans to study the stars and planets from the pollution-free environment of space. The weightless interior would permit manufacture of new, contamination-free medicines and other products impossible to create on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. Astronauts would assemble, service and repair satellites and send them out into space. And the station could eventually be the staging point for man's return to the moon or a journey to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>. No one can predict whether these grand plans will come about, but the three astronauts who made that extraordinary Apollo 11 flight to the moon 20 years ago think they should. `` A permanent presence in space is a worthy objective, and I hope that space station Freedom becomes a reality,'' <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> said recently. `` I strongly endorse the station, a scientific base on the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION> and eventually manned flights to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Buzz </PERSON> <PERSON> Aldrin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, who orbited the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION> while <ORGANIZATION> Armstrong </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Aldrin </PERSON> walked its surface, envisioned setting up a colony on <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>. `` We're a nation of explorers,'' he said. `` We started on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, we went to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, and then vertically. Starting with the <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> brothers, <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeager </PERSON> through the sound barrier, <ORGANIZATION> Armstrong </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Aldrin </PERSON> on the moon. `` It's in our tradition, it's in our culture.''

 An Iran-bound ship believed to be carrying a chemical used to make deadly mustard gas docked here today, sources said. West German television said it would be stopped before reaching <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio today denied that the shipment, which is at the center of a chemical weapons scandal in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, was bound for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The West German-flagged <ORGANIZATION> Seacrest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pioneer </ORGANIZATION> docked in <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> today from <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, Dubai-based shipping sources said on condition of anonymity. The sources said the ship was due to leave later today to return to <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>, but they had no word on the ship's cargo or whether any part of it was unloaded. The ZDF network in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> on Friday identified the ship as the <LOCATION> Seacrest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pioneer </LOCATION> and said it was carrying thionyl chloride, a compound used to make mustard gas. The report quoted unidentified government sources in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>. West German prosecutors said Thursday they had opened a criminal investigation of <ORGANIZATION> Rheineisen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Duesseldorf </ORGANIZATION>, which contracted to deliver to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> more than 250 tons of thionyl chloride. Government officials said Friday they had information that the shipment had left <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION> but gave no further details. Officials of the company, run by an Iranian family, earlier had claimed they had halted the shipment on Wednesday in <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>. Rheineisen officials deny any wrongdoing and say they had government approval for the 257-ton shipment. The company has said it would cooperate in stopping the shipment. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> today quoted an Indian official as saying the Indian government's <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> sold <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> 60 tons of thionyl chloride in March. The official was quoted as saying the chemical was shipped from <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION> and the sale did not represent a breach of local laws because the chemical is a freely traded commodity often used in pesticides. The Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it never planned to purchase chemicals from a West German company to produce poison gas. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio, in a commentary today, denied allegations that a shipment of chemicals to manufacture chemical weapons was bound for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. It said the reports were perpetrated by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and showed renewed American hostility toward <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, quoted an unidentified ministry spokesman as saying the allegations were `` false, biased and followed particular political propaganda goals.'' The spokesman `` categorically denied reports on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s intention to purchase chemical materials for manufacture of chemical weapons'' and accused <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> media of making up the story. The news agency also quoted the spokesman as denying the Iranians had summoned home a diplomat in the case. The West German <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said it had asked <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to recall the diplomat after receiving information from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that he allegedly was involved in the deal. But the diplomat left before a formal request was made. The Iranian spokesman said the diplomat's tour of duty had ended more than a month ago and that he had returned to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, according to the Iranian news agency. Sources in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> identified the man as <PERSON> Seyed </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Sobhani </PERSON> and said he had worked for the Iranian Embassy here since September 1987. The Rheineisen disclosures follow an international uproar six months ago over the involvement of West German companies in building a factory outside <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said would be used to make poison gas. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> said the plant would produce pharmaceuticals.

<HEAD>Students Clash with Police; President Orders Crackdown on Leaders</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Radical students protesting a government ban on travel to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> clashed violently with police Saturday, and President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON> ordered a crackdown on student leaders. At <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hanyang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, the 24-hour siege of a classroom building ended after hundreds of students wielding metal pipes and clubs fled down a hillside through a police blockade. Some were arrested and others surrendered. More than 1,000 students barricaded themselves in the building Friday after riot police stormed the campus to break up a rally of thousands of students planning to march to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The students wanted to attend this week's World Youth Festival in the North Korean capital of <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>. Police arrested about 650 students Friday and 100 Saturday in the biggest single raid inside a college campus since <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> came to power in February 1988. About 2,000 riot police stayed inside the campus overnight. The <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> government banned participation in the youth festival and said anyone going would be charged with violations of national security. Prosecutors said Im Suk-yong, a 20-year-old <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> student who traveled to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> through third countries, would be arrested when she returned. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> issued a statement Saturday saying authorities would punish anyone who had unauthorized contacts with communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The North has `` instigated students and other figures to secretly visit <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> ... showing that the North is still harboring an intent to communize the South,'' he said. Police arrested 100 students Saturday before the building siege ended. Many were caught after several hundred students wielding pipes and firebombs slid down a steep hill behind the building and raced from campus with police in pursuit. Witnesses said about 20 police and students were injured in fighting before the students fled. Twenty-two student leaders later surrendered to police peacefully after a college official was allowed to talk to the students. Students at four other <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> campuses demonstrated against the police occupation of <LOCATION> Hanyang </LOCATION>. About 500 students took over a major intersection Saturday near downtown <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> shouting `` Down with police violence!'' and `` Participation in <LOCATION> Pyongyong </LOCATION> festival!'' newspapers reported. Reports said they hurled firebombs and rocks at riot police. There were no injuries. The Korean peninsula was split into the communist North and capitalist South after World War II. The two countries fought a war from 1950-53 and remain bitter enemies.

<HEAD>Pope to Send Envoy to Poland; Full Diplomatic Ties Imminent</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> has decided to send a diplomatic envoy to <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, clearing the way for full relations between the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> and the pope's native <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, according to a papal letter released Saturday. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> would be the first <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact country to have full diplomatic ties with the Holy See. Relations were cut by the communists, who took power in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in 1945. In a letter to Cardinal <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON>, the nation's <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> leader, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said he was ready to send a representative to <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. `` The Apostolic See wishes that the decision that it now takes can constitute the full continuation of diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> wrote. A senior church official in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anomymity, said the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>'s decision `` means that full diplomatic relations are imminent, and it's not going to be a matter of months.'' The pope's letter was dated April 11. The church official said the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> chose to release it now so as not to link the diplomatic issue with the expected selection of a Polish president later this week. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said the Polish government has been seeking normalization of relations with the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> through the exchange of envoys, and that <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s bishops approved of the idea. `` At the current state of affairs, it seems possible, and even opportune, that the Holy See send to <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> a representative with appropriate characteristics,'' the letter said. The letter did not say who the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> envoy would be or what diplomatic title he would hold. The <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said the envoy's presence in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> was also important because Polish churchmen, <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> representatives and government officials have been preparing a Vatican-state accord, known as a Convention, that has been considered a condition for establishment of diplomatic ties. `` In this phase of preparations, the Holy See would be ready to send its representative to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> even before the signing of the Convention,'' the letter said. `` This is so the full-time representative of the Holy See in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> can participate in the final elaboration of the text of the Convention, which is an important document of international scope.'' The <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> now has diplomatic relations with 117 countries. The communist-led government of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, an overwhelmingly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> nation, has been eager to establish full relations with the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> to boost its standing. In May, the Polish <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> enacted three bills establishing the legal status of the church. The church has played an influential role in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Following the martial law crackdown in 1981, the church provided moral support to the banned opposition movement. Church officials were also instrumental in helping set up the talks that led to the legalization of Solidarity and to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s freest elections since World War II.

<HEAD>Plane Jolted in Storm over Cuba, Not Allowed To Change Course</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Two flight attendants were injured during a severe thunderstorm after an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jetliner was denied permission by <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> air traffic controllers to change course, officials said. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Shub </PERSON> said officials were considering filing a formal protest with the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> government. He said the incident Thursday night involving Flight 1089 from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, apparently stemmed from <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s recently announced warning that it would shoot down unauthorized aircraft as part of its anti-drug push. `` We have urged the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> government to exercise restraint in implementing its announced policy of shooting down unauthorized aircraft that do not land for inspection,'' <PERSON> Shub </PERSON> said. `` While we welcome the increased efforts to interdict narcotics trafficking, the loss of innocent life must be avoided.'' About 9:30 p.m. Thursday, the pilot radioed <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> air traffic controllers, asking if the plane could steer away from the sudden storm in a 17-mile-wide air corridor used by foreign carriers flying over <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, officials said. `` He asked if he could deviate to the left or right,'' <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` They refused to let him do it.'' No permission came, and `` as a result, they had to ride it on through. They could n't have made a U-turn within the air corridor,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. The 180 passengers were told to buckle their seat belts. The seven flight attendants were tossed by the storm and a lightning strike as they tried to put away food trays and other loose items, officials said. American is considering rerouting its <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and Latin American flights around <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Auken </PERSON>, area manager for <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s air route traffic control center, said there normally is good cooperation between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Cuban air traffic controllers. American spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> said one of the injured flight attendants was treated at a <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION> hospital, but he had no details. The other injured flight attendant did n't require treatment, he said.

<HEAD>Water District Orders Removal of Unauthorized New Lawns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Owners of 20 new homes have been given one month to dig up their lawns, planted in violation of drought restrictions. `` What are people supposed to do, tell their kids to run out and play in the mud?'' developer <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Rupprecht </PERSON>, one of the people who planted grass, complained Friday. `` The drought is over. Everbody knows that.'' Not true, says the East Bay Municipal Utility District. Despite spring downpours, reservoirs are still well below normal in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ramon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. Officials of the two-county utility district mailed notices to owners of 20 new homes ordering removal of grass. Like everyone who applied for a permit after May 10, 1988, to hook up to the district's water system, they were required to agree not to plant a lawn, water conservation manager <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. `` We get about 4,000 new customers a year. Just 20 did n't go along. We have to be fair to everyone,'' he said.

<HEAD>Thousands Of Small Planes Left With No Place To Land</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Owners of small aircraft and several members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are trying to get the government to reconsider a new rule that leaves thousands of planes with no place to land near the nation's biggest cities. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said the order requiring altitude signalling devices on all planes flying within 30 miles of the most congested airports `` should significantly reduce the danger of midair collisions.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> rule took effect Saturday. But pilots and small plane owners say it will clutter air traffic control screens, effectively bar 40,000 planes from 1,200 airports near big cities, and do nothing to enhance safety. Under the rule, only planes carrying Mode C transponders can fly within 30 miles of the nation's 27 most congested airports. Mode C sends a signal telling air traffic controllers where the plane is and at what altitude. The transponders have always been required for planes that use major airports, but they have not previously been required for low-altitude flights past the airports or for access to smaller general aviation airports that fall within the 30-mile `` veils.'' <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Weil </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the 290,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Owners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said the order will effectively put off-limits to non-Mode C planes all the airports in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> basin, scores of public and private airports and helipads around <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, and hundreds of airports near other cities that serve vital business and medical air traffic. `` We can no longer fly under the wedding cake,'' Ms. <PERSON> Weil </PERSON> said, referring to the air traffic control rules that previously allowed small planes to fly within progressively lower altitudes as they get nearer major airports, like flying under an inverted wedding cake. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Walbrun </PERSON> of the 125,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Experimental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oshkosh </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Wisc. </LOCATION>, said the rule will overburden air traffic controllers. `` It's a little bit like trying to use computers to control traffic in downtown <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' he said, adding that the traffic control system is not geared to watch the scores of small planes flying well below the altitude of major airliners. `` The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> has imposed a situation that will not enhance safety and put it into effect more quickly than their own system can handle,'' he said. Many pilots are faced with the prospect of either spending from $ 900 to $ 2,000 to equip their planes with Mode C or move their airplanes to more-remote airports. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>, in justifying the new rule, said it `` will have a major positive impact on safety by providing air traffic controllers with vital altitude information so potential conflicts between aircraft can be safely resolved.'' But last week, 18 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members sent a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> calling for him to delay implementation of the rule until provisions can be made for access to smaller airports that fall within the veils. `` The fact is that safety does not require universal installment of automatic altitude reporting transponders,'' the lawmakers said, adding that government should not impose unnecessary regulations that impose `` great cost on private individuals.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> members said that if the Mode C requirement were limited to areas around major airports that are reached by radar, rather than the arbitrary 30-mile limit, it would open up 600 to 700 smaller general aviation airports. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> has exempted from the rule antique aircraft, balloons and other aircraft without electrical systems necessary to run transponders. The agency also acknowledged last week that many aircraft owners may have postponed purchase of Mode C units awaiting the outcome of an aircraft owners' challenge to the rule, which the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> rejected only two weeks ago. To accommodate them, 90-day exemptions are being granted over the phone. Pilots who want to fly within a restricted area can call air traffic control authorities at the individual airport to get the exemptions. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> also indicated longer exemptions could be given for some operators who regularly use airports on the fringes of the veil in areas without radar coverage or for aircraft that can not be equipped to handle Mode C, but written requests are required. The transponder rule is to be extended to 111 additional airports at the end of next year. Aviation maps printed by the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> already show the forbidden zones, so pilots have known for some time where they wo n't be able to fly

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thousands of people chanting `` We want religious freedom!'' packed a <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> square on Saturday to mark the birthday of Cardinal <PERSON> Frantisek </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomasek </PERSON>, a critic of state control of the church. About 3,000 people gathered in the square outside <PERSON> Tomasek </PERSON>'s home following a special Mass at nearby St. Vitus Cathedral celebrating the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> leader's 90th birthday. `` Long live our cardinal!'' the crowd chanted as <PERSON> Tomasek </PERSON> appeared on the balcony overlooking the square. `` We want religious freedom!'' <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> is the only Soviet bloc country where communist authorities have for decades blocked the appointment of religious leaders for many of the country's 13 dioceses. <PERSON> Tomasek </PERSON> is a strong advocate of less state supervision of church affairs. Church officials estimate that half of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s 15 million people are <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>. Earlier, about 8,000 people from across <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> filled St. Vitus Cathedral for the Mass. Also attending were high-ranking Roman Catholic clergy from the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and other nations. Foreign dignitaries included <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Niemczyk </PERSON>. During the Mass, a special envoy from the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> read a letter from Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> applauding <PERSON> Tomasek </PERSON>'s work. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Tomasek </PERSON> `` for all that you have patiently endured'' and for devoting himself to the `` defense of the rights of the church and of mankind,'' according to the letter read by Italian Archbishop <PERSON> Francesco </PERSON> <PERSON> Colassuono </PERSON>. The pope's letter also mentioned <PERSON> Tomasek </PERSON>'s `` pain and exile'' during his career, an apparent reference to <PERSON> Tomasek </PERSON>'s 1951-54 internment in a labor camp after a communist crackdown on religion. In a short address, <PERSON> Tomasek </PERSON> stressed the importance of the church in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. `` Only Christ can give an answer to the hunger of our minds for truth and to the thirst of our hearts for love,'' <PERSON> Tomasek </PERSON> said at the Mass. On the square, some political activists circulated a human rights petition that has angered communist authorities. The petition demands the right to hold political demonstrations, freedom for all political prisoners, and a reassessment by communist authorities of the 1968 <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> Spring reforms, which were crushed by a Soviet-led invasion that year. Communist authorities have hinted that the signatories might be disciplined for their initiative. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Rude Pravo on Saturday called the petition an `` appeal to disrupt the republic.''

<HEAD>HUD Contractors Held Millions Owed Government but Agency Rarely Noticed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 After <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, his wife and his attorney gave up trying to audit the accounts he held as a private closing agent in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, the government decided to take a crack at it. When <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> auditors finished the math, they said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> owed the government more than $ 1.6 million for the period 1984-1987 but had only half that in the separate accounts he was required to keep for proceeds from the sale of single-family homes for the agency. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s story is like dozens of others, tales that together show an agency with little control over its private agents and even less control over its own accounting for the hundreds of millions of dollars the agents handle. In <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s case, the auditors decided $ 839,812 was missing from accounts. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s attorney protested, reminding the auditors they had spent time at <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>'s home and should be well aware of his `` modest lifestyle and extremely modest financial base.'' The attorney, <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Novy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, said in a letter December 1987 to <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> could no longer afford to pay for legal services and that the government's efforts to trace the money `` are fruitless.'' The government disagrees, and is trying to recover the money plus interest in a $ 7.5 million civil suit. Audits of closing agents in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> and elsewhere produced similar findings: most of the agents were sending <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> its money late; some were n't sending it at all. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, already strapped for funds because of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration cutbacks, was losing millions of dollars a year in interest. `` Delays by closing agents in remitting sales proceeds cost <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> over $ 16 million in fiscal year 1987,'' the agency's inspector general's office concluded after a nationwide audit of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s sales and acquisitions of single-family homes, one of numerous agency programs. The same report said records for the single-family program had discrepancies involving 38,000 properties and $ 834 million dollars. The inspector general's report, and related audits of closing agents in several areas of the country, were obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. They are receiving close scrutiny by law enforcement officials and members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as part of investigations in <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> mismanagement and influence-peddling during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years. The documents show closing agents, although required to wire <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> its money within a day of completing a sale, routinely held the money, in almost all cases at first for a few extra days and then, as the mounting indiscretions went unnoticed, for longer periods _ weeks then months and in many cases two or more years. `` During a 31-month period, the escrow company remitted $ 109 million of sales proceeds to <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> an average of 47 days late,'' a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> audit found. `` The delays cost <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> $ 1.1 million in lost potential interest income.'' That company, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Escrow Co. of <LOCATION> Downey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, made just one of the 1,576 payments it handled over the nearly three-year period on time; some were up to 258 days late, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> records show. The owner claimed he did not know about the payment deadline; <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> records show it was listed in his contract with the agency and had on other occasions explicitly discussed it with the company. <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Escrow, said in a telephone interview that the company disputed the findings of the audit but settled the case last year for $ 250,000. `` It was cheaper for us to settle it than to go into court,'' he said Thursday. A review of 37 cases in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, found that late payments cost the government more than $ 18,000. In <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, an audit of a onetime <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> broker found that he withheld payments, overbilled and paid himself advances from <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> money. When he died two years ago he was almost $ 73,000 in arrears to the government, and his widow later withdrew money from a <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> escrow account, according to department records. She has agreed to repay the money, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials say. In <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, auditors said <PERSON> Rick </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Lind-Davis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Real </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> failed to pay <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> $ 2 million and was late in remitting an additional $ 3.8 million from sales between August 1984 to November 1987, costing the government more than $ 320,000 in interest. Federal authorities still are trying to recover that money, according to <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials. Some of the agents mingled <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> money with private and other checking accounts, conceivably earning interest that should have been going to the government, according to documents. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> was not detecting the late payments because of sloppy or nonexistent record-keeping. Some office kept records on index cards; others had so few computers that workers had to go from the first floor to the ninth of a regional <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> office to use one. Many offices accepted slips requesting wire time to transfer money to <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> instead of actual transmittal receipts from closing agents _ many of whom never actually transferred the funds, the documents show.

<TEXT>
 The Reformation liturgy of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> will flicker briefly in a few hundred of the country's 11,000 Anglican churches on Sunday, the 500th birthday of <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranmer </PERSON>, architect of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s historic prayers. At <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Giles-in-the-Fields </ORGANIZATION>, off <LOCATION> Charing </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cross </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, a special peal of bells is planned and the rector, the Rev. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, will use <PERSON> Cranmer </PERSON>'s Book of Common Prayer as he does at all services. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> is one of the few clergymen of the state Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> who cling to the old prayer book that appeared in 1549, when <PERSON> Cranmer </PERSON> was archbishop of <LOCATION> Canterbury </LOCATION>. The traditionalists scorn The Alternative Service Book, written in contemporary English and published in 1980, which was ordered by the General Synod of bishops, clergy and laity ruling the church. The new book has almost entirely supplanted <PERSON> Cranmer </PERSON>'s. `` Rapid social and intellectual changes ... have made it desirable that new understandings of worship should find expression in new forms and styles,'' the editors wrote in the new book's preface `` I would n't think of using anything else but The Book of Common Prayer, and I have n't done so in the 51 years I've been a parson,'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said in an interview. `` I do n't understand why the old prayers were abandoned. If some people want something else, God bless'em, but not me,'' he said. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilmister </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Prayer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Book </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, which has campaigned to keep the old prayers for most of 20 years, said he doubted whether more than a few hundred churches would remember <PERSON> Cranmer </PERSON> on Sunday. `` <PERSON> Cranmer </PERSON> was a liturgical genius who encapsulated ... the Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s doctrinal standard, in a heightened English which has become timeless,'' <PERSON> Kilmister </PERSON> said. `` It is sad indeed that we have not found another <PERSON> Cranmer </PERSON> to write a modern prayer book. Perhaps it will take another 500 years,'' he said. <PERSON> Cranmer </PERSON>, as archbishop of <ORGANIZATION> Canterbury </ORGANIZATION>, dissolved King <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> VIII </PERSON>'s marriage to <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Aragon </LOCATION> in 1533 and crowned <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Boleyn </PERSON> queen The divorce was forbidden by <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> <PERSON> Clement </PERSON> VII, and <PERSON> Cranmer </PERSON> became <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s first Protestant archbishop when the king broke with <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and set up the Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> the next year. <PERSON> Cranmer </PERSON> encouraged the translation of the Bible from Latin into English, ordering a copy to be placed in every church, and directed the translation and ordering of the litany from Latin. He lived in turbulent times and died a martyr. <PERSON> Cranmer </PERSON> stood by during the king's purges and killings. He was hated by the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Queen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> I for trying to block her accession. Under pressure, he recanted his Protestant beliefs but finally defied the queen and went to his death at the stake in <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> in 1556. Archbishop of Canterbury <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> has publicly gone on record as regretting the ouster of the old prayer book, which he said was too hurried. <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Friday: `` <PERSON> Cranmer </PERSON>'s prayers have consecrated the souls of English-speaking people through the centuries and enriched our language. His sense of the majesty of God and the mercy of Christ never failed him. It was that which, with all his faults, made him a great archbishop, a true patriot and a sensitive Christian.'' <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> will open an exhibition about <PERSON> Cranmer </PERSON> at the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Library </LOCATION> on Oct. 26 and preach at a commemorative service in Westminster Abbey on Nov. 7.

<HEAD>New State Laws Crack Down Harder on Drinking, Drug Use</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MITCHELL LANDSBERG</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 New state laws that take effect around the nation this weekend will make life tougher for drug dealers, rapists, drunken drivers, drunken boaters, smokers and taxpayers. Children get a break in several states that are banning or restricting teachers' use of the paddle. But two other states are imposing a more diabolical form of punishment on teen-agers: taking away drivers' licenses. Laws in many states go into effect each year Jan. 1 or July 1, so this Independence Day weekend is seeing a layer added to the mounds of jurisprudence that have been piling up in lawbooks since before the states were united. Taxes are rising in at least five states, and the usual collection of eccentric laws are entering the books in others. It's now legal to produce caviar in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, but illegal for lobbyists to lend their credit cards to legislators in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. The gopher tortoise has a new and exalted status in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> _ it's the Official Reptile of the state The <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> blue crab is now the Official Crustacean of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, although its only official duty, apparently, is to get eaten. A survey of the 50 state legislatures suggests, more than anything, that lawmakers are growing more desperate about drug and alcohol abuse. <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> has doubled its fines for most drug dealing convictions _ the maximum is now $ 1 million _ and has authorized cities and counties to close or demolish buildings used in drug crimes. <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> is extending the death penalty to include murders committed during drug transactions. It also is requiring judges to impose special fines on drug dealers and giving police more authority to keep _ and use _ the property of dealers. `` Police were telling us they were busting drug dealers who had a lot of sophisticated equipment, such as mobile phones and two-way radios,'' explained <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Small </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. `` A lot of the stuff seized ... would be useful to police.'' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state is enacting a comprehensive, $ 80 million War on Drugs that includes stiffer prison terms and expanded education and treatment programs. <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> are imposing taxes on illegal drugs, a ploy that is intended to `` take the profit out of drug trafficking,'' according to <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. The new alcohol abuse laws are aimed primarily at keeping drinkers from operating vehicles _ on land, on sea and in the air. In <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, where drivers previously could sip alcohol behind the wheel so long as they did n't get drunk, drinking while driving is now a crime. A new <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> law allows judges to require drunken drivers to equip their cars with ignition locking devices that measure a driver's alcohol level. If it's too high, the car wo n't start. <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virgnia </LOCATION> have outlawed drunken boating, while <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> has strengthened its drunken boating law. And under a new law in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, airplane pilots can be charged with a misdemeanor if they fly within eight hours of drinking an alcoholic beverage. Several states changed their rape laws. Spouses can now be convicted of raping their partners in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. Rape suspects in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> have been given new ammunition to fight the charges against them _ they can introduce evidence in court about the sexual background of the alleged victim. Three states have decided to spare children the rod, at least at school. <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> effectively banned corporal punishment. <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> have enacted laws that hit delinquent teen-agers where it hurts _ in the driver's license. <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> high school students will lose their license if they're expelled or suspended from school twice in a year; <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> teens can be denied a license if they've been convicted of any alcohol-related offense. New laws in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> are intended to keep young people from smoking. The <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> law bans the sale of tobacco to minors; the <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> law strengthens similar legislation. <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> state Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON>, a pack-a-day smoker who's fought previous efforts to restrict smoking, said he strongly supported the new ban `` I do n't like to see anybody smoke,'' he said. Those who do smoke will be paying higher taxes in two states. The cigarette tax goes up by 3 cents a pack in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state and 4 cents a pack in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. But in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, a federal judge Friday issued a temporary restraining order blocking enforcement of a new law barring cigarette vending machines, intended by proponents as a way of further restricting sales to minors. Gas taxes are up in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. And <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>'s sales tax, which was already the highest statewide sales tax in the nation at 7.5 percent, goes up another notch to 8 percent

<HEAD>Communist Party Announces Investigation into Behavior of Members</HEAD>

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> celebrated its 68th birthday Saturday by announcing an investigation into how its members behaved during the recent protests for democracy. It said some could be severely punished. Thousands of people took vows as new party members in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>. Tourists flocked to the Gate of Heavenly Peace, which overlooks the square and was opened to civilians for the first time since the military crackdown last month. With the party's image at a new low because of widespread corruption and the crackdown, party leaders turned to aging veterans of the 1949 revolution to lead the internal investigation. Newly appointed party chief <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zemin </PERSON> told a gathering of several dozen semi-retired officials, most in their 70s or older, that they were expected to help in an `` earnest rectification extending from ideology to -LRB- party -RRB- organization.'' The meeting was shown on national television. Not a single youthful official was seen as the camera panned the room. Many of those present wore hearing aids or slumped wearily in their chairs. The party newspaper, the People's Daily, signaled in a front-page editorial that the shake-up would not be restricted to the party's top levels, where it began with the recent ouster of party chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> Some party branches, it said, were `` weak and lax, and did not carry out their roles as fortresses in battle.'' `` The recent turmoil ... severely tested every party member,'' the editorial said. `` It is necessary to strictly check on the performance of every party member in the struggle. `` Those deserving criticism and education should be criticized and educated, and those deserving sanctions should be punished,'' it said, adding that discipline should be severe. `` The strength of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is not in its numbers, but in the quality of its members.'' Since the army entered <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on June 3-4 and used tanks and machine guns to quell student-led protests for a freer society, party units have held frequent meetings to study the new party line defending the crackdown. However, there have been no reports of party members being purged on the grass-roots level. Many party members took part in the student-led marches, and punishment has been expected. The <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was founded in 1921 by a dozen men who gathered surreptitiously in a girl's school and had flee to a rowboat in the middle of a lake when police learned of the session. The People's Daily acknowledged that some Chinese have lost confidence in the party in recent years, partly because many members use their privileged status to sell favors or siphon off official funds. Strengthening the 47 million-member party is a `` matter of life and death,'' it said. The party also celebrated its birthday in a more lighthearted manner with dancing and singing in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, which was opened to organized groups that had obtained permission from authorities. The vast square, where students demanding reform staged rallies in April and May, was filled with people taking party vows and soldiers who sang, `` Without the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> there would be no new <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.'' The ornate 17th-century Gate of Heavenly Peace _ <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> _ overlooking the square was reopened to all civilians for the first time since the crackdown. More than 2,200 tourists, nearly all Chinese, flocked to the gate, getting autographs from Gen. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuyi </PERSON>, one of the army commanders who brought troops in to quell the protests. Plainclothes security men, wearing straw hats or holding walkie-talkies, stood along the marble railing from which <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>'s portrait hangs. The party's birthday celebration coincided with an American birthday party as the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy celebrated Independence Day early. As it does every year, the embassy threw a party American residents in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. But many Americans fled <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> when the army moved in, and only about 200 people attended the bash, compared with 1,500 last year. Eight Chinese police with submachine guns took up posts outside the embassy but refused to say why they were there. They may have hoped for an appearance by dissident <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON> and his wife, who are wanted by police and have been hiding at the embassy. Education officials, meanwhile, said more attention would be paid to `` political attitudes'' when approving student applications to study abroad, the official <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> reported. The step appeared part of a series of measures to prevent people accused of joining the protests from leaving the country. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> sends about 8,000 students abroad to study each year. Official newspapers also announced the start of the trial of three men accused of throwing paint May 23 on the portrait of <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> that hangs from the Gate of Heavenly Peace. The People's Daily said they were charged with counterrevolutionary actvities. The three _ a magazine editor, a teacher and a factory worker _ were turned over to police by student protesters who condemned the defacing. Authorities hung a new <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> portrait hours later. The trial, like most in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, was closed to foreign media.

 When <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zemin </PERSON> was named head of the world's largest communist <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, he inherited more than a powerful position _ he inherited a load of serious problems <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON>, successor to the disgraced <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, must deal with the aftermath of the government's suppression of the pro-democracy movement and with an economy slipping out of control. He also must live in the shadow of his two successors, the late <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON> and <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, both purged for failing to clamp down on the democratic impulses of youth. <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON>'s political future seems to rest on the health of 84-year-old senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> and the desires of other party elders who strongly believe in the communist ideology that has ruled <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for 40 years. `` It depends, as so much has in the last weeks, on what one old man decides to do. That's where it becomes unpredictable, because it's one old man,'' said an <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> already is being compared to <PERSON> Hua </PERSON> <PERSON> Guofeng </PERSON>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s titular head during the transitional years of political instability between the 1976 death of <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON> and the rise of <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>. There probably will not be more pro-democracy demonstrations in the near future like the one crushed when soldiers drove thousands of protesters from <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> on June 3-4. But the willingness of people to put up with political repression may be tied to how well the economy performs and to living standards. Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> last fall announced a two-year austerity plan designed to slow economic growth to curb inflation, running about 30 percent in urban areas. Industry was growing so quickly that it was taxing raw material and energy supplies. Also, banks were issuing loans for new construction and expansion without getting old loans back, adding to the inflationary pressures. <PERSON> Li </PERSON>'s plan has had modest success. The industrial growth rate has been shaved from about 20 percent last year to 11 percent, and inflation has dropped slightly. But factories ca n't pay their bills because credit has dried up, and exporters are reneging on contracts because they lack the raw materials needed for production. A deepening energy crisis is forcing factories to shut down for days each week, and severe shortages of some raw materials have contributed to rampant corruption. Factories often have to pay off officials who obtain materials at low state-set prices and resell them for handsome profits. Unemployment, which according to official estimates will rise to 3 percent from 2 percent this year, has caused great social despair. Millions of people, mostly peasants from the countryside, have been put out of work by the cancellation of construction projects and have been left to drift from town to town looking for work. Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON>'s economic measures have all but stopped economic reforms, particularly changes crucial to bringing prices in line with market values and easing serious supply-demand gaps. The purge of <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, one of the pioneers of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s market-oriented reforms, and his followers will deprive the nation of some of its most innovative economists. `` Economic thinkers will at best be under a cloud,'' said a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` There will be a lot less intellectual energy.'' Diplomats also speculated that <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> will, like Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, be more comfortable with central planning models that <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> tried to dismantle. That would not bode well for flagging efforts to restructure <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s economic base. In the first three months of 1989, before students took to the streets to demand political reforms, 22 percent of state-run enterprises lost money. The amount of losses, made up by the state treasury, was the equivalent of $ 1 billion, up 120 percent from the same period in 1988. Foreign businessmen who fled when the crackdown began now are returning, but the political turmoil could seriously affect <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s foreign business relations The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> says a travel advisory urging businessmen and tourists to stay away from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> remains in effect. One embassy official said safety concerns continue and cited a recent incident in which troops fired into the air when a car driven by an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> businessman backfired as it pulled away from a military checkpoint. <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON>, who worked to attract foreign investment to the city of <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, where he was party chief before his promotion, may have been picked by <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> partly to reassure the outside world that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will keep its doors open to the West. But new foreign investment, which <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> badly needs for its modernization drive, likely has been severely hurt by the crackdown. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> have urged international lending institutes to postpone new loans to protest the crackdown. Such a move would deprive <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> of billions of dollars in development money. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> has deferred consideration of $ 780 million in loans. Tourism also has been seriously hurt, cutting deeply into earnings of more than $ 2 billion a year that have helped <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> solve its chronic foreign exchange problems.

 The government lifted some restrictions on citizens who want to visit or emigrate to the West, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said Saturday. Authorities no longer will require that citizens receive invitations from family members if they want to visit the West, the party newspaper Rude Pravo said. It said an invitation can come from any Western resident, including emigres who left <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> illegally. Czechoslovak citizens still must apply for an exit visa when traveling to the West, it said. Another new measure eases difficulties faced by families who wish to move abroad to join relatives who have illegally left the country. A five-year waiting period had been required before a Czechoslovak could apply for emigration, but <PERSON> Rude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pravo </PERSON> said that restriction was dropped effective Saturday.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s oldest civilian employee, an 89-year-old engineer, has retired and is going back to <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where he launched a career in aviation that spanned six decades. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ries </PERSON> came to this country in 1928 and worked for 35 years for companies that pioneered in aviation: Fairchild, Convair, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, EDO Aircraft and for <ORGANIZATION> Fokker </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. He helped design pontoons for the planes flown by <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindbergh </PERSON> to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and by Adm. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> to the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pole </LOCATION>. `` I've enjoyed my work, all of it,'' he said sadly at a retirement ceremony at the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> on Friday. `` I will miss it.'' He said he would fly to <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, this weekend to live with his son, a civil engineer posted with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> there. The diminutive, soft-spoken <PERSON> Ries </PERSON> worked `` only'' 26 years for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, starting in 1963. Born in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, he joined the German air force during World War I, but he had n't completed pilot training when it ended. In 1928, he saw the onset of Nazism in his country and came to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. He became a citizen in 1930, the year he joined EDO on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> `` <PERSON> Lindbergh </PERSON> and his wife were flying to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and he wanted special floats outfitted to the bottom of the plane, with a motor in between, in case he landed in the water,'' <PERSON> Ries </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Lindberghs </ORGANIZATION> returned to EDO after their flight to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and had lunch with <PERSON> Ries </PERSON> and other company officials. `` I loaned him my pocket knife to cut his onions with, and I've still got that knife,'' <PERSON> Ries </PERSON> said Another highlight of his two stints at <ORGANIZATION> EDO </ORGANIZATION> was the design of an all-metal airplane designed to operate at 30,000 feet, a two-seater named the Model-R in his honor. The Depression caused the company to cut back work on it and the Model-R was never flown. In 1936, <PERSON> Ries </PERSON> went to work for Consolidated Aircraft in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, which later became Convair. From there, he and 20 other engineers and assistants were sent to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to help in setting up an assembly plant. After spending more than a year in the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>, he got a job at <ORGANIZATION> Fokker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Ries </PERSON>' European stay was cut short with the approach of World War II, and he returned to this country. A hands-on mechanical engineer, he admitted frustration with his profession's increasing reliance on paperwork, which he called `` letters to <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION>.'' `` I enjoy engineering. I think engineering is designing things, creating things,'' he said. `` But one thing we've turned to now is just writing specifications ... for somebody else to build something. I do n't like this.'' In recent years, he has designed training simulators for the controllers who explode Tomahawk and Harm missiles when they fail to detonate or go off course. He also is responsible for the design of a training aid for the military's newest torpedo, the Mark 50, which can be dropped from an airplane or fired from land or ships at sea.

 A horde of illegal aliens swarmed across the border from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but officials were n't doing a thing about the monkey business That's because the border-crashers were Japanese snow monkeys that escaped Friday from Parc Safari African, a zoo in <LOCATION> Hemmingford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>. As many as 100 monkeys swam a moat around the park and dashed south to the border, just a couple of miles away, officials said. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, animal control officer for the town of <LOCATION> Mooers </LOCATION> about two miles south of the border, said he started getting frantic phone calls Friday morning from residents reporting the monkeys on the loose.

 After weeks or months in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government custody, airborne Central American deportees finally had a leisurely meal and a choice: chicken or fish. There were no more guards giving them five minutes to eat at the crowded <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> detention camp near the Mexican border city of <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Aboard the <ORGANIZATION> TACA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> jetliner, they enjoyed courteous service from flight attendants. No more dressing `` like a carrot'' in the orange <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> detainee jump suits issued at the `` corralon'' _ the big corral _ their nickname for the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Isabel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Processing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. The 59 Salvadorans, Guatemalans and Hondurans devoured the airline food on the way to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. They clowned and laughed a lot for people who had spent everything for a better life in the north, and failed. The drudgery of detention made even the poverty and violence back home seem better. `` These are the unfortunate people, no money,'' <PERSON> Isidro </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, an officer at the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> immigration jail, said while overseeing their departure from the camp. `` The only place they got to visit in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> was this.'' They did not know when they would leave until their names were called on a recent day on the camp loudspeakers. <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> officials returned the clothes, money and few possessions the aliens had when apprehended, took a second set of fingerprints, compared faces with booking photos and herded them onto a bus. The INS <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> is the closest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> border crossing point to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The district spent $ 1.8 million last year to operate the detention camp, not including salaries, and another $ 425,000 on deportations, mostly on air fares to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The deportees included 668 Salvadorans, 317 Hondurans and 312 Guatemalans. Nationwide in fiscal 1988, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> deported 2,711 Salvadorans, 2,049 Guatemalans, 1,312 Hondurans and 36 Nicaraguans. On the seven-hour bus ride to <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, 22, lamented his failure to get a job in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> but looked forward to seeing his daughter born during his three-month detention. `` That's why it's not so bad to go back,'' said <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, an ex-soldier in the Salvadoran army. He said he fled his home in the eastern province of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguel </LOCATION> because he was desperate for work and because of threats from leftist guerrillas fighting the government. Few of the deportees had bothered to apply for political asylum in their appearances before an immigration judge because friends told them it was not worth suffering an even longer detention only to be turned down. Asylum is granted only to those judged to be fleeing political persecution. This group of deportees had a false start. Their bus had to turn back halfway to <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> because of flooding. `` Send the airplane here to pick us up,'' shouted <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Reyna </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintanilla </PERSON>, 24, another native of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguel </LOCATION>, when <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> officer <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> announced it would be impossible to get to the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> airport that night. `` I have bad luck,'' said <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Valencia </PERSON> <PERSON> Marin </PERSON>, 30, who lives near <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, wondering why he could not even get deported when he was ready. `` I was already looking forward to seeing my family again.'' The next day, the bus reached <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. The deportees arrived about 1:30 a.m. and slept on the floor of an area the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> leases in an industrial park near the airport. The airplane flight was the first for most of them. But not for <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Montufar </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON>, 29, a Guatemalan who spent the trip reading his Bible. It was his third time to be deported from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and his third plane trip. At the airport in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, the Guatemalans and Hondurans were transferred to flights for their countries. The Salvadorans waited in an immigration line near a wall with posters showing a little girl with one leg and the caption, `` Innocent victim of <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- guerrilla -RRB- mines. What about her human rights?'' The more than 30 Salvadoran deportees were told to wait at the immigration desk until the pilot brought their package of deportation papers. Then they were waved through, without interrogation or a search of their luggage by the soldiers downstairs in camouflage gear. Several had no money and stood in front of the airport bewildered, wondering how they would make it 20 miles to the capital and then home.

 Americans in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> celebrated an early Fourth of July on Saturday with a barbecue and imported beer but without the street dances and rock music that characterized previous years' bashes Only about 200 people showed up for the cookout on the patio of one of the three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy compounds in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s main diplomatic sector. That compared to the 1,500 who attended the block party last year. The 1988 bash featured rock bands as well as <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> hamburgers that the fast-food chain flew in from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> Many Americans fled <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> when <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> declared martial law in May and when troops moved last month to crush student-led protests for democratic reforms. At noon on Saturday, eight police guards armed with submachine guns appeared around the embassy complex but refused to say why they were there. They may have hoped for an appearance by dissident <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON> and his wife, who are wanted by police and have been hiding at the embassy. It was the first time in weeks that guards outside the embassy had weapons. Police guards with handguns are stationed outside each diplomatic mission in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, but since the military crackdown June 3-4, their holsters have been empty. `` I would n't read a lot into it,'' said <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, director at the embassy of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. `` Every time there's any kind of movement, the police presence is stepped up.'' The Chinese outside the embassy gate were police normally assigned to the embassy, according to a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> guard who said he knows them well. `` Same guys, new guns,'' the Marine said. The guards were stationed around the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> facility temporarily and will scale back their numbers after July 4, one of the guards said. About 70 police showed up at the Fourth of July party last year, diplomats said. `` I did n't think that was excessive,'' said one <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officer, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` They were there to keep Chinese from looking in at us through the bars, but they ended up looking at us through the bars.'' There was no extra security at the July Fourth party in 1987, according to diplomats who were in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> then.

 Anti-abortion activists anxiously awaiting a possible <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision Monday on abortion rights are gearing up for what they see as the next phase of their campaign _ war in the states. The National Right to <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which was winding up its three-day convention here Saturday, is hopeful the high court will, at the very least, return authority to the states to decide whether to restrict abortion. If that happens, there's a realistic expectation that <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, probably <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and possibly <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> could be among the first states to consider abortion curbs, said <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> <PERSON> Balch </PERSON>, the committee's state legislative coordinator. State action on abortion laws would depend on various issues, including timing _ many legislatures do n't convene again until 1990 or 1991. `` What we're talking about is an extremely long, hard struggle here,'' <PERSON> Balch </PERSON> said. A <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> case, <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> vs. Reproductive Health Services, is pending before the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and a decision is expected Monday. Missouri's law puts restrictions on abortions and defines life as beginning at conception. Upholding the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> law, or even parts of it, could reverse or seriously erode the 1973 landmark decision, <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, legalizing abortion. Many abortion opponents here believe a total reversal of <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> is highly unlikely. But they feel this court is their best chance since 1973 to return the issue to local lawmakers and, thus, give abortion opponents the chance to advance their goals on a state-by-state basis. Restrictive steps that <PERSON> Balch </PERSON> said would be most likely to be introduced are parental consent and notification laws, and measures to give fathers a say in abortion decisions. A parental consent law that was to have taken effect Saturday in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> was struck down Friday by a federal judge who declared the law unconstitutionally vague. Abortion foes say that if the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upholds even part of the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> law, it would be a victory and a signal to forge ahead. `` If it goes in any direction in our favor ... the first step you'll see is politically and legislatively a great push ... in all 50 states,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON>, a Franciscan brother attending the convention. `` The pro-life movement is just going to move forward and intensify.'' `` This is phase II,'' he said. `` The first phase was 16 years ago,'' when <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> was decided. `` It's going to be a state fight, whatever happens,'' said <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> anti-abortion activist and an architect of the measure before the high court. Abortion opponents already are talking about special legislative sessions, petition drives and increased lobbying efforts. `` The legislators are feeling the faint heat coming down the pike and it's just getting hotter,'' said <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Hucks </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION>. `` They're -LRB- also -RRB- going to feel heat from pro-abortion folks and the media. They'll be in the spotlight.'' Lawmakers `` have had some easy dodges,'' said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Mall </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. They'd say, `` ` Call me when we can start doing something.' Now, they're going to have to come out of the closet one way or another.'' The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> said in a June report that both legislative houses in nine states _ <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> _ along with the city council in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, favor keeping abortion legal. The report also said 24 legislatures favor making abortion illegal and governors in 15 of those states support such actions. But abortion opponents wo n't make such distinctions. `` We're not counting any state as a loss,'' said <PERSON> Jacki </PERSON> <PERSON> Ragan </PERSON>, head of the committee's state organizational developmental department. `` We're not counting any state as a given. All will be battlegrounds. We're going to give it all we've got.'' They also say they're braced for the possibility of defeat _ but remain undaunted. `` We're not about to pack up and go away,'' Miss <PERSON> Hucks </PERSON> said. `` We're in it for the duration. It's more than a passing interest. It's a bone-deep commitment.'' `` It's our belief that whatever the result in the <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> case, that the decision in <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> is in fact doomed,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bopp </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the committee's general counsel. `` It is simply a question of when it will be reversed, whether it will be in this case or the next case or the next case. But it is inevitable.''

<TEXT>
 Tourists on Saturday climbed atop the newly reopened Gate of Heavenly Peace overlooking <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, mixing with plainclothes police and crowding for autographs from a general whose troops crushed student protests on the square. About 20,000 civilians and soldiers earlier celebrated the 68th birthday of the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in the vast and immaculate square, which thousands of soldiers captured June 3-4 from students and supporters demanding democracy. The gate reopened to the public today, but those in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> needed the approval of martial law officials. In the square, thousands of people were sworn in as party members. Groups of helmeted soldiers marched by, holding AK-47 machine guns in their white-gloved hands. Hundreds sang a children's song that has been heard frequently in the weeks since the crackdown: `` Without the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, there would be no new <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.'' More than 2,200 tourists visited the ornate 17th-century gate, which sits on the square's northern end and is the main entrance to the former Imperial Palace. Nearly all the tourists were Chinese, but the evening television news showed a couple identified as Americans. Chinese visitors paid $ 2.70 _ two days' wages for many workers _ gathered at the gate where revolutionary leader <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON> declared the founding of the People's Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on Oct. 1, 1949. Plainclothes security men, wearing straw hats and holding walkie-talkies, stood along the marble railing from which <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s portrait hangs Tourists crowded to get an autograph of Gen. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuyi </PERSON>, one of the army commanders who brought troops to quell the student protests that the government called `` counterrevolutionary rebellion.'' Other tourists jostled for autographs from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Vice Mayor <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> <PERSON> Baifa </PERSON>, who accompanied <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>. Many crowding for autographs said they did not know <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> or <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> and were just following the others. A woman from the northeastern province of <LOCATION> Liaoning </LOCATION> who arrived in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> two days ago said she did not know what had happened in the capital, where official reports say about 300 people died in the military crackdown. Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence sources say the death toll could be as high as 3,000. `` Everybody says it is all right now,'' she said. A woman from eastern <LOCATION> Shandong </LOCATION> province claimed she did n't even know the protests and crackdown had taken place. Her only interest was in having another traveler take her picture atop the gate. Vehicles and bicycles were allowed to drive around <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> but were not allowed to stop. Students demanding democracy, press freedom and a clean government demonstrated in the square for seven weeks until the military crackdown. Officials say there was no firing inside the square itself and that no deaths took place there, but student witnesses dispute this. The Monument to the People's Heroes inside the square, which the students used as a podium during their protests, was draped Saturday with two long crimson banners proclaiming, `` Long Live the <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'' and `` Firmly Support the Communique of the Fourth Central Committee.'' It was at the party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s fourth session last weekend that party Secretary General <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, who sympathized with the students, was ousted.

<HEAD>Botha Says Farewell to Military in One of Last Public Appearances</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> addressed a military awards ceremony Saturday in what was expected to be one his last public appearances before retiring. The 73-year-old leader, reportedly embittered over pressures from his own political supporters to quit, kept his emotions in check in a farewell to the South African Defense Forces, with which he has been associated 23 years. But his voice cracked when he said, `` I thank you and greet you. God bless you,'' at the end of the ceremony. He awarded medals to 21 soldiers for bravery in the conflict against guerrilla forces in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has agreed to grant independence to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, its colony for 74 years, under a regional peace accord that also provides for <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> to draw its 50,000 troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. The Cubans backed and helped train fighters of the <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which battled South African forces <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s appearance at the ceremony came two days after he declined to attend a congress of his governing <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, where delegates approved a reform that envision giving the black majority a greater voice in national affairs. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> suffered a stroke in January. Party officials cited this as one reason for replacing him as party chief and urging him to step down as president after parliamentary elections in September. While not referring directly to the party's reform plan, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> declared that the country was `` involved in conflict on a front much broader than just the military. We are called on to stand up and be counted _ for our national values and interests, our traditions, religious freedom, private enterprise and our very right to exist as a free nation. `` We know the measure of our freedom depends on our sense of responsibility and devotion. The whole of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> can benefit from it.'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> served as defense minister before becoming prime minister and then president. Armored personnel carriers, long-range artillery and other pieces of military equipment were displayed in a two-hour parade past the reviewing stand in front of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>'s city hall, where canopies protected the dignitaries from the rain. Col. <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Stempsler </PERSON>, chief spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, denied press reports the event was arranged especially to bid goodbye to <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>. He said it was an annual event.

<TEXT>
 A former <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> intelligence analyst who defected to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> killed himself by inhaling carbon monoxide, and his last wish was to be buried in his <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> uniform, official media said Saturday. In providing details for the first time about <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Souther </PERSON>'s death June 22, the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said he `` went to the garage, started his car, closed the garage door and lay down on the back seat of the car leaving the door half open. The car filled with carbon monoxide.'' His body was discovered the next morning when he failed to appear for a ride to work, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The Communist Party daily <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Souther </PERSON>, 32, was considered a top Soviet spy. `` He belonged with such outstanding soldiers of the invisible front as <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Philby </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Blake </PERSON>,'' <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> intelligence officers who spied for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Souther </PERSON> defected in 1986 when the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> began investigating him and joined the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> secret police, the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>. When he defected, the <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, native was working as a satellite photograph analyst at the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s 2nd Fleet headquarters in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. Pravda said he had access to `` the most valuable documents on the top secret plans for use of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> in a nuclear war against the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and other socialist countries. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> described <PERSON> Souther </PERSON> as a `` man with a great soul, a romantic who was very impressionable and sensitive.'' It said as an intelligence officer, he lived under constant strain. `` He had a nervous breakdown,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Souther </PERSON>, who took the Soviet name <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Orlov </PERSON> after he defected, wrote a letter to his colleagues at the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> containing his last request, according to the news reports. `` Justice demands you hear my last words. I do not regret our relationship. It was a longstanding one, and helped me grow as a person,'' the letter said. `` I wish to be buried in the uniform of an officer of the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>.'' Neither <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> nor Pravda said whether the request was granted, but <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> chief Gen. <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kryuchko </PERSON> said on Wednesday that <PERSON> Souther </PERSON> was given a military funeral Monday. Previous Soviet news reports said <PERSON> Souther </PERSON>'s parents traveled to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for the funeral. Pravda said <PERSON> Souther </PERSON> had become disillusioned with some aspects of life in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and that his colleagues noted he suffered occasional bouts of depression. `` Of course, not everything <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> met in the Soviet land was as he had expected,'' the newspaper said. `` For example, he could never comprehend that it is possible to drop into a store and be unable to find some needed item.''

 Barbecues are easier. Still, devoted <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Englanders </LOCATION> scramble for the right seaweed, the right rocks and the right canvas for a traditional July Fourth clambake. And a couple of hundred enthusiasts have even been willing to spend $ 50 and head back to college to learn how to do it right. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, 48, said he signed up for the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rhode </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION>'s clambake course because last year he had a July Fourth clambake for about 100 people and it was a disaster. With roughly $ 1,000 invested in food, they salvaged what they could and `` boiled it on a propane stove,'' said his friend, <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, 32. In contrast to a barbecue, which in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> may simply involve throwing steaks onto a portable grill, a clambake requires a pit with white-hot rocks on which a mix of seafood is steamed or baked with potatoes, corn and other ingredients. Many people hire commercial bake masters. `` To have a clambake that does n't work is very embarrassing,'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said. The course, offered for three years through <ORGANIZATION> URI </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Narragansett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Classroom </LOCATION>, is hardly a typical academic experience. While students arrive with pen and paper _ one even brought a video camera so he would n't forget a thing _ they also brought suntan lotion and cold beer. Nonetheless, `` They're really into it,'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said. `` People are here to learn how to do clambakes.'' About 200 students have taken the non-credit class in the seven times it has been offered, said <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Hickox </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bay </PERSON> <PERSON> Classroom </PERSON> coordinator and assistant director of URI marine programs. It is usually a full class, she said. At 9 a.m. on a recent Saturday, on a hill overlooking <LOCATION> Narragansett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, class began. `` The water was calm, the sun was up and the beach was empty. It was gorgeous,'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said. Class began with a study of tide charts to determine where and when to collect the seaweed that will cover the rocks. Preparation of the pit was next, then how to coordinate the fire and rocks. `` He taught us what rocks to use and what rocks not to use. I was n't aware of it,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. The wrong type of rocks break apart under the intense temperature of the steaming food and release the heat. There was `` a lengthy dissertation on seaweed,'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said. `` One can be used and is very effective,'' while the other type does n't generate enough steam to cook the food without scorching it. `` The trick is to keep the seaweed from burning. You want it to boil,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. It's also important to get untreated canvas to cover the food as it bakes. `` I'm really amazed it's as scientific as it is,'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said. `` I guess there are a lot of things that can go wrong.'' The class assignment was to find the right seaweed. So 20 students headed to the beach. `` You should have seen us collecting the seaweed down there,'' said <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaudreau </PERSON>, 45, of <LOCATION> Marlborough </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> `` I thought eight -LRB- bushel -RRB- baskets would take us a couple of hours, but it only took us about 20 minutes.'' The steamers were purchased, as were mussels, fish fillets, lobsters, sausages, sweet and white potatoes, corn on the cob, and onions. `` My family did clambakes ... years ago, but I never paid much attention to it,'' said <PERSON> Roberta </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, 49. `` I've never put one on myself. That's what I'd like to do.'' A lot of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Englanders </LOCATION> are fascinated with the mystique of a traditional clambake, <PERSON> Hickox </PERSON> said. `` What this does is allow them to do something that appears very complex in their own back yard. While the food cooks, the students sample clam chowder and crab cakes made earlier in the day. Less than an hour later, bake master <PERSON> Thad </PERSON> <PERSON> Gruczka </PERSON> tests the cooking time by sticking a knife in the nearest potato. `` If the potatoes are done, the bake is done,'' said <PERSON> Gruczka </PERSON>, chairman of the science department at <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kingstown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. Final exam _ the taste test. `` When it comes to seafood, there just is n't any better eating than a bake,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Creighton </PERSON>, 19.

 President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> has agreed to release an American photographer captured while traveling with Moslem guerrillas, a senior <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> official said Saturday. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> gave the assurance that <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> would be freed in response to a personal appeal by <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s special envoy, <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalid </PERSON>. `` He told me that there will be no trial and that <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> will be released shortly,'' <PERSON> Khalid </PERSON> told reporters. He said he met <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> and that the American was in tears when he learned of his imminent release. Diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> might be released when <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> visits <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> this week to try to mediate a settlement in the Afghan civil war. `` He is no more in jail or being interrogated. He is in a house,'' said <PERSON> Khalid </PERSON>. He did not elaborate. <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, who did not have a visa to enter the country, was arrested by Afghan security forces on June 8 at a rebel hideout in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. He has not been formally charged with a crime. The 43-year-old native of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, had been covering the war between <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s soldiers and the U.S.-backed Moslem guerrillas, who are based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. He was on assignment for <ORGANIZATION> Time-Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> when he crossed into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> with the insurgents, known as mujahedeen or, Islamic holy warriors. The guerrillas have been fighting to overthrow <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s Marxist government for 11 years <PERSON> Khalid </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the nation's capital, on Thursday to discuss a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> proposal to end the fighting. The proposal calls for an immediate cease-fire and peace talks. `` If we can bring them to the negotiating table, that will make at least the beginning,'' he said. The guerrillas have refused direct talks, insisting that <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> and key members of his government relinquish power. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> has said he will not step down until he has guarantees that his departure will bring peace to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Solidarity Decides to Wait Before Taking Stand on President</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Solidarity legislators decided Saturday against offering <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> as a presidential candidate because the political system is not yet democratic enough, a spokesman said. The opposition lawmakers also decided to withhold taking a stand on the communist party's choice for president until just before the meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, which will choose the president. That meeting is expected sometime this week. The legislators said it would be best if there were more than one candidate. `` We are waiting for decisions of the coalition around the Polish <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- communist -RRB- Party as to what candidate it will recommend. Or rather what candidates,'' parliamentary deputy <PERSON> Bronislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON> told state television after the meeting. The leader of the communist party, Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, announced Friday he did not want to be a nominee and he endorsed Interior Minister Gen. <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>. The party has asked <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> to reconsider. Solidarity legislators met Saturday to decide what stand to take in relation to the election. `` As goes for the candidates from the coalition -LRB- communist -RRB- side, we will assume our stand on the eve of the election _ that is on the eve of the first session of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>,'' Solidarity parliament deputy <PERSON> Janusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON> told a news conference. During the daylong debate, Solidarity considered putting up its own candidate. The obvious choice would be Soldidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON> said, but he added, `` The time is not good for <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> now.'' `` We are not in a democratic system and we do n't think that <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> should be the president in this system which is not fully democratic,'' he said. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said in the past that he would not run for president. The president, who is limited to two six-year terms, will be commander-in-chief of the armed forces and be responsible for foreign relations. He may dissolve <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> for new elections and declare one 90-day state of emergency. The Sejm, or <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will convene in separate sessions for the first time July 4. Their first joint session as the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> is expected later in the week. That is when the president will be chosen. Officials want the president in office before President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> arrives for a three-day visit July 9. The communist coalition has a 300-259 advantage, but there are some internal divisions. Communist party spokesman <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bisztyga </PERSON> said Friday a meeting will be held to choose between <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> before the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> meeting. Among the options considered at the Solidarity meeting were the possibilities of finding a party or neutral candidate the opposition could support. Some people at the meeting, including <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, said it would be best if there were several candidates, not one, said <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON>, who is also national spokesman for the Solidarity trade union. In an interview on state television Saturday, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said the president needed to be someone who could unite all Poles. <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> is linked to the 1981 martial law crackdown, in which thousands of union activists were interned. Solidarity was outlawed the following year. The communist party chief cited this association in the public eye as his reason for not wanting to be a candidate. <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> helped crush Solidarity after martial law, but he won back confidence from the opposition by leading the government in negotiations that led to Solidarity's legalization and the elections for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. The elections were the freest in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> since World War II and included opposition candidates for the first time.

 More than 150 abortion foes were arrested Saturday as activists on both sides of the issue took to the streets two days before the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> was expected to rule on a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> abortion law. Arrests reported Saturday morning included 103 in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and 40 in <LOCATION> Romulus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> McNitt </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> group, said more than 100 people protested for 2 -LCB- hours by kneeling or sitting in front of the doors of the Northeast Women's Center Police said the 103 arrested were released and will be charged later. He said they probably will be cited for defiant trespass. The center's acting administrator, <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Straus </PERSON>, said the center was scheduled to perform more than 30 abortions Saturday. She said several women decided to reschedule their appointments but no one canceled, but <PERSON> McNitt </PERSON> said one woman left with an anti-abortion counselor instead of going to her appointment. In <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, about 400 protesters, some favoring abortion rights and some opposed, descended on a clinic in the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> suburb of <PERSON> Romulus </PERSON>. The 40 persons arrested on trespassing charges were trying to block the entrance to the <ORGANIZATION> Northland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION>, said police Sgt. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON>. They were released and ordered to appear in District Court by July 17. No assaults were reported, he said. `` I believe we are here in the spirit of repentance to stop abortion,'' said <PERSON> Vickie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wixom </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION> `` I will never use physical force but will be here until justice prevails.'' Smaller protests were also reported in <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, with seven arrests at each city by early afternoon. In <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>, about two dozen protesters were still marching on the sidewalk in front of the Planned Parenthood clinic Saturday afternoon, and three police paddy wagons were on hand. The seven persons arrested earlier in the day were charged with disorderly conduct. In past protests at the site, the anti-abortion protesters have purposely been arrested en masse after sitting down at the building's entrance. But on Saturday, individual protesters were arrested as they approached women entering the building. `` We're just trying to tell them that we've got families to help them save their baby,'' said abortion protester <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>. Abortion supporters gathered across the street from the clinic in a counter-protest and solicited pledges for contributions based on the number of abortion opponents expected to be arrested. The pro-choice demonstrators said they hoped to raise $ 1,000 for Planned Parenthood. Seven persons were charged with trespassing in <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, for sitting in front of the doors of a medical center. They were released on $ 100 bond a short time later. They were part of a group of more than 50 abortion opponents who gathered to sing, picket and pray outside the center. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> was expected to issue a ruling Monday on a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> law that restricts abortion and defines life as beginning at conception, or hold over the entire case for new arguments during the 1989-90 term.

 The chairman's plan was simple: Let members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> load down the defense bill with so many pork-barrel amendments it would collapse under its weight. Such a bill never materialized. The committee did vote to restore money for the V-22 Osprey helicopter and F-14D Tomcat fighter by reducing spending for the B-2 stealth bomber. But it refrained from any other major additions and found the money by cutting other programs. Then _ against the advice of Chairman <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, D-Wis. _ the committee chose a $ 295 billion defense bill that reflected its own procurement priorities rather than those proposed by <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> `` A leaner, meaner version,'' <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> said a day after the Wednesday vote as he compared the final committee package to the $ 7.1 billion in add-ons members had originally sought. Members of the panel explained that their plan remained within <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION>'s budget numbers. They also expressed dismay with pressure to rubber-stamp a proposal crafted by a <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary just 39 days on the job. Rep. <PERSON> Curt </PERSON> <PERSON> Weldon </PERSON>, R-Pa., joined with <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foglietta </PERSON>, D-Pa., and <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisisky </PERSON>, D-Va., to save the V-22, the tilt-rotor aircraft that is manufactured by <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helicopter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helicopter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Textron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, Their amendment also restored money for the F-14D, which is built by <ORGANIZATION> Grumman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. To get $ 157 million for the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>' V-22 and about $ 1 billion for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s F-14D, the lawmakers reduced spending on the MH53 helicopters and canceled multi-year purchases of the E-2C and F @ A-18 aircraft. The other amendment approved by the committee provides about $ 1.2 billion for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and reserves by reducing $ 500 million in procurement money for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s B-2 and $ 524 million that had been earmarked for <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> aircraft spares and repair parts. <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION>, commenting in a statement the day after the vote, said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> wants to cut defense spending but does n't want to cancel any systems. `` We must not preserve the fiction that we can keep all the weapons and bases everyone wants and still spend less money,'' the <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary said. <PERSON> Weldon </PERSON> disagreed, saying his amendment `` does not affect the bottom line of <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION>'s budget.'' The <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Republican said it was unfair to cancel the V-22 on the eve of testing the aircraft, which is designed to take off like a helicopter and fly like a plane. `` I like <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> but he got advice from pencil-pushers,'' <PERSON> Weldon </PERSON> said. Rep. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, D-Colo., said that based on the dollar amount, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> `` got 95 percent of what he wanted. But the ranking Republican on the Armed Services panel, Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, criticized the vote, calling it a `` bad day for good government'' because the panel failed to face the reality of a budget crunch and allowed business as usual. <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> expressed the hope that this will change when the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> takes up the defense bill. But Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Dellums </PERSON>, D-Calif., who voted against the <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION> budget, objected to the `` good government'' argument `` It's incumbent upon me to exercise my judgment not acquiesce to the secretary of defense,'' <PERSON> Dellums </PERSON> said. `` I've been on the job more weeks than he. ... I've written nine military budgets.'' <PERSON> Dellums </PERSON> said there was some resentment among Democrats on the committee that the chairman suggested his `` own membership should not have a right to assess a budget.'' Only nine of the panel's 31 Democrats supported <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>'s amendment to accept the <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION> budget.

 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s famed five boroughs could someday become four. The Legislature, working into early Saturday morning in an end-of-session marathon, voted to give <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> residents a chance to say whether they want to secede from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. If Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> signs the bill, residents of the smallest borough might be able to vote in November 1990 on whether to take a bite out the Big Apple. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said Saturday he had n't decided what to do. Polls say <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> residents overwhelmingly favor secession, an issue tied up with a court-mandated restructuring of the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> city government. `` We did n't start out with the idea of leaving the city,'' said state Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Marchi </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> Republican. `` We just wanted to maintain our voice in the city. We did n't have anything against the city of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. I ran for mayor there twice.'' The secession movement gathered steam after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled in March that the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estimate </ORGANIZATION>, which governs city spending and construction, was unconstitutional because it gave <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>'s 400,000 residents equal representation to the more populous boroughs, such as <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, with more than 2 million people. <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> residents fear the city charter revision commission's plan for revamping city government will shortchange their borough. `` It would reduce us really to colonial status,'' <PERSON> Marchi </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said he believed the legislators' action was not an approval of secession, but simply a `` political statement. What they are saying is ` <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> ought to be protected.''' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said he shared those sympathies, but was n't sure how to go about providing such protection. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> is from <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> are the other two boroughs. Residents of <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> have never considered themselves true <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> residents, said <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Connelly </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> Democrat who shepherded the secession bill through the state Assembly. She noted, though, that the borough's more upstate character has lessened since the <LOCATION> Verrazano-Narrows </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> linked it with <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> and it began absorbing people fleeing high housing costs and other urban woes in other boroughs. Many leaders from the other boroughs, including Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, a Manhattanite, fear the loss of tax revenue to the city if <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> secedes. Lawmakers who opposed the bill also argued that all <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> residents should have the right to decide if part of the city should break away. `` It's fundamentally unfair to all the other residents of the city of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> ...,'' said <PERSON> Assemblyman </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Genovesi </PERSON>, a powerful <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> Democrat. `` I do n't think that anyone has considered the ramification of how it all works out.'' <PERSON> Connelly </PERSON> argues that <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> residents never had a say in the 1898 decision by the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> that made the island a borough of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The 1989 bill calls for <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> voters to decide two questions: whether <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> should break from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and whether it should form a county or city type of government. The legislation wo n't allow a secession vote unless a charter revision is voted on in a citywide referendum this November. Even if the secession decision is a long way off and by no means a certainty, it's already unifying a borough that's been the butt of jokes, <PERSON> Marchi </PERSON> said. `` There is a lot of excitement,'' he said. `` I'm telling you, it does n't make any difference _ rich or poor, black or white, fat or skinny. It does n't make any difference.''

He also warned of `` related consequences for society, for every family and every person.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s appeal follows outbreaks of violence in the republics of <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. Last year, ethnic clashes erupted in the republics of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. The most recent violence was in <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>. Four people died in the city of <LOCATION> Novy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Uzen </LOCATION> last month when rioters attacked immigrants from the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> region, accusing them of setting up private business and finagling privileges in housing and other benefits. In June, violence between ethnic <PERSON> Meskhi </PERSON> <PERSON> Turks </PERSON> and native Uzbeks in the republic of <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> left about 100 people dead, officials said. <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> ordered the migration of the Turks to the republic in 1944. In April, 20 Georgians died in clashes with Soviet troops sent in to end a a pro-independece demonstration. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, whose own policies of tolerating greater openness and dissent have emboldened groups seeking more autonomy, blamed ethnic violence on the forced migrations of ethnic groups ordered by his predecessors. `` Today, we are reaping the fruits of lawlessness in preceding decades _ the deportation of whole peoples from their lands and the burying in oblivion of the national intersts of small ethnic groups,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. He said that all people had to obey the laws of the land that guarantee a citizen's rights and warned that `` the state will uphold these rights by all means at its disposal.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said some people were taking advantage of ethnic frictions for personal gain. `` This is playing with fire. Those who have embarked on this path are assuming gravest responsibility before their own people and before society as a whole,'' he said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said most of the violence had taken place in instances where ethnic groups constitute a minority in small communities. `` What will happen if interethnic discord spreads over to regions where millions of people of other nationalities live along with people of the indigenous nationality?'' he asked. He said every citizen regardless of nationality should have their rights protected, ethnic groups should be allowed to freely develop their own language, and culture and political and ethnic reform is needed in the 15 Soviet republics. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members and intellectuals should use their influence to quell ethnic passions. `` All of us indeed can not but be disturbed by the interethnic intolerance, frictions and even conflicts eupting lately, now here and now there, disrupting people's lives and resulting in a number of cases of human tragedies,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>New Cigarette-Machine Ban Gets Last-Minute Reprieve From Judge</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-New Laws, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Provisions of a new <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> law prohibiting cigarette vending machines were put on hold by a federal judge, less than 12 hours before the law was to have taken effect Saturday. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Senior Judge <PERSON> Aldon </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> issued a temporary restraining order banning enforcement of the challenged section of the law after an emergency hearing Friday `` Sales until this matter is resolved will be the same as under the old law,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> ruled. Four vending-machine companies had filed suit against the state Friday morning, requesting that the Adolescent Tobacco Prevention Act, passed by this year's <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, be declared unconstitutional. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s ruling prevents the vending-machine provision of the law from taking effect for at least 10 days. The vending machine ban, which won widespread support from lawmakers, is aimed in part at curbing uncontrolled access to cigarettes by minors. It would prohibit all cigarette vending-machine sales except in bars, private clubs or offices and other work areas not open to the public. A second hearing was scheduled for July 7 to determine whether a preliminary injunction should be issued until the law's constitutionality can be tested The plaintiffs claim a ban on vending machines will drive them out of business without restricting sales to minors any more than current law, which already requires employees of businesses having cigarette machines to check customers' ages before enabling the machines to work by remote switch. The restraining order presented `` no threat of change in the sale of cigarettes to minors'' since a cashier must still check the age of the person buying cigarettes, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. The judge made his decision despite the state's claim the lawsuit is not a proper question for a federal court. `` We do not feel there is a constitutional issue and therefore the plaintiffs can not prevail on the merits,'' said assistant attorney general <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Luinstra </PERSON>, who argued the case involved questions that should be challenged in a state court. But plaintiffs' lawyer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON> said the law deprives his clients of business without any rationale. `` There is a public interest in having children not smoke,'' he said. `` There's no public interest in having adults buying cigarettes hand-to-hand over the counter instead of having adults buy cigarettes from a machine after the business owner determines they are adults.'' Over the past week and before Friday's ruling, many of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>'s vending machine companies were busy removing cigarette machines from restaurants, hotels and other public places in anticipation of the new law

 When <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Alsobrooks </PERSON> was hired as an animal technician at a research laboratory here, nobody told him the monkeys he'd handle likely would carry a virus that could kill him. Less than three months later, one of his co-workers is dead, a former co-worker is hospitalized and <PERSON> Alsobrooks </PERSON> and about 30 current or former colleagues are on an experimental anti-viral drug they hope will stem the rare disease in case they, too, have been infected. The herpes B virus, better known as the monkey virus, is found in more than 50 percent of rhesus monkeys, a type of macaque. The virus is harmless to the animals, but more than half of the 30 cases documented in humans since the disease was first reported 57 years ago have been fatal. It's commonly transmitted through bites and scratches. `` I try not to worry about things I have no control over, but my family is worried. My mother is lighting candles,'' said <PERSON> Alsobrooks </PERSON>, 33, whose blood test results were inconclusive. Thousands of these monkeys are being used daily in laboratory experiments nationwide. While progress is being made in the area of animal welfare rights, the conditions in which lab employees work are largely unregulated by federal or state law. Officials at <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> say they have complied strictly with guidelines set by the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and that the two technicians who were infected did not report their wounds. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> McGeorge </PERSON>, a 23-year-old technician, died June 20, just a few days after the virus was diagnosed. The hospitalized former employee, whose name is being withheld, is in serious condition. He worked at the company only one week before quitting this spring. Early detection was impossible since neither man reported his injuries, which is required by the company, said <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> X. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wazeter </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> IRDC </ORGANIZATION> vice president. When an employee reports being bitten or scratched by a monkey, a disinfectant is promptly applied to the wound to kill the virus, <PERSON> Wazeter </PERSON> said. Some employees said bites and scratches were so common and the pressure to complete studies so great that it was nearly impossible to report each wound to the company nurse. <PERSON> Wazeter </PERSON> denied there was pressure on employees to work fast and said reporting wounds is mandatory. He also denied allegations by several employees that the leather gloves used by monkey handlers _ part of the extensive protection gear _ usually had holes and took months to replace. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>'s guidelines, which are not enforced by any regulatory agency, were created two years ago after a herpes B outbreak in <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, killed two monkey handlers and infected two other people. Some current and former employees at the lab believe a high turnover rate, poor training, and heavy workloads played a part in the outbreak of the rare disease, which has been documented only 30 times since the first case was reported in 1932, said Dr. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> epidemiologist. The disease, which attacks the brain and central nervous system, frequently leads to encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain, and then to death. Since the virus has been documented, 16 of the 24 patients who have shown symptoms have died, <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> said. In one case in <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION>, the virus was spread person-to-person. Of about 135 blood tests conducted on current and former <ORGANIZATION> IRDC </ORGANIZATION> lab employees who had contact with the monkeys in the last two months, 81 were negative and five were inconclusive, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> officials said. The rest of the results are expected this week. The company, which employs 350 people, does animal research for medical, pharmaceutical, veterinary and agricultural companies.

<HEAD>Coast Guard Prepares To Release Damaged Tanker</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A Greek tanker that ran aground and spilled 420,000 gallons of oil in <LOCATION> Narragansett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> last week was inspected Saturday as its crew prepared to move it to a drydock for repairs, officials said. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s Lt. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said officials from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> inspected the vessel, the World Prodigy, to make sure there would be no problem bringing it into <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> for repairs. A tugboat was scheduled to arrive late Saturday night and the ship was tentatively scheduled to leave on Sunday, <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said. The tanker has been anchored off the south coast of <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> since it struck a rock on <LOCATION> Brenton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reef </LOCATION> on June 21, tearing two large gashes in its side and dumping 420,000 gallons of home heating oil near the mouth of <LOCATION> Narragansett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officer who conducted three days of hearings into the accident last week concluded the accident was probably caused by human error. The captain, <PERSON> Iakovos </PERSON> <PERSON> Georgudis </PERSON>, 43, has admitted he erred in not waiting for a pilot before entering the treacherous waters close to the mouth of the bay. A federal magistrate late Friday released the ship and <PERSON> Georgudis </PERSON>, who faces two federal misdemeanor charges he violated pollution laws. <PERSON> Georgudis </PERSON>' bail of $ 50,000 was wired to a local bank. A state grand jury is also considering charges against <PERSON> Georgudis </PERSON>. Magistrate <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagopian </PERSON> said he released the ship at the urging of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, which wants to see it repaired. <PERSON> Hagopian </PERSON> said his order would contain a provision that the ship be towed. <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, however, said the ship would move under its own power, accompanied by a tug, to <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipyard </ORGANIZATION>, on the site of the old <ORGANIZATION> Brooklyn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yard </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. He said h was not aware of <PERSON> Hagopian </PERSON>'s order. <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officials would be on board the ship, along with <PERSON> Georgudis </PERSON> and his crew, for the 20-hour journey, <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said.

 A former volunteer firefighter was acquitted of a series of arson fires that terrorized this community last summer, and residents say they are troubled once again. `` I think the town is going to be in turmoil,'' Fire Chief <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenison </PERSON> said after a jury in neighboring <LOCATION> Lancaster </LOCATION> on Friday acquitted <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> <PERSON> Lalumiere </PERSON>, 23. `` I'm scared, I'm scared of what's going to happen,'' said <PERSON> Kenison </PERSON>. `` I'm concerned that, because of -LRB- the verdict -RRB-, repercussions are going to happen, one way or the other.'' <PERSON> Kenison </PERSON> said the community of 800 again will be afraid of the fires that last summer had residents sleeping in shifts and guarding property with guns. <PERSON> Paige </PERSON> <PERSON> Matson </PERSON>, owner of the <LOCATION> Skywood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Manor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Motel </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Lalumiere </PERSON> once lived, said <PERSON> Lalumiere </PERSON>'s acquittal brings new problems. `` I'm scared for him, I'm happy for him,'' <PERSON> Matson </PERSON> said. `` I'm just praying that they do n't come after him again. <PERSON> Matson </PERSON> said she is afraid the fires will start once again `` because they have n't caught the arsonists. I think the fires will start up stronger.'' When <PERSON> Lalumiere </PERSON> was asked by reporters what he wanted to do first after eight months behind bars, he replied, `` Thank God.'' He said he will return to <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> and stay with a brother, <PERSON> Rene </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Coos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury reached its decision Friday in its second day of deliberations, ending a three-week trial. Defense lawyer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Quay </PERSON> said he was n't surprised by the verdict. `` <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> has a lot of family support in <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Lalumiere </PERSON> was charged with setting 11 fires and trying to set two others out of 26 fires in the <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> community. No one was injured in the fires, but they caused about $ 1 million in damage. They began with brush fires, but soon escalated to barns and homes. Most began in the dead of night at the rear of buildings. <PERSON> Lalumiere </PERSON>, described by his lawyers as slow, suffering from a learning disability and functionally illiterate, admitted he set the 13 fires and three others, but later recanted. His lawyers said the admissions were coerced. Three charges were dismissed before Friday. The state was `` disappointed, but we definitely feel the evidence went in as well as it could,'' said Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Serell </PERSON>. `` There is no evidence linking anyone else to any of the charges -LRB- that were filed -RRB- against Mr. <PERSON> Lalumiere </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Serell </PERSON> said. `` If any new evidence came to light, it would be pursued.'' <PERSON> Lalumiere </PERSON> is the second person charged and acquitted in the fires. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Coulter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a current <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> firefighter, was charged in October with one count of arson, later reduced to criminal trespassing. He was acquitted of the lesser charge in April.

 A tanker carrying badly needed fuel broke through <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s blockade of the Christian enclave, sparking a fierce artillery duel that killed three people and wounded 16, police said Saturday. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s main Arab rival, said it was ready to cut off vital arms supplies to the Christians to help Arab League peace efforts. There was no immediate reaction from <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> leader Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, the army commander and head of a <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> vying with a <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> to lead the government. The official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> quoted a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman as warning the Syrians not to `` take advantage'' of the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> move or `` commit any aggression against other parties in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' There was no immediate comment from <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. The Christians have relied heavily on the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> arms shipments, including T-54 tanks and multibarreled rocket launchers, in their confrontation with the Syrians and their Moslem militia allies. The <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> so far has failed to halt the fighting, which began March 8. The Syrians and their allies imposed the land and sea blockade on the 310-square-mile Christian enclave on March 14. The blockade has caused a serious shortage of gasoline and oil and has turned the once-bustling area into a ghost town. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s Cabinet has been buying gasoline abroad and shipping it to the Christian enclave in small tankers. Syrian artillery pounds the Christian coastline daily to stop the ships, and one was hit and set ablaze a few weeks ago. Police declined to say how much fuel was aboard the ship that made it through Saturday. A <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the `` small tanker ventured through Syrian shellfire'' Friday night to anchor in a small bay about 15 miles north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. He said the tanker unloaded its cargo of gasoline and sailed out before dawn Saturday. He declined to identify the ship. `` The Syrians opened fire at the departing tanker. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s gunners fired back to provide the ship with cover. The ship made it through the blockade and headed to <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, but the exchange escalated and spread,'' the source said. A spokesman for <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> refused to comment on the fighting. The casualties brought to 385 the number of people killed since the fighting began in March; 1,515 have been wounded. A police spokesman said Syrian forces were firing six shells and rockets a minute for some periods before dawn. The barrage hit the <LOCATION> Ashrafiyeh </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> <PERSON> Rummaneh </PERSON> districts of Christian east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, the coastline north of the capital and wooded valleys east of the waterfront where <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s artillery batteries are deployed, the spokesman said. He said <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s gunners retaliated with 155mm howitzer fire on Syrian artillery emplacements along west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s seaside boulevard and the mountains overlooking the city. The spokesman said the Christian gunners `` scored several direct hits on Syrian artillery emplacements in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>.'' Witnesses, speaking on condition of anonymity, reported seeing a Syrian army ambulance rushing to scene shortly before dawn. Syrian headquarters in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> refused comment. As the firing intensified around daybreak, families rushed for cover in underground shelters and basements. The barrage eased about 8 a.m. and police said hundreds of families left west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> for safer areas in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> in eastern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Police said a similar evacuation was reported in east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, with Christians headed for the mountains northeast of the city.

<TEXT>
 Neighbors of the uranium processing plant in <LOCATION> Fernald </LOCATION> said they were pleased with the government's proposal to pay a $ 73 million settlement in a lawsuit charging the plant polluted the environment. But leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Fernald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Residents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that the plant's owner, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>, must still be watched to ensure it continues to clean up the 1,050-acre site. `` We're not done yet,'' said <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the citizens group. `` It took us 4 -LCB- years to win this battle. This is just the first part. The next step is to get it cleaned up.'' Terms of the settlement, approved by <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> late Friday, will be the subject of a hearing scheduled Aug. 24 before <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spiegel </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. It calls for the government to pay at least $ 73 million and no more than $ 78 million. Mrs. <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, who lives two miles from the plant, said the settlement provides funds for medical monitoring of the residents and their children to track any adverse effects of radioactive pollution. `` For all of us, it's very important to have medical monitoring after all that we've been put through,'' she said. `` The biggest thing is that we've shown the world that the DOE is wrong, that what they did to these people was wrong.'' <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chesley </PERSON>, the lawyer who negotiated the settlement for the neighbors, said money is also included for studies to analyze the extent of cancer in the area and help residents detect it as early as possible. `` Early detection is early cure in cancer,'' <PERSON> Chesley </PERSON> said. `` Now we can afford an opportunity for everyone to have early detection.'' <PERSON> Chesley </PERSON> filed a $ 300 million class-action lawsuit in Spiegel's court on behalf of 14,000 people living within five miles of the 38-year-old plant where the government processed uranium used in making nuclear weapons The residents alleged in their suit that pollution from the plant 18 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> caused them mental stress and devalued their property. <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> presided over an unusual mock trial that ended June 15 when a jury's non-binding verdict recommended the residents be awarded $ 136 million. <PERSON> Chesley </PERSON> credited the mock trial for encouraging the settlement. The defendant in the case was National Lead of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, the contractor that operated the plant for the government from 1951 through 1985. The current operator, <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Materials </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, was not involved in the suit. <PERSON> Chesley </PERSON> said the settlement is significant because it kills the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> claim that National Lead of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> was not liable in the case because it took its actions on orders from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. Under the contract, the government was required to pay damages assessed against <ORGANIZATION> NLO </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyer <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. The Energy Department has admitted that the plant has released more than 300,000 pounds of radioactive uranium oxide dust into the atmosphere through faulty exhaust-air filters during its history. But the department denies that pollution from the plant has hurt neighbors' property values. `` A lot of that is hysteria,'' said deputy Energy Secretary <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>. `` There really was n't, judging by what I heard ... a lot of hard evidence of anybody losing anything _ as a matter of fact, almost none.'' If <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> approves the settlement, the government must deposit the money into four <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> banks no later than Oct. 15, said <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Roselle </PERSON>, one of the lawyers who represented the neighbors.

 Traveling shows featuring dwarf-tossing contests are the latest outrage dwarfs find themselves fighting to preserve their dignity and safety, officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday. `` Dwarf-tossing may help financially the person who does it. ... However, it tears down the structure and the esteem that little people are trying to gain,'' said association spokesman <PERSON> Ernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Ott </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> signed a state law last week banning the barroom sport, helping short-statured people fight a lingering perception that they are `` non-persons,'' <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Etten </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Ban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dwarf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tossing </ORGANIZATION>, said at the association's annual conference `` It occurs in a bar and a consenting adult little person allows a stranger in the bar to pick him up and see how far he can throw him. The persons in the bar get prize money for throwing him the farthest,'' Ms. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Etten </PERSON> said. `` The people in the bar ... all stand around laughing and think this is one huge joke,'' she said. Dwarf tossing and dwarf-bowling, in which a helmeted dwarf strapped to a skatebard is used as a human bowling ball, have been made part of traveling entertainment shows and have been reported in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, she said. Efforts to outlaw the practice in several states are under way. The association also issued a statement opposing the use of bone-lengthening surgery to make dwarfed children taller. The association said bungled surgery has crippled patients and forced amputations. A record 1,000 dwarfed people and their families were expected at the conference that began Saturday to attend clinics on medical treatments, watch a dwarf fashion show, compete athletically and dance nearly every night of the week. `` During the year, you go dancing with your husband and you're the only little person on the floor You end up with a jab to the right and a jab to the left,'' as well as curious stares, said conference co-chairwoman <PERSON> Dee </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. `` So, dancing is very important to us.'' <PERSON> Kristen </PERSON> <PERSON> Pohlman </PERSON>, 17, said dwarfs travel across the country to attend the conference because it is their only chance to socialize with others who understand and accept them. `` It's a dream world. It's a real shock when you get back home,'' said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Pohlman </PERSON>, who believes she is the only dwarf in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> `` It's hell sometimes. Once a kid in a toy store came up to me and said, ` Oh, you can talk.' She went up to her dad and said, ` Daddy, buy me one of those,''' she said. The association was founded in 1957 by entertainer <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Barty </PERSON>, an actor who recently was featured in the movies `` Willow'' and `` Legend.'' The organization bills itself as the largest national organization representing people of short stature. Most dwarfism is genetic, but it usually does not strike all members of a family, and it can be caused by more than 100 disorders, <PERSON> Ott </PERSON> said.

 A mother who made a tearful appeal on television for the return of a toddler who she said was snatched from a hospital lobby actually staged the kidnapping with a friend, police said. <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvan </PERSON>, 28, was arrested Friday and charged with filing a false report, and her friend <PERSON> Sonja </PERSON> <PERSON> Rijo </PERSON>, 33, was charged with endangering the welfare of a child, said a police spokesman, Sgt. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Galvan </PERSON> retained custody Saturday of 16-month-old Christian, who was returned to her unharmed about 12 hours after he was reported missing Tuesday, <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> said. `` The mother and friend planned the hoax kidnapping in an effort to make <PERSON> Galvan </PERSON>'s estranged husband feel guilty,'' <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> said. The husband was not involved, he said. <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> said inconsistencies in Ms. <PERSON> Galvan </PERSON>'s statements had aroused suspicions among police, who originally credited her television plea with persuading the kidnapper to promptly free the boy. The child was found by a passer-by on a sidewalk not far from the hospital where the alleged kidnapping occurred. The two women were released with orders to appear in court July 31.

<HEAD>Ship Reported Bound For Iran With Nerve Gas Ingredient Docks In Dubai</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An Iran-bound ship believed carrying chemicals used in making nerve gas docked in <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> Saturday and unloaded unidentified cargo, shipping executives reported. The 5,608-ton West German-flagged <ORGANIZATION> Seacrest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pioneer </ORGANIZATION>, which came from <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, was earlier reported by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> ZDF </ORGANIZATION> television network to be carrying thionyl chloride, a component used in manufacturing deadly mustard gas. <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> is a major transshipment point for Iran-bound cargo. <ORGANIZATION> ZDF </ORGANIZATION> said the ship would be stopped before reaching <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, quoting unidentified government sources in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>. But shipping executives reported no moves to seize the freighter's cargo in <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> Radio, monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, Saturday denied that a shipment of chemicals to manufacture chemical weapons was bound for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. It said the reports were perpetrated by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and indicated renewed <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> hostility toward the Islamic republic. West German prosecutors announced Saturday they opened a criminal investigation into the <ORGANIZATION> Rheineisen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Dusseldorf </LOCATION>, which reportedly contracted to deliver 257 tons of thionyl chloride to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The firm is run by an Iranian family. The shipping executives, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the <LOCATION> Seacrest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pioneer </LOCATION> discharged containers at <LOCATION> Hamriya </LOCATION>, the smallest of <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION>'s three ports. They said that at dusk the vessel would be reloaded with a new unidentified cargo and would prepare to sail back to <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>. They described the new cargo as `` normal containers'' but said they could not identify the goods being loaded. `` The discharged containers were stacked at the port without any apparent restrictions,'' one source said on condition of anonymity. `` The unloading and loading operations went smoothly to all appearances.'' The source also said port officials told him they had received no orders from the government to confiscate any of the cargo. The Seacrest Pioneer docks in <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> about once every two weeks on regular runs across the Indian ocean. Rheineisen Chemical Products officials said earlier they halted the alleged shipment of thionyl chloride that arrived in <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION> on Wednesday. They deny any wrongdoing and say they have government approval for the shipment to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> Saturday quoted an Indian government official as saying the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> government's <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> sold <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> 60 tons of thionyl chloride in March. The official was quoted as saying the chemical was shipped from <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>. He said the sale did not violate Indian laws because the chemical is a freely traded commodity often used in pesticides. But is also a component of so-called mustard gas, which is used in warfare because of its irritating, blistering and disabling effects. The reports follow an international uproar six months ago over the involvement of West German companies in building a factory outside <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said the factory would be used to make poison gas but <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> said the plant will produce pharmaceuticals.

 Police in mobile booking trailers arrested 235 people in a crackdown on gangs over the Fourth of July weekend. Of the 235 people arrested Friday night, 136 were suspected gang members, and the sweep was to continue Saturday night, police said. `` We want the good people in this community to feel your presence'' Assistant Police Chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rathburn </PERSON> told officers before they swarmed through gang-infested neighborhoods in the first widespread dragnet for drug-dealing street thugs since the highly publicized sweeps dubbed the `` Hammer'' last summer. Forty-nine of Friday night's arrests were for felony narcotics violations and two were for misdemeanor narcotics violations. Other arrests involved weapons charges, outstanding felony warrants and driving while intoxicated. There were 452 gang-related slayings in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in 1988, surpassing the 387 such killings reported the year before. Authorities blamed the record level of bloodshed on fierce turf and drug battles fought by well-armed street hoods.

<TEXT>
 Three of four <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> nuns, who barricaded themselves in a monastery nearly nine months ago to protest liberalization of their austere order, ended the standoff Saturday, a diocesan spokesman said. The fourth woman, whose temporary vows expired earlier in the year, remained in the infirmary at the Monastery of the <ORGANIZATION> Most </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blessed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virgin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carmel </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Paterson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diocese </LOCATION>. Five of the 13 Carmelite nuns at the monastery barricaded themselves in the infirmary Oct. 4, saying they feared eviction for protesting a new prioress' introduction of television and sweets. <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> said Saturday's action was a surprise. `` We're presuming that the realization finally hit them that if they wanted to save their vows, they were going to have to leave.'' <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> said the diocese had planned to deliver an order Monday demanding the nuns leave the monastery. The nuns had maintained they would not leave the building until they were ordered to by the Apostolica Signatura, the highest court of the Vatican. The nuns have twice ignored orders from lower-level <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, formerly Sister <PERSON> Teresita </PERSON>, was the only nun remaining at the infirmary Saturday. She hung up the telephone when reached by a reporter seeking comment. There was no answer at the main monastery number. The location of the other nuns was not known, <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON>, a lay person who has acted as a spokeswoman for the nuns, said she did not know where they went. `` This came as a total surprise to me,'' Ms. <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> said. `` I did n't know they were leaving.'' She said she spoke to the rebel nuns two days ago and they said they were frustrated the case had dragged on so long. The remaining nun had shared that attitude, Ms. <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> said. `` I ca n't imagine what they're thinking,'' she said. `` Unless their parents influenced them, but that's just a supposition.'' Ms. <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> said she had spoken with Sister <PERSON> Eliane </PERSON>, who lives in the monastery and has been a spokeswoman for the nuns. `` It's very disturbing,'' she said. `` We just do n't understand how this happened so quickly. Sister <PERSON> Eliane </PERSON> said in an interview last week that she believed the nuns would remain until the Apostolica delivered its ruling. `` I do n't see any movement or anything that they're leaving,'' she said. The last Vatican letter, received May 31, told two of the nuns to seek another monastery, informed one that her temporary vows had expired and allowed a 71-year-old nun to stay on the condition that she obey the monastery prioress. A fifth nun, <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON> <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON>, left the monastery March 19, citing health reasons. <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON>, then known as Sister <PERSON> John </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, served as the spokeswoman for the group when their case received international attention.

He said he and five other employees were fired two hours later when management decided to clamp down on the strike and stop broadcasting. The station has encouraged the poor to fight social injustice. But since April, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s conservative <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>'s Conference has fired a total of 10 of the station's 42 employees. It appointed the Rev. <PERSON> Arnaud </PERSON> <PERSON> Chery </PERSON> as station director in an apparent move to check the influence of radical priests and employees. `` For about three months the new heads of the station have been running it with an antagonistic spirit,'' which led the staff to strike, the employees said in a release this week. <ORGANIZATION> Chery </ORGANIZATION> could not be reached for comment Saturday. <PERSON> Ramarais </PERSON> said he did not notify police of the confrontation. In <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> police rarely respond to citizens' complaints; they could not be reached for comment.

 A Cuban court-martial formally indicted 15 high-ranking military officers on charges of high treason and trafficking in cocaine, diamonds and ivory, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s official media said Saturday. The 15, including former Interior Minister <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrantes </PERSON> and former major general and war hero <PERSON> Arnaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, were stripped of their rank and expelled from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> last week. They were formally indicted by the military court in a meeting late Friday and early Saturday, said the official <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latina </ORGANIZATION> news agency, monitored in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. If convicted, the 15 could face the firing squad. The news agency said the court reconvened Saturday afternoon. It said the proceedings were attended by the Cuban press and senior government officials but gave no details. Dispatches from <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> said the defendants belonged to a secret division of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> that smuggled medicines, hospital supplies and computers to circumvent a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade embargo. <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> <PERSON> Latina </PERSON> said the military prosecutor, Brig.

The accused made these claims before a separate military tribunal on Tuesday and Wednesday that stripped them of all rank and decorations and recommended a court-martial. <PERSON> Escalona </PERSON> was quoted as saying the 15 tried to damage `` the prestige of the Cuban Revolution and sully the image of the officers of the armed forces and those of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Escalona </PERSON> called drug trafficking `` an inhuman and criminal'' enterprise. `` The trial is being carried out with all procedural guarantees established by Cuban legislation and they -LRB- the accused -RRB- are represented by their corresponding defense counsels,'' <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> <PERSON> Latina </PERSON> said. The court was made up of three major generals. <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>, who was a much decorated war hero, took part or directed fighting in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> and served on missions in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and to help <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista regime.

 Wildcat strikes by an estimated 37,000 coal miners are threatening the health benefits of 85,000 retired miners and widows, the president of a coal industry group said Saturday. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Bituminous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operators </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> president, said in a statement that health benefits to retirees and widows are funded through hourly contributions by the coal companies. He said the wildcat strikes have cut off much of the fund's income. `` There must be an end to these strikes _ or the fund will collapse and thousands of people will lose benefits,'' <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said. The health benefits program cost $ 200 million per year or $ 4,000 per working miner, and the fund has lost $ 20 million since last year, <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said. Miners began wildcat strikes _ strikes without formal union sanction _ June 12 to protest the <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s refusal to sign a contract with the union and to protest the past jailing and $ 3 million fines levied against the union and its members. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON> could not immediately be reached for comment Saturday on <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>'s allegations. There was no answer at his home, and he did not return a message left at his office. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Knapp </PERSON> ordered the wildcat strikers back to work, but for the most part, his order has been ignored. Up to 46,000 miners had been out in 10 states, and as of Friday 37,000 miners in eight states were still out. About 1,900 <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> members are on an authorized strike against <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>.

 Police clashed with residents holding a community meeting in the black homeland of <LOCATION> Bophuthatswana </LOCATION> on Saturday, and nine officers and two civilians were killed, local news reports said. Officers in the town of <LOCATION> Leeufontein </LOCATION>, 150 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, were investigating an `` alleged illegal gathering when they were attacked by a large crowd of people with petrol bombs, axes and stones,'' the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> quoted police officials as saying. In an earlier report, the <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said the deaths occurred when police fired on the meeting with automatic rifles and people at the meeting retaliated. Clashes between local citizens and police have been reported in <LOCATION> Leeuwfontein </LOCATION> and nearby <LOCATION> Braklaagte </LOCATION> since they were incorporated into <LOCATION> Bophuthatswana </LOCATION> last year. In March, police in <LOCATION> Braklaagte </LOCATION> were accused of beating people who refused to declare themselves citizens of <LOCATION> Bophuthatswana </LOCATION>. Critics say such boundary changes in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> have deprived thousands of people of South African citizenship and the job opportunities and other advantages that go with it. Police Col. D.A. <PERSON> George </PERSON> was quoted by the <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> as saying he was unsure what the meeting in <LOCATION> Leeuwfontein </LOCATION> was about but that it probably concerned the incorporation issue. <PERSON> George </PERSON> said that in the `` unprovoked attack,'' four officers were trapped in a police vehicle and burned to death and five others were killed by stones and axes. The two civilians were killed by police gunfire when the officers tried to defend themselves, he said in a statement. <PERSON> George </PERSON> said an unspecified number of arrests were made and police were patrolling the area on foot and in helicopters. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Transvaal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> quoted a community leader, <PERSON> Dadelik </PERSON> <PERSON> Majasa </PERSON>, as saying police opened fire during the meeting, killing two or three civilians, and that four or five officers were killed when the crowd retaliated. Some of <PERSON> Leeuwfontein </PERSON>'s 1,500 people have gone to court to contest the incorporation on grounds it was done without prior notice. A similar legal appeal by Braklaagte involving 9,000 rural blacks was rejected by a regional court in March. <LOCATION> Bophuthatswana </LOCATION> is one of several tribal areas within <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> that the white-controlled government has encouraged to become nominally independent, a strategy that in effect helps control the size of the country's 28 million blacks. However, the homelands are not recognized internationally as separate countries. <LOCATION> Bophuthatswana </LOCATION>, located in the northcentral part of the country, has an estimated 1.7 million people.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, back at his beloved vacation home for an extended holiday weekend, spent a vigorous Saturday recreating by the sea, entertaining family and encouraging neighbors to watch his fireworks show Monday night. `` Beautiful day,'' he called out cheerily to neighbors out walking their dogs when he took his 6:30 a.m. jog on dirt roads near his family compound at <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>'s Point. The president was accompanied on the run by daughter <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBlond </PERSON>, first dog <PERSON> Millie </PERSON>, a couple of <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> agents and a reporter. He advised the neighbors he jogged past not to miss a fireworks display to be set off on Monday night over <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>'s Point, site of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> home. The president's five-day stay was billed as a mostly private time for recreation, but he said he would be going over briefing materials for the upcoming European summit. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was accompanied on the sunny holiday weekend by wife <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, some of his young grandchildren, and other relatives. After his two-mile jog, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> headed for the sauna and pool, and his daily intelligence briefing on world events. He then took his boat <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION> out on the sea, whizzing by the <ORGANIZATION> Shawmut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> just as White House Press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> finished telling reporters the president would have no other public activities for the day. However, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> later played golf at <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arundel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Golf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Course </LOCATION> with longtime friend <PERSON> Spike </PERSON> <PERSON> Heminway </PERSON> and club pro <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Raynor </PERSON>. As they teed off, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, wearing carnary yellow pants, was asked by reporters if he was getting tired from the day's activities. `` What do you mean?'' he asked, laughing. `` We're just beginning a five-day marathon.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> played 18 holes in less than two hours and credited his improved game to a new type of putter. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said there has been no resolution of the flap over who will pay an estimated $ 40,000 per year that local police must spend to accommodate the presidential visits. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been visiting <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION> since his boyhood, but new security demands since he has become president have prompted complaints from local authorities, and a letter from Sen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, seeking federal financial help. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the president wants to help and `` feels very strongly for <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>,'' but there is no legal way to spend federal funds to help the local governments. `` It would take an act of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that would allow us to give money for that,'' said <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, adding that he was unaware of any special federal help provided other small towns that have served as presidential vacation spots in past administrations. Meanwhile, crowds of tourists crowding the quaint, boutique-filled center of town appeared to be oblivious to the president's visit. One of the unsolved mysteries this weekend in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION> is the identity of the mysterious benefactor paying for what promises to be a spectacular fireworks show Monday night. The show will be produced by pyrotechnics specialist <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Zambelli </PERSON> who counts the president among his fans. The state fire marshall's office said the permit was issued in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s name at the request of the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, but no one is saying who will pick up the tab, estimated at $ 5,000. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said only that it is ` an anonymous donor.''

 A Soviet sailor granted temporary asylum in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was arrested Saturday after he ran naked through a coastal resort town with an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag in one hand and a knife in the other, police said. Before running through <LOCATION> Rockaway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Ptitskin </PERSON>, 19, went on a rampage that included smashing church windows and destroying church-owned equipment, said Police Officer <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Witt </PERSON>. `` We do n't know what caused it, but it looks like he just went bananas and started tearing things up,'' said <PERSON> Witt </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ptitskin </PERSON> was charged with first-degree burglary, criminal mischief and disorderly conduct, <PERSON> Witt </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ptitskin </PERSON>, the third mate of the Soviet fishing boat The Izmurudnyi, jumped overboard in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> on Wednesday, saying he wanted to `` try American.'' He told <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officials he wanted political asylum. The <PERSON> Izmurudnyi </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> on Friday bound for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.

A man threw a videocassette recorder, a computer and other electronic equipment belonging to the church through the window of a church-owned cottage. The man then ran next door to the church's recreation hall and broke two large windows. With an American flag draped over his shoulder and a large knife in the other hand, the man then went down the street to a motel and broke a large window near the office. <PERSON> Ptitskin </PERSON> was arrested in the lobby. <PERSON> Ptitskin </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Rockaway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, a town of about 1,280 people about 60 miles west of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, on Friday evening and was staying at a small church-owned cottage, said the church's pastor, the Rev. <LOCATION> Morton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. `` We went to dinner and talked about several things,'' <PERSON> Park </PERSON> said. `` He had no money and no luggage and he was in a strange place. I think he was under a lot of strees and that showed. I did n't expect this to happen, though.'' <PERSON> Ptitskin </PERSON> was being held in the <LOCATION> Tillamook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jail, where bail was set at $ 26,900. He was to appear in court Monday.

 <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s new military leader on Saturday pledged to end the 6-year-old civil war peacefully, promising to make contacts with rebels fighting the Moslem-dominated government. Twenty-eight army generals were fired. `` Our primary goal is peace, and we -LRB- the army -RRB- are the people mostly suffering from war,'' Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Bashir </PERSON> told a government meeting broadcast on official radio. `` I will enlist the help of all experts in the quest for peace.'' <PERSON> El-Bashir </PERSON> said the peace overtures begun last month by Prime Minister <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Mahdi </PERSON>, whom he toppled Friday, were `` political machinations and not serious.'' The war with the mainly Christian and animist rebels in the south has crippled the economy and led to widespread famine that has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives. <PERSON> El-Bashir </PERSON> led 15 military officers in the bloodless coup, the fourth military takeover in <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s 33 years of independence. The junta, known as the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, imposed a state of emergency, suspended the constitution and dissolved <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, political parties and unions. Hundreds of troops guarded the streets on Saturday, stopping and searching cars and manning barricades. Tanks and armored cars guarded the presidential palace, army headquarters and bridges spanning the <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nile </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nile </ORGANIZATION> that bisect the city. Telex and telephone communications with <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>, cut immediately after the coup, were restored. However, reporters wanting to send stories by telex were ordered to submit their copy for `` verification'' by officials. The new regime also imposed an indefinite ban on traveling abroad. The move was believed aimed at curbing the spending of badly needed hard currency. <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> reopened for eight hours Saturday for planes carrying Moslem pilgrims to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> for the annual pilgrimage, but it was closed to other international traffic. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> on Saturday became the first country to recognize the new regime. Relations were strained during most of <PERSON> el-Mahdi </PERSON>'s three years in power. <PERSON> El-Mahdi </PERSON> had accused <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> of meddling in <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s internal affairs by giving shelter to <PERSON> Gaafar </PERSON> <PERSON> Nimeiri </PERSON>, the president ousted in 1985, and approving <PERSON> Nimeiri </PERSON>'s political activities in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> In neighboring <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>, the official radio on Saturday welcomed the military coup, saying it was for the `` greatest good of <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> and the Sudanese people.'' <PERSON> El-Bashir </PERSON>, 44, consolidated his power on Saturday by sacking 28 army generals, including Gen. Fat ` hi <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>, the commander in chief, and Gen. <PERSON> Babu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nimir </PERSON>, the chief of staff and a reputed el-Mahdi The junta promoted el-Bashir from brigidier to lieutenant general. He earlier named himself prime minister, defense minister and armed forces commander. Sources close to the junta said the army detained dozens of political figures after the coup, but there were conflicting reports about <PERSON> el-Mahdi </PERSON>'s whereabouts. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported Saturday that el-Mahdi was in custody. The sources did not verify that report but said the army is holding <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Turabi </PERSON>, head of the fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Idris </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Banna </PERSON>, a member of the disbanded <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>; and <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Nugud </PERSON>, secretary general of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. At the meeting, el-Bashir put government undersecretaries in charge of ministries pending appointment of a new Cabinet. He said he would scrap the peace process begun by <PERSON> el-Mahdi </PERSON> and launch his own peace strategy, but he gave no details. In May, <PERSON> el-Mahdi </PERSON> opened peace talks with representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, led by former army Col. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Garang </PERSON>, the leader of the anti-government rebellion. The rebels demand more autonomy from the mainly Moslem, northerner-controlled government. One rebel demand was the permanent removal of harsh Islamic laws introduced by <PERSON> Nimeiri </PERSON> and suspended by <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> earlier this year. Talks were to have been resumed Tuesday in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, but the junta on Saturday indefinitely banned all official missions abroad. The talks were based on a tentative peace accord concluded in November and later endorsed by el-Mahdi under pressure from the army and the unions. Rebel leaders have not commented on el-Bashir's coup. Also Saturday, the junta released more than two dozen officers whom <PERSON> el-Mahdi </PERSON>'s government arrested two weeks ago and accused of plotting a coup. <PERSON> El-Mahdi </PERSON>'s civilian government took power in 1986, replacing a transitional military government that had been in place since the 1985 coup that ousted <PERSON> Nimeiri </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nimeiri </PERSON> last month said he would return from exile in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> and regain power. <PERSON> El-Bashir </PERSON> said in a statement on Friday that his coup had nothing to do with <PERSON> Nimeiri </PERSON>.

 A bus filled with workers ran off a road and rolled down a 900-foot embankment in <LOCATION> Natal </LOCATION> province Saturday afternoon, killing about 50 passengers and injuring 30, police said. The bus was returning black laborers and domestic workers to the independent black homeland of <LOCATION> Transkei </LOCATION> for the weekend when the accident occurred near <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shepstone </LOCATION>, 60 miles southwest of the coastal city of <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>.

South African <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Lew </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbet </PERSON>, traffic chief at <ORGANIZATION> Shepstone </ORGANIZATION>, as saying the bus left the road, overturned, and plunged down the embankment. The region experienced heavy rain during the day, but it was not immediately known if weather was a factor in the crash. Buses carrying workers frequently are overloaded and not well maintained. The reports said rescuers used four-wheel-drive vehicles to bring the dead and injured from the bottom of the ravine to the roadway. The injured were taken to hospitals in <LOCATION> Harding </LOCATION>, 11 miles away, with some serious cases taken to <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>. It was the second multiple-fatal bus accident in two days.

In the June 18 general election, <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> won 145 seats. The Coalition _ an alliance of the <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, disenchanted socialists and the <ORGANIZATION> Eurocommunist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Left </ORGANIZATION> _ won 28 places. Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Panhellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> PASOK </ORGANIZATION>, lost after eight years in power, taking only 125 seats. Late Saturday night, the 62-year-old <PERSON> Tzannetakis </PERSON> announced the first of his Cabinet posts. Only two of those he appointed _ the justice and interior ministers _ were non-parliamentarians affiliated with the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>. Most others were from the New Democracy Party. Named as deputy foreign minister was <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Papoulias </PERSON>, currently the envoy in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. In negotiations leading up to the agreement, <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Constantine </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON> had offered the Coalition the Justice and Interior ministries. The agreement came 40 years after the communists, in their bid to seize power, were defeated in a civil war by U.S.-backed government troops. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>, 70, who was in a hospital for treatment of a heart and kidney condition, reacted bitterly to the pact between the two political forces. `` This alliance is without principles. It violates the popular will,'' he said. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> had called on the Coalition to join <ORGANIZATION> PASOK </ORGANIZATION> so the two parties could set up a government. But Coalition leader <PERSON> Harilaos </PERSON> <PERSON> Florakis </PERSON> said he did n't want to be associated with a scandal-tainted group like the Socialists. A multimillion-dollar scandal allegedly involving key ministers in <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s government, and his open affair with a woman half his age while he was married, contributed to <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s downfall. <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Florakis </PERSON> agreed that their coalition would have a three-month life span and that its work would be limited to restoring democratic institutions and cleaning up Greek politics. <PERSON> Florakis </PERSON> said at the end of the three months, `` we will re-examine our position and act accordingly.'' But because of the wide gap in the two sides' political ideologies, it appeared unlikely the coalition could survive after its task of purging former <ORGANIZATION> PASOK </ORGANIZATION> ministers and officials accused of involvement in scandals. If the coalition falls apart, the president will appoint a caretaker regime to lead the country to natonal elections. A newly elected government is needed to deal with pressing economic problems and complete negotiations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> over the future of its four major military bases in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. The defense pact expired last December but a clause gives the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> 17 months to either close down the bases or renegotiate a new agreement. The two members of the new coalition differ over the presence of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases. The Coalition has strongly opposed the four bases and called for their removal. But the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> favors negotiating a new agreement.

<HEAD>Report: Technician Accidentally Erased Exxon Oil Spill Tapes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A former Exxon computer operator said he accidentally erased computer copies of thousands of documents on the Alaskan oil spill, according to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. An <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman confirmed the destruction, but said company lawyers believe other copies exist either on paper or in other computer files, the newspaper said in Sunday editions. Computer operator <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who worked at <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> office, told the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> it would be difficult and possibly impossible to determine which documents were destroyed. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, 33, was fired June 8, the day after the destruction was detected. He told the Times his superiors had been negligent in safeguarding the records, and said he contacted the newspaper because `` they are making me the scapegoat.'' However, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said, `` I have no reason to believe that anyone at <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> wanted these records to be destroyed.'' <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> has been under a federal court order to preserve the computer records and all other material concerning the March 24 shipwreck, oil spill and cleanup in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. At nearly 11 million gallons, it was the nation's worst oil spill. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said the company instructed employees to preserve documents, even before the court order, though no checks had been made to see if employees complied. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said no search had been conducted to determine which files were destroyed. `` When a court determines what documents are needed and appropriate, they will be produced,'' he said. The material destroyed included all internal communications from the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, owner of the tanker <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON>, and <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>'s executive offices, the Times said. As is their routine, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and other technicians spent three nights reusing month-old computer tapes, not realizing they were Valdez-related, he said. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said the tapes `` were not dated or marked ` do not destroy' as they should have been,'' and should have been stored elsewhere. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sussman </PERSON>, a lawyer representing fishermen, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> natives and others in a lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, said the incident means <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> may have been negligent `` even in the handling of its own documents.'' <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said that `` if these records have disappeared, it will be a substantial loss to any effort to reconstruct what actually happened.''

 Israeli troops shot and wounded 24 Palestinians Saturday, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said, including at least six mourners at the home of an Arab radical who kidnapped an American relief worker and was later killed by troops. The army confirmed six of the wounded and said it was investigating the other incidents. Also Saturday, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television reported that <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> embassies have been ordered to refuse to accept information from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other nations concerning their talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. The television quoted Energy Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Shahal </PERSON> of the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> as saying the order was an `` attempt to escape reality.'' In the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, merchants shuttered their stores and public transportation ground to a halt for the second consecutive day as Palestinians observed a commercial strike to protest <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s deportation of eight Arabs In the strip's Jabaliya refugee camp, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said, troops opened fire on a group of mourners visiting the family of <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> abu </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Nasr </PERSON>, a Palestinian who kidnapped <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> relief worker <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON> last week. <PERSON> George </PERSON> was released unharmed after almost 30 hours of captivity. The army said <PERSON> al-Nasr </PERSON> was gunned down last Wednesday by troops after he hijacked an Arab taxi. Arab reports said troops on Saturday shot tear gas and later live ammunition after dozens of mourners standing outside al-Nasr's home began throwing stones at soldiers. The reports said at least six Palestinians were wounded in the incident, including <PERSON> al-Nasr </PERSON>'s 60-year-old uncle, <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> abu </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Nasr </PERSON>. Arab hospital officials said three other Palestinians from Jabaliya were wounded Saturday, but could not say whether the additional wounded were connected to the incident at al-Nasr's home. Elsewhere in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, seven Palestinians including a 12-year-old boy and a 55-year-old woman were wounded by army gunfire, hospital officials said. The army confirmed one wounded and said it was investigating the other incidents. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, troops shot and wounded eight Palestinians in various clashes, Arab hospital officials said. The army confirmed a total of five wounded. At least 538 Palestinians have been killed and 12,000 wounded since the Arab uprising against Israeli rule began in December 1987. Twenty-three Israelis have also been killed. Leaders of the center-left <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said they will demand that Sunday's regular Cabinet session address the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s reported order to its embassies to refuse information from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or other countries on their talks with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> radio said Foreign Minister Director-General <PERSON> Reuven </PERSON> <PERSON> Merhav </PERSON> sent the order Israeli embassies Friday. A Foreign Ministry official refused to confirm or deny the reports but said embassies have standing orders not to receive such information. Last April, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> turned down an offer from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> to share infomation on <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s meeting with <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> considers the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> a terrorist organization and has refused all contact with its members. In another development Saturday, Israeli Arabs said the <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> has stopped recruiting them out of fear they might be too sympathetic to Palestinian protesters in the occupied territories. Police Chief <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Krauss </PERSON> told the Maariv newspaper Friday that the Palestinian uprising had `` penetrated deeply from the -LRB- occupied -RRB- territories to the Arab residents of the state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has about 750,000 Arabs living within its borders. Police spokesman <PERSON> Rafi </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> denied that <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> were being cut out of the recruitment because of fears of divided loyalties. `` The issue is simply that we are full,'' <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said. `` If there is an opening it could go to an Arab or a Jew. There will be no discrimination.'' Also Saturday, a Jordanian newspaper said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is limiting to 2,500 the number of Palestinians allowed to cross daily from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. The Arabic-language daily <ORGANIZATION> Al-Rai </ORGANIZATION> said the decision will take effect Tuesday. In previous years, as many as 4,000 Arabs a day were allowed to cross over the <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, according to Col. <PERSON> Abdul-Hafith </PERSON> <PERSON> Uteish </PERSON>, a deputy bridge director quoted by Al-Rai. The travelers are Palestinians who visit relatives in the occupied areas.

<TEXT>
 Chinese students burned a Communist flag before their homeland's consulate in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, and 5,000 people rallied in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> on the 68th anniversary Saturday of the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s Chinese students and scholars demonstrated in front of the consulate in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, denouncing <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> and other Chinese leaders as murderers. At <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION>, four Chinese students renounced their membership in the party. The rallies were part of a nationwide `` Democracy Day,'' during which participants urged an end to the crackdown on pro-democracy activists in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> that followed the army attack June 3-4 on protesters in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, about 50 Chinese, mostly university students from <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>, attended the noon flag burning at the consulate near downtown. `` Down with the Communist party! Down with the murderous party! Down with the old men's party! Rebuild a new <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>!'' the students shouted. They stuffed the red and gold <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> flag into a concrete waste can filled with burning copies of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, the official <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. They later distributed to the news media copies of a letter to be delivered to consul officials, expressing outrage over `` brutal suppression of human rights'' in their homeland and asking Chinese officials to declare pardons and amnesty for pro-democracy students. The letter also included a list of Chinese dissidents and asked the government for an account of their safety and whereabouts. Most students did not want to be quoted by name, saying they feared retribution by their government. `` These students are taking a risk by doing this publicly,'' said <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barbara </ORGANIZATION> professor <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Yuen </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizenry </ORGANIZATION> for a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION>, which organized the event. `` They are probably losing their chances to ever go back to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and could be putting their relatives still in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> at risk,'' he said. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, an 8-foot replica of the `` Goddess of Liberty'' statue erected during the pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square was unveiled in <PERSON> Justin </PERSON> <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Plaza </PERSON>, where politicians addressed an overflow crowd. The gypsum cement statue was built by Chinese students at the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, and is a model of a bronze one that community groups want to erect in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION> as a permanent reminder of the students who died when authorities used troops to quell the protests. In <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, the students resigned from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to protest the attack and the crackdown. `` We can not do many things to protest. This is one thing we can do,'' said <PERSON> Pan </PERSON> <PERSON> Youfang </PERSON>, 39, a graduate student in computer science who quit after 16 years of membership. Many Chinese students have preferred to keep their party membership a secret in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, fearing prejudice from Americans or the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, Chinese students said. He Zhou, 35, a graduate student in journalism, said the party advised <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> students not to admit their membership when they applied for visas to study in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Now, he said, the students `` identify themselves as communists only for the purpose of quitting.'' In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, about 100 Chinese students and supporters paraded with signs and banners in front of the downtown consulate. `` Let our voice be heard,'' said <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, a student representative at <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Evanston </LOCATION>. `` The people did not shed their blood in vain. A new page in Chinese history is now being turned.''

<TEXT>
 Opposition leaders filed complaints alleging fraud and a civic group pledged to monitor polling stations in <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, where voters elect a new governor Sunday. Elections also were scheduled in four other states. The gubernatorial, legislative and mayoral elections are viewed as a test of whether the goverment intends to keep the political process honest. The opposition planned to have pollwatchers at all 1,666 polling stations in <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> when the border state's 900,000 registered voters vote Sunday, <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday. In the other voting Sunday, state legislators will be chosen in <LOCATION> Zacatecas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michoacan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Campeche </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chihuahua </LOCATION>. Mayoral elections are scheduled in <LOCATION> Chihuahua </LOCATION>. Official results are expected in about a week. In <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the latest polls show a close finish between <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruffo </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, or PAN, and <PERSON> Margarita </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>. A poll published Friday in the <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jornada </ORGANIZATION> showed <PERSON> Ruffo </PERSON> at 33.7 percent and Ms. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> with 32.7 percent. Two leftist candidates stand virtually no chance of victory. If <PERSON> Ruffo </PERSON> _ a former mayor of <LOCATION> Ensenada </LOCATION> _ wins, the election would be the first gubernatorial race the <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> lost in its 60-year history. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s municipal committee in <LOCATION> Tijuana </LOCATION>, said Saturday he filed a complaint with the state election commission alleging that election officials were preparing to allow multiple voting with forged documents. Last week, the electoral commission burned 24,000 voting credentials, claiming many of them were falsified. Some people even use the registrations of deceased voters when they cast ballots. `` We can see if they are alive or dead. If they do n't come, they probably do n't exist,'' said <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> of the local electoral commission. Opposition officials say their members mysteriously disappear from the voting lists and are therefore unable to cast ballots. Hundreds of people waited all night Friday outside one election office to obtain their registration cards. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Amaral </PERSON> <PERSON> Munoz </PERSON> said the wait was worth it. `` I'm worried about the political situation in this country,'' he said. `` What's most important is that we decide through popular vote. Who wins must do so honestly.'' <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> <PERSON> Munoz </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> campaign committee in <LOCATION> Tijuana </LOCATION>, said 8,000 people still were not registered by Saturday. But <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> of the electoral commission said: `` We'll work up until the last minute so people can vote.'' <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> has promised an investigation into opposition charges that voter registration lists were padded in <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chihuahua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>, who took office in December, has vowed to clean up <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s politics. `` I have stated that I will uphold the law and that I will certainly practice it,'' <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> said recently. The president recently announced expensive public works projects for <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, where little more than one-third the voters cast their ballots for him in last year's presidential balloting.

<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Communist East <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> on Saturday denied allegations it diverted to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> millions of dollars in Western bank loans and that much of the money wound up in the hands of terrorists. The state-run <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> news agency, in a one-sentence dispatch, said the allegations `` do not correspond to the facts.'' <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said the statement came from `` the responsible -LRB- East German -RRB- agency.'' It did not elaborate. A former member of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, said a $ 600 million loan to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> ended up in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and that $ 60 million was given to terrorist groups in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, a senior director of national security planning from 1981 to 1983, said the loan was arranged by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and other Western banks in 1985. He said the money was traced by the highly secret <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which eavesdrops on international communications for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence operations. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said the deal was closed in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and that the money was first transferred to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>.

 A huge cargo plane that arose from the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> ice like a frozen phoenix after being buried in drifts for 16 years returned to its home base Saturday. `` Today we are celebrating a triumph: a triumph of technology, a triumph of knowledge and skill, and a triumph of courage,'' <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Talmadge </PERSON> said after the LC-130 Hercules and its nine-member crew landed. <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> engineers and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> personnel worked in subfreezing cold, heavy snow and windstorms for 42 days to excavate the icebound, 40-ton aircraft. The 98-foot-long plane was flown out of the crash site in January 1988 and was renovated in <LOCATION> Christchurch </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>. The LC-130 returned to its hangar at the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Antarctic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Squadron </ORGANIZATION> 6, the `` <ORGANIZATION> Puckered </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penguins </ORGANIZATION>'' who fly seven cargo ships owned by the foundation and used to supply its polar missions. The Hercules was abandoned in December 1971 at a remote site about 700 miles from <LOCATION> McMurdo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ice station on the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION>, after an aborted takeoff that damaged its landing ski and nose. The aircraft was designed for use in polar climates and has one-ton, Teflon-coated `` wheel-skis'' to break the grip of ice on takeoff. The loss of the Hercules hurt the foundation's ability to conduct field research in <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>, foundation officials have said. A salvage crew worked in minus 30-degree temperatures, heavy snow and 20-knot windstorms to excavate the damaged aircraft, repair it and fly it out. All but the top 3 feet of the plane's 38-foot-high tail had been buried in snow. The plane was made by <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Marietta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> engineers involved in the salvage found many hydraulic and electronics systems still working after the long hibernation There was still air in the tires and gasoline in the tanks, apparently preserved by the frigid temperatures and dry polar climate. Foundation officials say about $ 4.2 million was spent to excavate and overhaul the plane. The estimated cost of a replacement plane is $ 35 million.

<TEXT>
 At least three of the four people killed in the worst <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> fire in nine years would probably have lived if sprinklers had been required in the 27-year-old office building, the city's top fire official said Saturday. `` In this instance, I guarantee you there would n't have been four deaths if sprinklers had been in there,'' said Acting Fire Chief <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Perrin </PERSON>. The 10-story <PERSON> Peachtree </PERSON> 25th building, which housed 1,200 office workers including those from six federal agencies, was built in 1962 _ 12 years before city codes required sprinkler systems in new buildings taller than eight stories, <PERSON> Perrin </PERSON> said. No laws were passed to force the owners of older buildings to install the sprinklers, he said. Building owners `` say it costs too much, but how much are these four lives going to cost?'' <PERSON> Perrin </PERSON> said. `` You know there are going to be lawsuits filed in a fire like this.'' A series of powerful electrical explosions apparently set off when an electrical worker was changing a fuse triggered the blaze at 10:30 a.m. Friday. Much of the building was evacuated quickly, but a number of workers were trapped and broke out windows to escape choking plumes of smoke. They were rescued by firefighters using ladders, but one woman, 20-year-old <PERSON> Cassandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayward </PERSON>, leaped from a sixth-floor window to escape the fire. She suffered broken legs, a broken ankle and hand injuries and was in critical but stable condition Saturday at <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. Seven others remained hospitalized Saturday, one in critical condition. Sgt. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> with the <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> medical examiner's office identified two of the dead as <PERSON> Clifton </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON>, 29, of <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION>, a graphic artist with an office in the building; and <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinubu </PERSON>, 36, of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Tinubu </PERSON>'s reason for being in the building was not immediately known. Sgt. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Eskew </PERSON> of the medical examiner's office said autopsies revealed all four victims died of smoke inhalation, with the electrician also suffering severe burns. Investigators were puzzled about the identity of the woman. <PERSON> Eskew </PERSON> said no one had even telephoned authorities with a missing person report and she apparently did not work in the building. It was the worst <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> fire since 1980, when five people including four children were killed in an explosion at a day-care center. Although thick smoke rather than flames was likely to blame for the deaths in Friday's fire, <PERSON> Perrin </PERSON> said a sprinkler system would have `` certainly'' saved three people whose bodies were found some distance from the initial blast. Even the workman who was fatally injured by the explosion was able to stagger or crawl down a hall, away from the fire, and might have lived had a sprinkler system put out the blaze, he said. `` It might have even saved that fourth guy,'' <PERSON> Perrin </PERSON> said. `` I feel like we probably would n't have had any deaths if we'd had the sprinkler system.'' Fire officials were focusing their investigation Saturday on whether extensive electrical work being done in the building played a role in the fire and whether some of that work violated city codes. <PERSON> Perrin </PERSON> said an electrical contractor received a city permit in May to renovate the first floor, but fire investigators found evidence of large-scale work on the sixth and other floors. `` There were ladders in there, and they had heavy conduit pulled out,'' he said. Such work, without a permit, would be a violation, he said. The building is managed by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Torrance </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Komsky </PERSON>, vice president of the company, said an investigation would begin into the fire, but he would not comment on the lack of sprinklers. <PERSON> Komsky </PERSON> said the company is `` shocked beyond words at the loss of life and the injuries.'' Six federal agencies have offices in the building, located north of midtown <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, including the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>, Department of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. None of those offices is on the sixth floor, where the damage was the worst and where the people were trapped, <PERSON> Perrin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Perrin </PERSON> said he hoped the fire would result in legislation requiring sprinkler systems in all buildings beyond a certain height, regardless of their ages. He said he planned to send information about the blaze to congressmen interested in fire safety issues. There were reports by some agencies Friday that a fifth person had died in the fire, but <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said that stemmed from confusion over the unrelated death of a construction worker who fell from a construction site a few miles away, at about the same time as the fire.

 Undercover police officers posing as drug dealers arrested more than 1,700 people in a weekend crackdown on crack from the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION> to the Keys, officials said Saturday. Officers at times made nearly 100 arrests an hour, and it was expected the total could top 2,000 before the 48-hour operation concluded after midnight Saturday, <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's spokesman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Crolius </PERSON> said at the command center here Nearly 1,000 officers in 61 of the state's 67 counties participated in `` Operation Rock Pile,'' which was organized by the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriffs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` From now on, it's going to be war,'' said <PERSON> Broward </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheriff </PERSON> <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON>. By 10 p.m., the crackdown had netted 2,981 pieces of crack, nearly 10 pounds of cocaine and three pounds of other drugs, including heroin and steroids, <PERSON> Crolius </PERSON> said. Authorities also seized more than $ 44,300, 291 cars, a boat and 44 firearms, he said. About a third of the arrests were in the south <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> area from <LOCATION> Key </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pierce </LOCATION>, including <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Crolius </PERSON>. But authorities were surprised by the more than 320 arrests Friday and Saturday in the rural western Panhandle. `` We thought that most of the action would be in the cities,'' said <PERSON> Crolius </PERSON>. `` We did n't think we'd see that type of crack activity in the Panhandle.'' The effort targeted street-level crack users and dealers, the spokesman said. `` We want to send the message down to the streets that we are getting serious about crack,'' he said. `` We want to put the fear in the users that at any time they could be buying from a cop.'' Crack, a form of cocaine, is also known as rock.

 A 45-year-old woman who died after undergoing a session in a beauty salon tanning booth in order to treat a skin condition was not warned it could lead to dangerous complications, her husband has charged in a complaint. The ultraviolet treatment _ which was prescribed in tandem with a drug _ should have been done in a doctor's office or under tighter controls, the husband's lawyer, <PERSON> Saul </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruman </PERSON>, said Saturday. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> conducted an inquiry into the death May 24 of <PERSON> Patsy </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, but the agency did not recommend action against any individual or business, <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Danielson </PERSON>, investigator at the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> office, said Friday. Dr. <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beyer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chesterton </LOCATION> prescribed Oxsoralen-Ultra for Mrs. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> for treatment of psoriasis, according to a complaint filed Thursday with the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Portage </LOCATION>, took the drug two hours before receiving the ultraviolet treatment as prescribed by <PERSON> Beyer </PERSON>, according to the lawsuit brought by her husband, <PERSON> Julius </PERSON>. After a 25-minute session May 13 at <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON>'s Hair Loft in <LOCATION> Portage </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> suffered extensive burns and subsequent infection. She died 11 days later at a hospital in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` Tanning is ordinarily done in a doctor's office with meters which precisely measure the amount'' of exposure, said <PERSON> Ruman </PERSON>. `` She should n't have been sent out without the tightest of controls, or specific written directions,'' <PERSON> Ruman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Beyer </PERSON> does not have a listed home number and no one immediately responded to a message left Saturday on her office answering maching. Under <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> law governing medical malpractice lawsuits, the case will be reviewed by a panel of three doctors who will rule whether there was malpractice. If the panel decides there was malpractice, the plaintiff and defendant can negotiate a settlement and the plaintiff can also seek compensation from the state Patient Compensation Fund. The maximum from the doctor and the fund is $ 500,000, insurance department officials said. If the panel rules there was n't malpractice, the plaintiff can pursue the case in the civil courts.

 Demonstrators burned tires and barricaded streets Saturday during the funeral of a man who allegedly killed himself shortly before he was to be extradited to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Police fired tear gas to disperse the protest in his hometown of <LOCATION> Cotui </LOCATION>, 70 miles north of the capital. Two people were injured and 20 people were arrested, authorities said. Police said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirambeaux </PERSON>, 42, jumped to his death Thursday from the third floor of police headquarters shortly after being told he would be extradited to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to face charges he killed a police officer. President <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Balaguer </PERSON> on Saturday fired Police Chief Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Morillo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, who was reportedly with <PERSON> Mirambeaux </PERSON> minutes before his death. No reason was given for the firing. Police said Friday that <PERSON> Mirambeaux </PERSON> escaped from two guards who were escorting him from the police chief's office to the airport and jumped through a large hole in the wall near a third-floor staircase. <PERSON> Mirambeaux </PERSON> was buried in <LOCATION> Cotui </LOCATION> while youths burned tires and blocked streets with stones and tree trunks. A youth was injured by fragments of a tear gas canister shot by police to disperse the demonstrators, and one policeman was injured when a protester pelted him in the face, police said. <PERSON> Mirambeaux </PERSON>'s relatives blamed police for his death and said they doubted he committed suicide. On several occasions <PERSON> Mirambeux </PERSON> said he would rather die than return to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to face trial in the Oct. 18 shooting death of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> policeman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Buczek </PERSON> during a drug raid in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mirambeaux </PERSON>, who arrived in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> the day after <PERSON> Buczek </PERSON>'s death, was jailed in November for illegal possession of a pistol. A special investigating commission on Saturday began interrogating the two policemen who accompanied Mirambeaux from the police chief's office before he allegedly bolted and jumped from the third floor. The two officers have been suspended pending the investigation's findings

 Indians wearing feathered headdresses danced, a peace pipe was passed and ice cream was the hot item Saturday at the Party of the Century, marking <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>'s 100 years of statehood. The opening of the four-day centennial event was marked by speeches, a colorful Vietnamese dragon dance and the release of hundreds of balloons into sunny skies as the crowd sang `` Happy Birthday.'' `` This is a great idea,'' said <PERSON> Marianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Nesvig </PERSON>, a visitor from <LOCATION> Menlo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` It's a unifying effort. They really went all out.'' An estimated 15,000 people turned out, said <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>. During the festivities, six Indians wearing traditional clothing and headdresses performed the dances of their ancestors, beating on drums and chanting Indian songs. At one point, four Indians sitting in a circle passed a ceremonial peace pipe nearly 3 feet long among themselves, turning the pipe in a circle before handing it to the next person. With temperatures in the 90s, the ice cream booth quickly became popular. `` We're busy enough,'' said ice cream booth attendant <PERSON> June </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, trying to keep up with the line of customers. The Folklife Festival at the Capitol and other activities throughout the area and the state provided a way to celebrate the people and land of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Omdahl </PERSON> told a crowd of several hundred. `` We are here to properly recognize the development of a great state from a raw and rustic territory,'' said <PERSON> Omdahl </PERSON>, who was dressed in a top hat and tails from the 1880s. `` It's your centennial,'' added former Gov. Art Link, chairman of the state <ORGANIZATION> Centennial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which planned to spend $ 100,000 on the celebration it labeled the Party of the Century. `` You, the people of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, have taken the challenge and are demonstrating the commitment present 100 years ago,'' <PERSON> Link </PERSON> said. Organizers of the extravaganza expected up to 100,000 people would come to <LOCATION> Bismarck </LOCATION> and neighboring <LOCATION> Mandan </LOCATION>, which together are home to about 65,000 people, for the four-day affair. The Folklife Festival featured tents and booths displaying crafts, food and music representing all facets of the state's ethnic heritage. Sunday's festivities were to include a parade of horse-drawn wagons from <PERSON> Bismarck </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Mandan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> also begins its centennial year this week, and the year-long observance of 100 years of statehood starts with a long list of July events. Gov. <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> has proclaimed Monday to be Idaho Statehood Day, urging citizens to fly the flag and take part in local observances.

 About 80 Japanese monkeys were on the loose Saturday after escaping from their compound at a safari park, and some were sighted across the border in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> state </LOCATION>, zoo officials said. Officials discovered the monkeys had escaped Thursday morning, said <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyle </PERSON>, an owner of <LOCATION> Parc </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Safari </LOCATION>, about 56 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>. `` Apparently they managed to find or create a faulty hinge on the door'' to the compound where they were housed, <PERSON> Kyle </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. Most of them on Saturday were in a large wooded area surrounding the reserve, but 10 or 12 broke away from the group and made it over the border to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Some were seen by local residents and state troopers at <LOCATION> Perrys </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, a town three miles south of the park. The small primates, called snow monkeys, come from the mountains of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and weigh between 15 and 20 pounds. The animals are mischievous but not dangerous, said <PERSON> Kyle </PERSON>. Park employees formed a human chain to try to force the monkeys back into the reserve and stop them from reaching the border about a mile away. They also `` tried to entice them back into the compound by means of apples, oranges and bananas'' <PERSON> Kyle </PERSON> said, but the attempt was unsuccessful. `` Apparently they got lost or separated,'' said <PERSON> Kyle </PERSON>. `` The group includes males, females and babies,'' he said. `` They tend to stick together in groups led by one dominant male... They were all born in captivity, so that's in our favor too, they are not used to having to look for food themselves.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> publisher <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON> married <PERSON> Kimberley </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>, 1988's Playmate of the Year, in an outdoor ceremony Saturday afternoon as helicopters chattered overhead and photographers jostled for a better shot of the Playboy mansion. The 30-minute, non-denominational ceremony took place in front of the wishing well where the 63-year-old <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON>, perhaps the nation's best-known playboy, proposed to Miss <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>, 26 The wedding was heralded by the sounds of trumpets. About 200 guests, including actors <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON>, were on hand when <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON> tied the knot. The ceremony was conducted by <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ara </PERSON>, who `` brought comedic moments'' to the proceedings, said <PERSON> Bjay </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, a Playboy publicist. `` The grass is n't always greener on the other side,'' Ara counseled the groom. `` It's greener where it's watered. <PERSON> Hef </PERSON>, water the grass.'' The ceremony brought together top stars and culture magnates, but those interviewed declined to give it symbolic meaning. Asked if the gathering marked the end of an era, <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> said, `` I think it's the beginning of somebody's marriage.'' Motown records founder <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordy </PERSON> became flustered when asked if the sexual revolution was over. `` Ahhh, I do n't know,'' he stammered. `` I ca n't ... I ca n't comment on that.'' <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Keith </PERSON>, was the best man. Miss <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON> Resa </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, served as matron of honor and her father, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>, escorted her down a long, white carpet. Miss <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> wore a full-length gown designed by <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hjelm </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, with a drop waist and brocade bodice with a demure straight neckline. The chapel-length train was dotted with pearls. <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON> chose a 1940s-style look that included a single-breasted black wool tuxedo with black satin lapels and matching vest. A duplicate was made in case of an emergency, said <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Pallack </PERSON>, a haberdasher to the stars who has outfitted <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Sajak </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Danza </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Gretzky </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallone </PERSON>. `` It's a great honor for me,'' Pallack gushed. `` I mean, the man has worn nothing but silk pajamas for 30 years.'' Wedding guests munched on imported cheeses and smoked fish, and danced to a 25-piece band. The guests included former playmate <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> <PERSON> Tweed </PERSON> and her rock star husband <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, and actors <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Patten </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Culp </PERSON> and <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>.

I've had a bachelor party for 30 years, why do I need one now? <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> said the marriage captures the spirit of the 1990s. `` <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON>, the perennial bachelor, is getting married at a time a lot of his magazine readers are getting married,'' he said. `` The trend for the 1990s is commitment.'' <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON> was married once before, for 10 years to <PERSON> Millie </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, and they had two children _ <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>, 36, and <PERSON> David </PERSON>, 34. `` I am, most important, excited about it because he's so happy,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON>, who is chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION>.

 Hundreds of firefighters Saturday battled forest fires in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> that consumed nearly 10,000 acres. Officials were concerned about the potential for further blazes as thousands headed for parks for the Fourth of July weekend. More than 250 firefighters worked to contain four lightning-sparked blazes that had charred about 1,250 acres in bone-dry western and northern <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> by Saturday. One building was burned and people evacuated from more than half a dozen homes southwest of Grand Junction when the newest forest fire erupted. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, a new fire burned near the Sequoia National Forest as experts began restoring 8,200 scorched acres south of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, a 200-acre fire in the <ORGANIZATION> Ashley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Rough </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION>, 23 miles west of <PERSON> Duchesne </PERSON>, had been contained on Thursday but burst into flames again Friday when 20 to 25 mph winds from the southwest pushed the burning embers into fresh vegetation. Northwest of Rough Canyon, a blaze dubbed the Three-Mile Fire had blackened 300 acres. Eighty firefighters, ferried to the remote site by two helicopters, were on the lines. In <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Huntington </PERSON> said the newest fire, a 300-acre blaze in the <LOCATION> Glade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> area about 15 miles southwest of Grand Junction, was being battled with crews operating half a dozen fire engines, three air tankers and helicopters. `` Numerous other structures, homes and barns, are threatened,'' he said. He said the fire was noticed about noon, and within four hours had grown to 300 acres. <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's Capt. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> said all the residents of the satellite community near Grand Junction had been contacted and asked to evacuate. He did not know how many evacuees there were. The most damaging fire in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> consumed about 800 acres, but was about 70 percent contained in a small canyon about 10 miles north of <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Junction </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Keele </PERSON> <PERSON> Keeler </PERSON>. A 275-acre blaze in the Poudre Canyon northwest of <PERSON> Fort </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> was about 30 percent contained, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> said the fire threatened some structures near Rustic, but no property damage was reported. Firefighters believe they have the upper hand on a 175-acre blaze along a mountain ridge north of Dinosaur that began Wednesday, said <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. Authorities posted a high to extreme fire danger advisory statewide, and urged outdoor recreationists to use caution during the holiday weekend. Officials also warned against celebrating the Fourth with fireworks. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, more than 600 firefighters were on the line against a 227-acre fire south of the <ORGANIZATION> Sequoia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, said state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON>. `` It's in real steep, brushy terrain ... but there are no reports of high winds, which is helpful,'' <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON> said. Along with the firefighters, two aerial tankers and two water-dropping helicopters worked to douse the flames. The national forest and its preserve of giant trees were not in danger from the fire. No homes or other buildings were damaged or threatened, and there were no reports of injuries, <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON> said. The fire was about 150 miles north of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Firefighters planned to contain the <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elsinore </LOCATION> fire, which burned 11 homes, and left more than 8,200 acres scorched, including 1,000 acres of the <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. Nearly 2,300 firefighters were on the line earlier this week at the height of the blaze 65 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>.

 A man whose antiwar bomb shattered a five-story campus building said he regrets the 1970 blast killed someone but still feels he was right to protest the Vietnam War. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fine </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> student at the time, was among veterans of the 1960s protest movement who gathered this weekend for a reunion. He and three other men were put on the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s list of most-wanted fugitives after their homemade bomb damaged a campus building, killing a student and injuring several other people on Aug. 24, 1970. Several other people were injured. Fine, <PERSON> Karleton </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> and his brother, <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, were eventually arrested and received prison sentences. <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Burt </PERSON>, identified as the fourth participant, was never captured. The building had formerly housed the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mathematics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and was frequently a target of campus antiwar demonstrations. Fine and other participants denied intending to harm anyone. `` Regardless of why the bombing happened and the feelings people had about the center and the war in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, that in no way justifies the death and destruction,'' Fine said in an interview published Saturday. `` So I have a lot of regrets about that. Always have, always will, I'm sure,'' he said. Weekend events included discussion groups with topics ranging from Women in the 1990s to the Decline and Fall of Civil Rights. Fine, 37, who works in a law office in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, said he worried about what kind of reception he would get in Madison. `` I'm not going to come back and attempt to justify things I was convicted of which were very tragic,'' he said. `` I probably would n't contemplate doing something like that now under the same circumstances,'' <PERSON> Karleton </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> said. `` But for where I was at and where people were at the time, I thought it was right.'' The Madison native said he had no plans to attend the reunion but would be on the campus selling fruit juice from a stand he has operated for several years. <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Armtstrong </PERSON> is in prison in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> on a drug charge. Madison <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Frazer </PERSON> said <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> was dropped from the most-wanted list years ago but remains a federal fugitive.

 Striking <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> members blocked coal trucks and damaged two vehicles Friday in an attempt to halt shipments by non-union coal companies, authorities said. Gov. <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON> <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> said he had not heard from The <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, parent company of <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, about his latest offer to let the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> use his home or office for negotiations to settle the strike. `` They have obviously decided they do n't want to respond affirmatively to the letter I sent,'' <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> said, declining further comment. <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> twice in the past week has invited the two sides to meet in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> and settle the strike. The <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> has accepted both times and <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> now has rejected both offers. After a closed meeting of about 1,000 <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> members in <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> on Friday morning, about 150 miners drove to <LOCATION> Kenova </LOCATION>, where they blocked trucks trying to leave a non-union coal-loading terminal on the Big <LOCATION> Sandy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Many miners wore bandanas over their faces despite state law that prohibits West Virginians from covering their faces in public. State troopers showed up but made no arrests, warning to the miners of heavy traffic on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 52. About 1,900 <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> members are on strike against <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, and their strike that began April 5 has spawned wildcat walkouts by at least 37,000 miners in eight states. In <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> on Friday, bullets apparently were fired at a coal barge and a coal truck in <LOCATION> Walker </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>.

And with an eye to shootings and rock-throwing incidents that have marred the strikes in recent days, <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Pikeville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, banned strikers from setting off fireworks on the picket lines over the Fourth of July weekend. `` Just to preserve our image that this is a peaceful picket, it would be in our best interest not to have any fireworks on the picket line,'' said <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> Local 5737. `` The sounds could be confusing.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> strike began peacefully. But there has been scattered violence since the wildcat strikes began, including some shootings in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dial </PERSON>, the rigid, humorless anchorman on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>,'' is really a romantic at heart. `` The public side that he's developed is armor-plated,'' says <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimbrough </PERSON>, who ought to know. He plays the co-anchor on the show's fictional TV newsmagazine `` F.Y.I.,'' which also features <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Candice </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergen </PERSON> -RRB-, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Fontana </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Regalbuto </PERSON> -RRB- and <PERSON> Corky </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherwood </PERSON> -LRB- Faith Ford -RRB-. `` Inside he's a dreamer. He probably grew up reading <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Halliburton </PERSON>'s travel adventures and wanting to be just like <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murrow </PERSON>. He seems older because his values are those of an older time. It makes him uncomfortable to have to share the show with a former beauty queen like <PERSON> Corky </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherwood </PERSON>. `` He seems gruff with no sense of humor. But he can loosen up with his friends. ... The comedy comes from the fact that he's such a stiff. I have a fondness for that part of him that's loving and vulnerable.'' The thing <PERSON> Kimbrough </PERSON> says he dreads most is the comparison of Dial to <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON> on `` The <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> Show.'' `` <PERSON> Jim </PERSON>'s a good journalist. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON> was a very bad journalist. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON>'s a smart guy, <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> was pretty dumb.'' The role is the first real television exposure for <PERSON> Kimbrough </PERSON>. He has spent most of his acting career on the stage in regional and repertory companies, and got his `` big break'' with his Broadway debut in `` Cop-Out.'' He also was in `` Company'' and `` Sunday in the Park with <PERSON> George </PERSON>.'' `` I was mostly working in the theater and making money doing commercials. I'd occasionally do a movie or a part on television. When I was asked to do an audition tape for ` <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>' I figured it was just a ticket to oblivion. You sit in front of a camera and they put a bright light in your face. `` I loved the script and I wanted to do it. After the audition tape I walked in the rain, feeling very depressed. Three weeks later they asked me to fly to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. I found out I was competing against one of my best friends. They put us up in the same hotel and we laughed about it. We both wanted it a lot. I flew back to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and was doing a commercial on location in <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> when they called and said I had the part.'' <PERSON> Kimbrough </PERSON> grew up in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area, where his only early connection with the theater was an aunt, <PERSON> Emily </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimbrough </PERSON>, who with <PERSON> Cornelia </PERSON> <PERSON> Otis </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> wrote `` Our Hearts Were Young and Gay.'' The book about two young women traveling in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> was adapted for the stage, and was made into a movie in 1944. `` I grew up listening to music and doing a lot of drawing and painting. I went to <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> _ and I've never told this to anyone _ because they had a great opera department. I thought it would be wonderful to go to a school where I could go to the opera on Saturday night. `` I tried out for a school play and got a part. My grade average went from a ` B' to a ` C' overnight because I was closing the pizzeria every night with people who liked what I liked. `` I was in a lot of plays but it was too scary to call myself an actor. When I went to the <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> I took directing instead, but I spent most of my time acting.'' <PERSON> Kimbrough </PERSON> met his wife, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION>. After graduating they landed roles in `` All in Love,'' a musical adaptation of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON>'s `` The Rivals.'' `` I was making Equity scale and taking home $ 37.32. <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> was non-Equity and took home $ 10 a week. They paid us in cash so it seemed like more. After that we got out of the business for a while.'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> taught college and <PERSON> Kimbrough </PERSON> worked at a record club, but they both returned to the stage in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> version of a Julius Monk revue. That was followed by three years with the <ORGANIZATION> Hartford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and six in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>. Despite directing classes at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Kimbrough </PERSON> says he has n't spent much time in that capacity. `` I directed a few plays but I hated to be the unpopular one in the company. If you tell an actor what to do I'd always worry about it.''

<HEAD>Fireworks Booming For Now but Future Supplies Could Fizzle</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 While millions of Americans twirl sparklers, set off firecrackers and ooh and aah over Fourth of July fireworks displays, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> importers are getting headaches worrying about future festivities. `` There certainly is considerable concern for the 1990 season,'' says <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Conkling </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pyrotechnics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` Everybody is awaiting word from factories in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> about the status of future deliveries.'' So, before the last wisp of smoke has cleared on July 4, many fireworks firms will have placed next year's orders in anticipation of a possible shortage due to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s precarious political and economic situation. The Chinese, credited with inventing fireworks about 1,000 years ago, make the bulk _ more than 75 percent _ of the stuff <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumers use during Independence Day celebrations. Giving people such fleeting thrills as they get from lighting Roman candles takes <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies months of planning, negotiating and waiting for shipments _ even in the best of circumstances <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fireworks firms normally have their overseas ordering done by the autumn of each year to allow enough time for foreign factories to manufacture and ship the goods early enough for distribution in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> before July. Now, however, the uncertainty of Chinese supplies has companies scrambling to keep from being caught short next Fourth of July, by far the biggest time of year for the fireworks business. Current supplies should be enough to satisfy this season's demand; most imported Chinese fireworks had already arrived in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or left <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s shores before the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> government's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy `` The shipments for this year started arriving in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> back in November of 1988,'' observed <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, a fireworks expert at the Consumer Product <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. `` So the majority of them were already here or on the water.'' <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Grucci </PERSON>, a member of the family that runs one of the country's biggest organizers of fireworks shows, says intermediaries that handle his company's purchases abroad have advised <PERSON> Grucci </PERSON> not to panic. Nonetheless, the <LOCATION> Bellport </LOCATION>, N.Y.-based Fireworks by <ORGANIZATION> Grucci </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> expects a slowdown in Chinese production. `` We've already placed our purchase orders -LRB- to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> -RRB- now to try to beat the rush,'' <PERSON> Grucci </PERSON> said. `` We usually do n't make big orders until August or September to overseas.'' Firms like <PERSON> Grucci </PERSON> that specialize in aerial displays do n't rely on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> as much as companies do that primarily provide fireworks for consumer use. Besides what it imports from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Grucci </PERSON> supplements its own products with fireworks from numerous foreign sources including <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and other Far Eastern countries as well as ones in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Royce </PERSON> <PERSON> Trout </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Atlas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, a fireworks maker and importer that ships throughout the country, says manufacturing in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s northern provinces is more likely to be affected by political unrest than factories elsewhere in the country. This is because most of the turmoil seems to have flared up around <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s economically developed areas and educational centers, he says. Potential production snarls wo n't hit all types of fireworks. Factories assembling firecrackers, a highly labor-intensive task, mainly are located in the more rural part of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s southern provinces so firecracker shipments are n't likely to be disrupted, says Trout. Adding to problems that might arise from developments on the political front, <PERSON> Trout </PERSON> says he's been informed that several Chinese factories are facing financial trouble. A lack of credit to cover material and other costs has put three or four factories in <LOCATION> Hunan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION> in danger of closing. The southeastern province annually accounts for about 15 percent of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s total fireworks shipments to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which came to more than 50 million pounds in 1987, the most recent year for which <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government figures were available. Tightness in availability of one of <ORGANIZATION> Atlas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION>' most popular items probably reflects these financial difficulties. The item is a type of ground spinner _ a category of fireworks that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> created _ that spews fiery blossoms as it gyrates on the ground. Ground spinners are tubes packed with a an assortment of fireworks producing multiple effects. `` I'm very, very worried about what kind of supply we'll get from some provinces both from a political standpoint and a financial standpoint,'' says Trout. People in the fireworks business say there are only a few countries that could help fill a potential shortfall in Chinese shipments. And, there are limits to how much places such as <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Macao </LOCATION>, the Portuguese-administered territory off <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s southeastern coast, could compensate. <PERSON> Conkling </PERSON> of the pyrotechnics trade group says fireworks are an important export for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The country was becoming a powerful force in fireworks just before former President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> reopened trade with the country in the early 1970s. It has come to dominate the industry today, largely because its factories turn out products of acceptable quality at unbeatable prices due to low labor costs. `` Fireworks is a legitmate science in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> _ universities do research into pyrotechnics and fireworks and this translates into big business for the country,'' says <PERSON> Conkling </PERSON>. For years, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has kept fireworks prices down, very close to the cost of production, to attract customers. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses say that even before the political problems they were told to expect price hikes of 15 percent to 30 percent for next season's orders as the Chinese try to eke out more profit. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retail sales of fireworks will total about $ 200 million this year, the industry says. Government figures indicate <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> supplies about 76 percent by weight of all fireworks brought into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> but the industry says the figures probably understate Chinese imports. As <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s shipments have grown, the quality has been slipping, possibly because newer factories are n't as familiar with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> regulations. All imported fireworks must meet the same safety standards as domestically made products. Trout, who also is president of the industry's trade association, says the group has been working on a sort of self-regulatory program to promote consistent quality, partly to account for advances in fireworks since government regulations were written. Because of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s trade dominance, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry has been taking special care to see that the Chinese know what's expected of them. The industry is preparing an improved translation into Chinese of all the requirements, set down by several <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agencies. As part of the quality campaign, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry representatives had scheduled a trip to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in late July and early August. Now the campaign may have to be put on hold. `` We are quite concerned at this point as to how the situation in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will affect our efforts to get this quality assurance program in place,'' said <PERSON> Conkling </PERSON>. The meeting in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, he says, `` is very much up in the air at this point.''

<HEAD>Is There Anything Good About A Recession?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Recessions, or economic downturns of the kind Wall Street is now worrying about, have a terrible and well-deserved reputation. But is there anything nice to be said about them? Lots. They remove excesses like severe inventory pileups from the economy. They remind sellers that the consumer is still boss. They might even be accompanied by or cause lower prices and borrowing rates. What they do best, perhaps, is remind both sellers and buyers that the old law of supply and demand is still on the books. In boom times the seller usually has the upper hand; in bad times, the consumer ascends. This pervasive impact may have shown up already in lower housing and stock prices. And it could make even bigger inroads into the automobile market, which for a year has been fighting its own private battle with a slowdown. The automotive market, in fact, has been a display case of the strategies that come into play when the demand-supply balance is changing. Demand for cars has been ebbing for at least a year. Supply, however, has remained high. Under such conditions the suppliers must make concessions, which they did in the form of rebates and below-market borrowing rates. While the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> attempted to ease the economy into a slower pace by raising borrowing rates, the automakers sought to challenge them by lowering their own rates. It was a battle the automakers were destined to lose, because the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> had the ultimate power; it had the option of raising rates until it won its way. The automakers, in contrast, could lower their rates to zero, but not beyond. Conceding defeat, the automakers have sharply reduced production in an attempt to restore seller-buyer balance. Scheduled output for July is at an annual rate of 5 million units, or roughly half the annual selling rate. The question now is whether the balance can be restored in time to avoid price cutting. If demand remains low, the possibility exists that companies may be unable to reduce inventories sufficiently before new models are announced. If so, more automobile bargains might be available. Consumers will have won. Over the past year housing has also demonstrated the power of supply and demand. Demand was down, due to high prices and interest rates. In response, and despite a recent and probably temporary upturn, prices stagnated or fell. A housing market of that sort is a warning to makers of appliances, furniture and other items associated with housing, such as lawn products, to lower their inventories or else be forced to lower their prices. If a recession does develop, and there is still no proof that one will, there could other consumer benefits. Credit card issuers, for example, have clung to high interest rates, some of them charging more than 20 percent, preferring instead to attract customers through contests, low-cost merchandise, travel discounts and the like. However, such incentives lose their drawing power when people are in a recession mode, waiting and watching their dollars. The biggest incentive in such an atmosphere might be lower interest charges. Sellers of nonessential purchases might be forced to win customers through price cuts. Among them are airlines, resorts, hotels, various entertainment outlets and restaurants, all of which have been raising prices. Eating out, for example, already has suffered a hit, as economist <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON> points out. From 1982 to 1987, restaurant meal sales rose from $ 112.9 billion a year to $ 133.4 billion a year. They peaked at a $ 139 billion rate in January of this year; by May the rate was down 14 percent to $ 132 billion. When restaurateurs see figures such as these, they know what must be done _ cut prices. True, they have the option of dramatically improving the quality of food and service. But in a recession, price cuts are much better. Price cuts are nice, but not the recession that produces them. Most people, it seems safe to say without a survey, would opt for expansion and pay raises instead. That leads to the ultimate good thing to be said about a recession: It is the base for the next expansion, for more jobs, higher pay and lots of spending options.

 Investors have been pouring money into junk-bond mutual funds in recent months as interest rates available elsewhere have fallen, but they may be unaware of the danger lurking in these tempting, high-yield investments. `` Many people hear the word ` bonds' and they think ` safe, conservative,''' said <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Litvack </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investments </ORGANIZATION>, operator of one of the largest junk-bond funds. `` Junk bonds have a tendency to dance to a different drummer.'' That drummer is the state of the economy. Unlike investment-grade corporate bonds, junk bonds face a greater danger of plummeting in price in a recession. Junk bonds are bonds that carry a low credit rating as determined by credit-rating agencies. Their low rating reflects the fact that the companies that issued the bonds may be deep in debt or otherwise poor credit risks. Junk bonds also are used to raise cash for many leveraged takeovers, where the corporate raider takes on a great deal of debt in order to pay for the target company. In contrast, investment-grade corporate bonds are considered a conservative, safe investment because the issuing company is rated financially sound and considered able to meet its debt obligations even in a downturn. To make up for their extra risk, junk bonds pay a higher interest rate. Junk bond mutual funds have been yielding 12 percent or more recently, compared with about 9 percent for investment-grade bond funds and 8 percent for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond funds. <PERSON> Litvack </PERSON> said the assets of <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION>'s junk-bond mutual fund surged from $ 1.7 billion at the end of March to about $ 2 billion last week. While most investment companies would be happy to see their investment funds grow, Boston-based <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION> is concerned. It believes many of the new investors _ some of whom pulled money out of other, safer <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION> mutual funds _ do n't know what they're getting into `` Right now there is a misperception about what drives the performance of these securities,'' said <PERSON> Litvack </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president of marketing. `` Interest rates are not the primary driver of these funds; it's much more a function of the economy.'' With investment-grade bonds, declining interest rates usually lead to higher bond prices. That's because bonds keep paying the same fixed interest while rates available elsewhere are becoming less attractive. But junk-bond traders are more concerned about the financial health of the companies that issued the bonds. If the economy sours, these companies would be at risk of not earning enough to pay the interest on the bonds, or even of outright default. `` A lot of these -LRB- junk -RRB- bonds have n't been tested in a down market,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattes </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Vanguard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, another major mutual-fund operator. `` There could be a stampede out of the fund in a recession,'' he said. `` There will be a lot of people running for the door at the same time. In fact, the price may go down more because of that.'' <ORGANIZATION> Vanguard </ORGANIZATION> has seen the assets of its junk-bond fund grow 13 percent in the past two months, from about $ 1.14 billion at the end of April to about $ 1.29 billion last week. Some is from appreciation and the rest from new investors. <PERSON> Mattes </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Vanguard </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, sent brochures to its customers to warn them of the risks of its junk-bond fund. `` It should not be viewed as a short-term investment at all,'' he said. Long-term investors would be at a lesser risk of losing principal because they could ride out an economic downturn. Investors expecting declining interest rates should put their money in <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> funds, <PERSON> Litvack </PERSON> said. In fact, total return on <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds _ the total interest paid plus any change in the bond prices _ exceeded that of the higher-yielding junk bonds in the first five months of this year. The January-May return on seven-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds exceeded 6 percent, while <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION>'s junk-bond fund returned only 2.26 percent and <ORGANIZATION> Vanguard </ORGANIZATION>'s returned 2.12 percent due to major declines in the price of these bonds as the economy slowed, according to <ORGANIZATION> Lipper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Analytical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Litvack </PERSON> said junk-bond funds are not for investors saving for retirement or other needs One major mutual-fund company, <ORGANIZATION> Dreyfus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said it is so concerned about the risks of junk-bond funds that it does n't sponsor one. `` The underlying basis for junk bonds is that economic expansion will continue forever, enabling highly leveraged companies to meet their heavy debt burdens,'' said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Dreyfus </ORGANIZATION>' chairman and chief executive. Dreyfus, he said, is not that optimistic.

<HEAD>In Business, Defeated Soldiers Rise To Fight Again</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Recent events show that in modern business, unlike modern warfare, defeated soldiers often rise to fight again another day. Indicted but undaunted, junk-bond king <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> announced June 15 _ the day of his resignation from <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> _ that he was striking out on his own in a new firm. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> might have trouble getting clients since he faces $ 1.85 billion in forfeitures and a lengthy jail term if convicted on fraud and racketeering charges. But at age 42, he's willing to give it a shot. <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> is another resilient loser. After being told repeatedly that he could not have three seats on the board of a Japanese auto parts maker, the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oilman went to the company's annual meeting in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> anyway The answer remained the same _ no _ but he said he would press on. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> spent this past week trying to extricate himself from what he called an `` embarrassing situation.'' His company, <ORGANIZATION> Integrated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, had just defaulted on $ 955 million in short-term debt. By the end of the week he had patched together a refinancing plan with the help of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> that just might win grudging approval of creditors. Even those prophets of cold nuclear fusion, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Pons </PERSON>, showed it was too soon to write them off entirely. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> announced this past week it would collaborate with the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> on tabletop fusion in spite of scientists' widespread skepticism. There are other irrepressible figures out there: <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBow </PERSON>, the oft-defeated bidder for <ORGANIZATION> Prime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, the oft-defeated leader of the New Directions dissident movement of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>. What unites the diverse characters is a fine understanding of the nature of capitalism, which may be the greatest recycling machine ever invented. As long as an enterprise or an idea has any value, speculators and entrepreneurs will find a way to extract it, like a scavenger who strips the battery from an abandoned car. There is money, or a reputation, to be made. People like <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> know the odds against them are long, but that just makes the potential returns sweeter. The same goes for <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>, which undoubtedly is getting a cheaper deal with <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> than if other companies were also clamoring to get in on cold fusion. The investment might just pay off big. That's capitalism. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Darwin </PERSON> wrote in `` The Origin of Species'' that the tree of life `` fills with its dead and broken branches the crust of the earth.'' If <PERSON> Darwin </PERSON> had worked on Wall Street, he might have gone on to observe that those dead branches sometimes carry the seeds for even taller trees. In other business news this past week: _ Stock investors changed their minds about the economy Signs of an economic slowdown used to cheer investors by raising prospects for lower interest rates. But this past week fears of recession spread, especially after the government reported a larger-than-expected decline in the index of leading economic indicators for May. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 91.81 points in the week, its biggest weekly drop since 108.42 points the week of March 21-25, 1988. _ The biggest takeover fight of the moment headed into the weekend with <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> shareholders re-electing a slate of directors who oppose a $ 12.2 billion bid for <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION> The directors instead favor a $ 14 billion offer by <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which they say would create a powerful communications company. _ And finally, the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> stopped issuing dollar bills Friday in the latest step of a program to phase in the 11-sided, gold-colored `` loonie'' coin

<HEAD>Tide Turning on Wall Street?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Whether they are out in yachts or rowboats this July Fourth weekend, a lot of stock-market investors are surely wondering whether the currents have shifted on Wall Street. In the last few days leading up to midyear, the negative economic news that has been enthusiastically received for months in the financial world suddenly was n't so welcome any more. What appeared to be the turning point was the government's report Wednesday that the index of leading economic indicators, a primary statistical tool for measuring future trends, took a larger-than-expected 1.2 percent drop in May. That reinforced the prevailing view that the economy was slowing, fulfilling a primary goal of recent <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> policy. And it seemed to increase the chances that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> would move more aggressively to ease credit conditions before long. Following the standard script, interest rates fell in the bond market, reducing the competitive appeal of bonds and money-market investments in comparison to stocks. But the stock market, instead of rising, embarked on a steep decline that lasted through the end of the week. Maybe, traders seemed to be thinking, the slowdown is happening too fast. It did n't help much that several technical analysts, who concentrate on trends within the market itself rather than developments in the economy, were warning that stocks were ripe for a setback. `` The stock and bond markets and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar are about to enter into a prolonged consolidation phase that could drag through the entire third quarter,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Barthel </PERSON>, technical analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Butcher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Singer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` The end result of these expected consolidations will be to relieve the overbought and overbelieved conditions now surrounding the three markets.'' `` The market's headed for a fall,'' declared <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Feshbach </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. `` Our caution flag for the second half is at full staff.'' Investors did n't wait for the second half to act on those warnings and fears. In the last week of what had been a robust, prosperous first half for the bulls, stocks took their sharpest drop in more than a year. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 91.81 points to 2,440.06, for its largest weekly loss since it tumbled 108.42 points March 21-25, 1988. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite index dropped 4.96 to 177.90; the <ORGANIZATION> NASDAQ </ORGANIZATION> composite index for the over-the-counter market slumped 13.07 to 435.29, and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> market value index was down 5.28 at 358.97. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> averaged 162.15 million shares a day, against 168.49 million the week before. To some observers, the flareup of recession worries was actually a positive for the market's longer-term prospects. The `` soft landing'' thesis that all would go well for the economy had acquired too many believers, they said, and it was inevitable that money managers at investing institutions would begin to question what might go wrong. `` Not to worry,'' advised <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Leeb </PERSON>, editor of the advisory letter Indicator Digest. `` In postwar history we have never had a broad-based correction in stocks when -LRB- prices of -RRB- bonds were in an uptrend.'' Nevertheless, the recession-or-not debate seems likely to have climbed to a spot high on Wall Street's agenda for the immediate future. If the pattern established this past week holds, that could mean that the bond and stock markets diverge from the parallel paths they have followed for much of the 1980s. Fears of deflation prevailing over fears of inflation might fuel strong demand for high-quality interest-bearing securities like <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds, while leaving investors leery of stocks and lower-quality debt such as `` junk'' bonds.

<HEAD>Coffee Prices Percolate Amid Jitters Over Price Support Pact</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with settlement prices and other action
Friday.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDSEY TANNER</BYLINE>

 Fear that discord among the world's major coffee producers will spark a collapse of the market's 26-year-old price-support machinery kept the coffee futures market on edge this past week. Traders' caffeine jitters were tempered late in the week by hopes that members of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> will find a way to avert a crisis. On other markets, precious metals slumped but ended the week on a strong note; energy prices see-sawed in volatile trading; wheat started strong but dipped by week's end; corn and soybean prices were mostly stronger; and meat and livestock prices were mixed. The latest signal of hope in the coffee market, unconfirmed reports that the ICO may decide to postpone a vote on whether to extend the agreement with some sort of price-support mechanism in place, sent prices soaring Friday at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The current six-year price-support deal is due to expire Sept. 30, and member nations of the <ORGANIZATION> ICO </ORGANIZATION>, composed of 74 major coffee producers and consumers, are at odds over proposals for a new agreement. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> ICO </ORGANIZATION> are scheduled to vote Monday on two price-support proposals. One would extend the existing agreement as is, with no change in quotas. The other calls for extension with changes that would increase the availability of mild arabica coffees _ one of the most popular varieties. Adding to the confusion is a recommendation from the <ORGANIZATION> ICO </ORGANIZATION>'s executive board to extend the pact for two years, but to abolish its price-stabilizing quota machinery The result would leave coffee prices after Sept. 30 subject to free-market forces for the first time since 1963. The board, which met Thursday and Friday, also called for an <ORGANIZATION> ICO </ORGANIZATION> vote on immediate suspension of the quota system if it rejects the two proposals, as some analysts have predicted it will do. The executive board acts merely as an advisory group, and the full ICO is not bound by its recommendation. `` It's a very nervous market simply because it is being pushed around by these very contradictory statements,'' <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said Friday. `` Prices have been extremely erratic,'' he said. The reports that the ICO may postpone the vote for several weeks was considered bullish `` because it would imply that if they do, then the producers and the consumers will have more time to reach a compromise,'' <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON> said. But the week opened on a bearish note, with reports that <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, the world's second largest coffee producer, would move to abolish all export quotas unless the <ORGANIZATION> ICO </ORGANIZATION> can agree on one of the two proposals. That sent coffee futures prices plunging 1.63 cents to 6.05 cents Monday, with the July contract at $ 1.11 a pound _ the market's lowest close since Aug. 2, 1988 But they rebounded Wednesday on vague hopes for a solution, and again on Friday, settling .50 cent to 3.25 cents higher, with the July contract at $ 1.1137 a pound.
