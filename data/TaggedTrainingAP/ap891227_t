 <PERSON> Caesar </PERSON> glowered amid the holiday cheer. The gorilla clambered up the rocks and squatted, turning out his lower lip in displeasure as the family ate its presents and a few trees on Tuesday. <PERSON> Caesar </PERSON>'s gloom was probably caused by a cold, but if the illness was catching, his disposition was n't. The rest of the gorilla family and the family in the compound next door smelled the roses and promptly ate them. The two families of gorillas at the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Zoo were released from their quarters at midmorning to find their compounds were strewn with popcorn balls, cranberries, bougainvilleas, rawhide chews and fruit. Banana trees decorated with purple, orange and yellow roses and sprinkled with coconut snow stood outside the grottos, with boxed presents all around. Burlap stockings were placed by the rocks with care, filled with nuts and squash and all sorts of goodies. The holiday party was the work of volunteers from the Gorilla Garden, which grows supplemental foods for the zoo's dozen gorillas. `` They enjoy it because a lot of their really special favorite treats are out there,'' said <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Chatfield </PERSON>, the gorillas' keeper `` They also have some things they do n't usually get _ like a whole banana tree.''

 <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> VIII </PERSON> gave up his throne to marry <PERSON> Wallis </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> 53 years ago, but the romantic <LOCATION> Windsor </LOCATION> legend has come alive again at their mansion in the <LOCATION> Bois </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulogne </LOCATION>. In early December the wrought-iron gates of the final and favorite residence of the duke and duchess of <LOCATION> Windsor </LOCATION> were thrown open for a high tea given by <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Fayed </PERSON>, the Egyptian tycoon who paid more than $ 8 million to renovate the mansion. The owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ritz </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Harrods </ORGANIZATION> department store in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Fayed </PERSON> plans to keep the mansion open for friends and approved groups of visitors. `` Theirs was the love story of the century,'' <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Fayed </PERSON> said of the <ORGANIZATION> Windsors </ORGANIZATION>. He undertook renovation with the blessing of Mayor <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> and the City of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, which is still the official owner of the villa. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Fayed </PERSON> said he had been shocked to see the dilapidated condition of the villa when he visited after the duchess's death in 1986, with moldy walls and tags on the furniture and art objects destined for the auction block. `` It was a sight I know would have appalled the duke and duchess,'' he said, having seen the villa in its heyday at a dinner party given by the duchess, the American socialite divorcee whom the duke had married in defiance of the royal family. So <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Fayed </PERSON> took things in hand. Supervised by an Anglo-American team of decorators, the leaky roof was repaired, the interior was given a coat of paint, tapestries and woodwork were restored. Personal valuables were left in place, including framed intimate letters and photographs and silver and crystal on the dining-room table as if the <ORGANIZATION> Windsors </ORGANIZATION> were expecting guests. Countless porcelain pug dogs around the house commemorate the <ORGANIZATION> Windsors </ORGANIZATION>' family pets who always were given pride of place. `` I feel on top of the world,'' said <PERSON> Sydney </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 69, the duke's personal valet for more than 30 years, who is now occasionally in attendance dressed splendidly in gold and red livery as he was in the old days. `` I cried all through the party Mr. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Fayed </PERSON> gave three years ago to celebrate his lease on the house,'' said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a Bahamian who was hired during World II when the duke was the governor of the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. `` The restoration is so authentic I expect to see the duchess stepping down the staircase asking, ` How do I look?''' Also on hand are the <ORGANIZATION> Windsors </ORGANIZATION>' chauffeur of 20 years, <PERSON> Gregoire </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, and his wife, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said he had hidden 5,000 personal photographs in a bathroom to keep them from prying eyes during the duchess's 14-year widowhood following the duke's death in 1972. The house looks as if the <ORGANIZATION> Windsors </ORGANIZATION> just stepped out for a stroll in the Bois; books are at the bedsides, brushes and combs are in the bathrooms and some of the duchess's lingerie are tidily wrapped in tissue in her dressing room. The duke's bed has its original velvet cover with his Prince of <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> insignia and motto, `` <PERSON> Honi </PERSON> soit qui Mal y Pense,'' which translates, roughly, as `` Shame on him who thinks evil of it.'' By his bedside sprawls a touching little chimney-sweep rag doll cherished by the duke, given to him by his mother, <PERSON> Queen </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, who publicly disowned him after his indiscreet marriage. The duchess's bedroom is a symphony of `` Wallis blue'' and cream moire silk, with attractive imitation <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> XV </PERSON> and XVI furnishings and a priceless Venetian l8th century marquetry chest. Visitors also see a raft of stuffed pug dog dolls and framed needlepoint works by the duke, who loved needlepoint almost as much as golf, commemorated in souvenir golf balls all over the place. The duchess's bathroom is an artwork in itself, decorated by <PERSON> Dimitri </PERSON> <PERSON> Bouchene </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> artist who designed stage sets for <PERSON> Diaghilev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pavlova </PERSON>. Under a Napoleonic-style striped silk tent ceiling, the bathroom walls are covered with <PERSON> Bouchene </PERSON>'s floral and animal murals, with a group of his Christmas cards framed in glass lining the doors like a gallery exhibition. One of the villa's first visitors was the British-born actress <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, who asked <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Fayed </PERSON> if he planned to use the house for his own parties. `` I will indeed,'' he said, adding that he plans to keep the mansion staffed and open to small group visits by special request. In 1991, he said, he will send an exhibition of mementoes to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and other <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> cities, as well as to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and to the duchess's birthplace, <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>.

 A Jewish group acting on the strength of a favorable ruling by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> erected a 18-foot menorah outside the <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> City-County Building on Tuesday night. `` This adds some light to the darkness of winter nights and is a victory for all the people of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Elliot </PERSON> <PERSON> Katz </PERSON>, an attorney for the group Chabad.

In an involved holiday legal scramble, <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> upheld <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Barron </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCune </PERSON>'s order preventing the city from blocking Chabad's installation of the menorah <PERSON> McCune </PERSON> maintains that the courthouse steps are a public forum open to all types of expression, and <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> ruled the menorah could be allowed until a trial on the matter is held in district court. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled last summer that the menorah, a candelabrum associated with Hanukkah, was permitted outside the building because it was accompanied by secular symbols, a Christmas tree and a sign promoting liberty. <PERSON> McCune </PERSON> aided the erection of the menorah Tuesday by reducing a $ 5,000 bond that Chabad would have been required to post to cover some potential court costs incurred by the city. Chabad requested the bond be reduced to $ 1,000 but, in a compromise, <PERSON> McCune </PERSON> set the bond at $ 2,500.

 Young Chinese determined to learn English are defying police orders and gathering weekly in a local park in a dramatic display of peaceful disobedience under martial law. The mix of soft-spoken office and factory workers and full-time students, few of whom would dare challenge the government in any other way, come each Sunday to a hilltop glade in the Purple Bamboo Park famous for five years as the English Corner. There, they awkwardly accost each other and launch into careful but determined conversation in English. A well-used opening line is `` How long have you studied English?'' The park put signs up Oct. 28, declaring the corner closed. It said students were too busy with other studies. But still the English lovers keep coming. They begin arriving shortly before 10 a.m., hovering nearby until the numbers seem large enough for them to climb the now-forbidden hill. Then, huddled deep in padded coats and mufflers and stomping feet for warmth, they mingle cocktail-party style, chatting in English. Two plainclothes police burst upon the gathering one recent Sunday, grabbing elbows and trying to move the participants along. `` Hey, do n't stand around here,'' one yelled. `` Ca n't you read the signs? The corner is closed.'' The crowd of about 60 people moved sluggishly down the hill to a lakeside, where skaters glided on the frozen surface. Conversation resumed through cold-stiffened lips. `` The police never come back,'' one corner veteran said confidently. A few minutes later, one of the police gave a frustrated shout: `` Go away! Go away!'' There was a pause, then: `` What do you think of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>?'' someone asked a visitor politely. It is a practiced ritual. `` They come every week,'' according to a young man who said he was a science student. So does he, although a bit nervously. `` I learn a lot from other people. I think my English has improved,'' he said. Many of those who frequent the corner study English on their own, and it is their only opportunity to try out words they've learned from tapes or books They consider English their best hope for going abroad _ to study and perhaps, whispered one man, `` to stay for freedom.'' Certain ground rules have prevailed since June, when the army attacked pro-democracy protesters and he government began an intense campaign against dissent. `` Before we talked about anything we wanted to,'' said the science student. `` Now we talk about daily life, maybe about our -LRB- work -RRB- units, or cooking.'' `` Laundry,'' chimed in a girl in a pink parka. `` The weather,'' said a man. `` But not politics,'' concluded the student. Most believe politics is the real reason the corner was ordered closed. The student said some people used the corner before June to make speeches about democracy, believing that police _ who generally lack college educations _ would not understand. Foreign reporters also sometimes visited, using the conversations as one barometer of what young intellectuals were thinking. But almost everything in Communist-ruled <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> touches on politics, and it is hard to avoid entirely. `` What do you think about the economic crisis in socialist countries?'' the girl in pink asked. `` Crisis?'' queried a factory technician who had somehow acquired Australian-accented English. `` Do you mean ` shizi lukou'?'' he asked, using the Chinese for crossing or intersection. Someone explained, and he was quick to learn the new word. `` I heard an interesting conversation about the crisis in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' he offered. Listeners shivered with excitement at the words `` East Europe.'' `` Can we talk about international politics?'' asked a tall young man. `` Is it OK to talk about <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>?'' `` I was delighted to hear about <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>,'' whispered a man in a pale blue jacket, referring to the overthrow of hard-line Communist leader <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>. Asked what they thought of <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, the group giggled nervously. `` I have an opinion but I can not tell you,'' said one. `` He was a dictator,'' said someone bolder. `` Autocrat,'' supplied a third. `` Freedom and democracy is the trend in the world, and it makes me very happy,'' said the technician to general agreement. No one spoke of Chinese intellectuals' frustrated hopes for democratic reform in their own country. Generations of Chinese have learned to communicate dangerous ideas like that without words of any language.

 <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> reportedly killed 60,000 Romanians during his terrible reign, some sent to <LOCATION> Transylvanian </LOCATION> torture chambers so horrible that the dead leader is being compared to the monsters of myth. State media in post-Ceausescu <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> have begun to paint a horrific portrait of a man who killed with the epic blood lust of Count Dracula and the cavalier conscience of a real monster: <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>. His son, <PERSON> Nicu </PERSON>, was described as a drunk who ran down and killed two pedestrians with his car and had a special room where he used to rape women. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s execution and the new revelations about his 24-year rule has Romanians careening between revulsion and exultation. `` Oh, what wonderful news. The anti-Christ died on Christmas,'' a <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> radio announcer said after an announcement that the former Communist leader and his wife, <PERSON> Elena </PERSON>, were executed. Christmas carols then filled the air. A secret military tribunal in Monday convicted <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> and his wife of genocide, undermining the economy and attempting to flee with more than $ 1 billion stashed in foreign banks. Romanian state television Tuesday broadcast a videotape of <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> and his wife after they were executed by a firing squad, their bloody bodies slumped in front of a wall. In an official announcement, the television said the charge of genocide covered the deaths of 60,000 people. `` This is the moment of truth. We got rid of the monsters who mutilated our history. Let these tyrants be cursed. <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s soil should not accept their bodies,'' anchorman <PERSON> Viorel </PERSON> <PERSON> Popescu </PERSON> said on TV and national radio. The broadcasts were monitored in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. `` The name of <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> should never be pronounced and written again. It should be replaced with Dracula from <LOCATION> Scornicesti </LOCATION>,'' an unidentified painter in the southern <LOCATION> Transylvania </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Sibiu </LOCATION> told national radio. <LOCATION> Scornicesti </LOCATION> is the village where <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> was born Jan. 26, 1918, into a peasant's family. Even when he was alive, the iron-fisted <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> had earned the nickname of <PERSON> Vampirescu </PERSON> for his harsh rule, an allusion to Count Dracula's horror tales set in 19th century <LOCATION> Transylvania </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Bram </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoker </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and some other nations appeared critical of the decision to try, convict and execute the Ceausescus so quickly. On Monday, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> statement announcing the establishment of diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> said: `` We regret the trial did not take place in an open and public fashion.'' But <PERSON> Silviu </PERSON> <PERSON> Brucan </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Romanian </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and leading dissident who is on the 37-member revolutionary governing council, said the reason behind the <ORGANIZATION> Ceausescus </ORGANIZATION>' rapid execution was to `` crush any hopes for a lethal coup'' by his hated secret police, the Securitate. `` He was probably executed on Christmas Day to show that a new hope, the hope of freedom, was born in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> was the anti-Christ,'' an unidentified poet told the radio. During the <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> reign, dissent was ruthlessly repressed by the Securitate, a huge and sinister network of tens of thousands of people. Debt repayment and mismanaged industrialization programs triggered widespread food and energy shortages and dissidents faced prison, commitment to mental hospitals, internal exile or house arrest. Laws mandated the reporting of every unauthorized conversation with a foreigner. Every typewriter had to be registered with the police and censorship was far tighter than anywhere in the Soviet bloc. Romanian TV monitored in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> showed a former `` torture chamber'' ran by the Securitate in the western Romanian city of <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION>, where more then 12,000 protesters, including children and women, were killed by the security forces when local riots erupted Dec. 17. The revolution actually began in <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION> two days earlier, when small protests began eventually blossomed into the nationwide uprising that toppled <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> on Friday. `` It's terrifying what we see in this torture room,'' a commentator said. `` Calcinated bodies, pieces of hairy scalps, blood and tortured bodies lying on the floor. The victims were brought here naked. `` How small were <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s lackeys. They were genuine angels -LRB- by comparison -RRB-. These are nightmarish images,'' the unidentified commentator said. Tearful residents looking for missing loved ones congregated at freshly unearthed mass graves containing the bodies of hundreds of summarily executed people, some mutilated. One gruesome picture showed the body of an unborn baby whose mother had been cut open by a bayonet. The army and revolutionaries who ransacked the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> office of <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s youngest son, <PERSON> Nicu </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Sibiu </LOCATION>, southern <LOCATION> Transylvania </LOCATION>, found hundreds of Kent cigarette packs and bottles of whiskey and `` tuica,'' Romanian plum brandy. The television showed a back room where, according to the commentator, <PERSON> Nicu </PERSON>, party chief of the <LOCATION> Sibiu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> county </LOCATION>, `` used to rape women.'' Also displayed were stockings, makeup and underwear of his purported victims. <PERSON> Nicu </PERSON>, 39, was known as a womanizer, heavy drinker and a fan of Western fast cars who killed at least two people in traffic accidents, Romanian officials said. He was arrested Dec. 22. `` <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> had more dignity,'' the radio and TV commentator said. Romanian TV also showed pictures of the apartment of <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Zoia-Elena </PERSON>, where she was arrested Among the items displayed were seven expensive watches, jewelry, $ 95,000 in cash, valuable paintings taken from <LOCATION> Romanian </LOCATION> art museums and pearls `` which we do n't think are false.'' `` Such a ` modest' baggage for such a long trip -LRB- to jail -RRB-,'' the commentator said sarcastically. The TV also showed meat supposedly shipped in from <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> for her dogs. The media reported that <PERSON> Zoia </PERSON>, trained as a mathematician, asked officers before being taken away by arresting officers: `` Is there enough room for my two pets?''

 The television station that once beamed the glory of <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> to a numbed nation has become not only the voice, but the soul of the revolution that toppled his government and ended his life. While everything it broadcast once was suspect, nothing now is believed until it appears on <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Romania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>, as the station is calling itself. Although he was reported captured and executed, it was n't until television showed <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> in captivity that the nation sighed in relief. The station first broke from the propaganda of the Stalinist past on Friday morning, when <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> units joined protesters to drive <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> from his palace and from power. `` We've won. We've won,'' poet <PERSON> Murica </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinescu </PERSON> suddently shouted into the camera. But those giddy opening moments only were a prelude to the battles with <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> loyalists that followed. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> clung to the television like a mantle of power, running the country from a barricaded studio while <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s fanatical guard tried to blast it into silence. Sniper fire smashed windows and heavy shells blew holes in the walls. Early Saturday morning, news editor <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Ionescu </PERSON> announced on the air: `` We are under attack.'' He urged people to rally outside the TV station in a masive human shield to protect the building. Almost immediately, a crowd formed. People chanted, `` Freedom! Freedom!'' until gunfire broke out. Each time, they scattered and regrouped. They shouted, `` We wo n't go,'' and they did n't Outgunned, the attackers pulled back. Later that weekend, <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s guard struck again. Infiltrators stabbed people in the hallways of the 13-story complex, reportedly killing three people. For a few hours, TV screens went mysteriously blank. But the interruption was merely a technical problem, it was explained. <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> was still governed from a hectic studio littered with empty bottles, cracked coffee mugs and half-eaten sandwiches and run by people who had not slept in days. Television has played a large role in the forces of reform that swept the East bloc this year. Mass demonstrations were shown live on TV in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> in the days preceding the Communist leadership's downfall; East Germans able to watch West German broadcasts followed closely news of the loosening of travel restrictions and the rallies that brought down <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>; a Solidarity economic minister goes on the air with regular `` fireside chats'' to the people. <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Romania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> has become a chaotic reflection of the country it covers, a jumbled but jubilant mirror of the revolution it helped orchestrate. `` It is madness here, madness,'' said <PERSON> Gratiela </PERSON> <PERSON> Ripeanu </PERSON>. Her external relations job used to consist mainly of shaking hands with fraternal Bulgarians. Suddenly, she was shepherding countless foreign TV crews all desperate to relay film back home. Reporters counted on her to find them <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> members to interview. One by one, she steered people and their bulky gear through an obstacle course of gun barrels, locked gates, roiling crowds and skittish guards who looked for explosives in balpoint pen refills. Six body searches separated the street from the studio. `` We do n't know what we are doing anymore, but we're doing it,'' she said. <PERSON> Elena </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Ionescu </PERSON>, a news writer and <PERSON> Victor </PERSON>'s wife, helped out on the studio, partly because her office was a gaping hole in the eighth floor. She smiled broadly when she recognized several reporters who had sat with her until morning during the first assault. They had subsequently stayed in the relative luxury of hotel rooms, but she was still on the job. `` I've slept here, ate here, washed things out here,'' she said. `` My husband is so hoarse he can hardly talk on the air.'' Nevertheless, she seemed ready for another four days. Most of the station's 1,300 employees were caught up in the mad metamorphosis. Until the revolution, the station broadcast only two hours daily, a deadening litany of the heroic and generous qualities of <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s austerity budget left it short of equipment and supplies. Suddenly, it was on the air around the clock, and Romanians who once scorned television sat glued to their screens. Technicians cannibalized old gear and pushed technical tolerances to the limit. Armed soldiers wandered across the set, and overtired officials reverted to the hated Communist term for comrade, `` Tovarase,'' rather than `` Domnul,'' or mister, but the show went on. During the assault, section chiefs and janitors alike beamed with pride at the unflickering image they broadcast across the fearful nation. In the face of rumors and threats, the reassuring voices on television maintained the momentum of the revolt. Unlikely heroes emerged in the heat of battle. <PERSON> Marin </PERSON> <PERSON> Constantin </PERSON>, who edited youth programs, took it upon himself to make sure the eighth floor occupants made it through the night. When the shooting started, he herded eveyone into a central hallway protected from ricochets by a double layer of walls. When he found no other way to extinguish the grilled ceiling light, he deftly smashed it with a chair. When the heavy fighting began, his grin broadened, comforting others whose thoughts were beginning to rattle them. To amuse the company, he sang an old national hymn that was almost forgotten during <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s reign. It went, `` Wake up, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, from the mortal sleep into which you have been lulled by the evil tyrant.'' The song, broadcast earlier in the day over the battered transmitters, seemed to fit <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Romania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>.

 The uprising against dictator <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> gave rise to fierce resistance by his secret police, turning <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> into a land of fear, suspicion and retribution. I know, I became a victim of that chaos Saturday night. I was shot three times, narrowly escaping death. One bullet grazed my skull, and two more lodged in my left arm. Thanks to some dedicated doctors in District Hospital No. 1 in <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION>, and the friendly intervention of Yugoslav diplomats in the city, I survived and was evacuated within two days to <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s capital <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>. It is hard to describe the mood of pure panic and paranoia that pervaded <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION>, a petrochemical center in western <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> with about 350,000 inhabitants. The events that led to <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s fall and execution began a week before Christmas. Demonstrations to prevent a <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> minister from being evicted swelled into anti-government protests. Unarmed civilians were gunned down by state security troops, the dreaded Securitate, in the main square. No Westerner has been able to verify the number of fatalities, but doctors with whom I spoke said more than 4,000 died. After the slaughter, the bodies were gathered in trucks and taken to a mass grave at the city cemetery. The blood that flowed that day on the square sparked a popular thirst for revenge. Residents responded with a general strike, and the army declared itself with the people and against <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>. After state TV in <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> fell to the opposition Friday, the borders opened for the first time in four days to Western journalists. I flew to <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> late Friday, rented a car at the airport, and started driving to <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s border. Just before entering <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, I met a <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> journalist, <PERSON> Ljuba </PERSON> <PERSON> Pajic </PERSON>, who was to be my companion in the days that followed. Although I arrived at the border with no visa, the slightly drunken border guards wearing armbands in the national colors of red, blue and yellow let me in with little formality. `` American? You are with us,'' one guard whispered out of earshot of his superior. On the two-hour drive to <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION>, we were repeatedly stopped by groups of peasants waving the Romanian flag _ with the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> emblem cut out of it. `` Ceausescu kaput! <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> finito!'' they shouted to the foreigners. But once entering <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION>, tension replaced jubilation. A siren wailed and young people on the street talked fearfully of an air raid. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s forces were going to bomb the city, they claimed. So, with car lights off, fearing the bombs that never fell and avoiding the black silhouettes of tanks at many street corners, we began to look for the main hotel, where I thought we would find other journalists. <PERSON> Ljuba </PERSON> and I ended up at the Hotel <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION>, near the Opera Square. Inside the darkened lobby, we were frisked by nervous young people carrying knives, clubs and sharpened sticks. A young woman who spoke English gave me an account of the massacre: Children peacefully praying the previous Sunday, Dec. 17, were mowed down by automatic weapons, she said. When their mothers ran to them, they too were shot. It was also in the lobby, less than an hour after arriving in town, that I met my first casualty. French photographer <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Langevant </PERSON> hobbled in holding his buddy's arm, a bullet hole in his leg. He was bleeding badly, but the rat-a-tat-tat of gunfire growing nearer outside made everyone reluctant to go for help. Finally, a `` machina'' _ a car _ rolled up to the front door and Langevant was bundled inside. <PERSON> Ljuba </PERSON> and I decided to follow in our car. Headlights still off, we raced through the deserted streets, afraid to stop. We screeched into the courtyard of District Hospital No. 2. The photographer was taken to the operating room and we spent the night huddled in the doctors' lounge. The hospital, like the other buildings in <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION> at night, was kept in eerie darkness whenever possible. `` They shoot at the light,'' one physician said, drawing a curtain closed when the flicker of a television set dimly lighted the lounge. Doctors said they had been working with a constant stream of shooting victims since Dec. 17. They too were afraid, cowering on the floor when the noise of gunfire came too close. Red tracers arched over the hospital roof. It was a hairy night, but at last, by midmorning Saturday, the shooting had died down enough to go outside. Saturday we spent trying to locate an outside phone line to tell the story. In the evening, I returned to <LOCATION> Hotel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION>, where we talked to the leader of the pro-democracy forces, headquartered there. Their chief was an automotive engineer, a tall and dignified young man dressed in a black beret and trenchcoat who spoke some French. The hotel was again in total blackness and he led us through the empty restaurant to a small cafe off the kitchen, where he pushed together two tables and fed us a Romanian feast _ sliced sausages and salty cheese, washed down with grapefruit soda. A Romanian soldier with a Soviet submachine gun and several rebels looked on politely. I asked them what kind of country they wanted. Democracy and free elections was the reply. And the Ceausescus? Killing was too good for them, the group agreed. Maybe torture. After a short drive around downtown, where the fighting had been the heaviest, all appeared quiet. I made one outside phone call and left the building, Outside, the scene had suddenly changed. Gunfire erupted very close by as soon as we left. Retreating to the car, we backed away in the opposite direction. Two Italian journalists who had left the consulate with us followed in another car. What followed was a nightmare of running with nowhere to hide. Every turn in the strange city seemed to lead to another firefight. We tried to make our way back to the hotel, going in ever wider circles because of the fighting. Finally, luck ran out. Driving into an intersection, somebody flashed a light on us and shouted in Romanian. Before we could answer or get out of the car, I saw the flash of a gun and realized in an instant they were shooting at us. Immediately, I felt something slam into my arm and what felt like warm water being poured on my head. My own blood.

 For what seemed like an eternity, we screamed that we were journalists. The men who came out of a bunker to us _ some in uniform, some in civilian clothes _ screamed at us and dragged us to them. We were roughed up. One man came at me with a knife but stopped just before stabbing me. A soldier kept a gun aimed at my head. I thought they were going to kill us. My companion, <PERSON> Ljuba </PERSON>, was not hit by the gunfire, but he was beaten. They took our money. Of the Italians, one was badly wounded in the chest, and the other unhurt. Finally, to my relief, two ambulances arrived. The Italian photographer, <PERSON> Pasquale </PERSON> <PERSON> Modita </PERSON>, went first. Then me. The ride to the hospital was mercifully brief, and for my second night in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, I was once again under the physicians' protection. The bullets had gone into my upper left arm, a few inches from my heart. The other one cut a gash in my scalp, but did not penetrate my skull. `` You were very, very lucky,'' my favorite doctor told me. Time and again, the doctor said after my first operation to explore the wound in my arm, `` Someone as lucky as you will live a long time.'' For the two nights and a day that I convalesced in the hospital, battle raged outside my window between the Romanian army and small, ruthless commando units loyal to <PERSON> Ceasescu </PERSON>. I worried that the Securitate would win and murder us all. But Christmas Day, about 36 hours after being shot, ambulances arranged by the <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> government and The <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> took me and <PERSON> Zzeljko </PERSON> <PERSON> Ssajan </PERSON>, a wounded reporter from <LOCATION> Zagreb </LOCATION> television, to <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>. I was never so happy to cross a border.

 Flooding in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s normally dry east-central region has killed 24 people and left at least 140,000 homeless, national civil defense spokesman <PERSON> Silvio </PERSON> <PERSON> Reiner </PERSON> says. Speaking by telephone on Tuesday from <LOCATION> Brasilia </LOCATION>, the capital, 750 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reiner </PERSON> said 140 cities and towns in five of the 26 states were affected by flooding, caused by more than two weeks of torrential rain. Unofficial reports said most of those killed drowned or were buried when houses collapsed. <PERSON> Reiner </PERSON> said the worst hit area was northeastern <LOCATION> Bahia </LOCATION> state, where 105,000 people were driven from their homes. Road traffic between <LOCATION> Cachoeira </LOCATION>, 930 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>, and the rest of the country was cut off by the <LOCATION> Paraguacu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, which overflowed and covered much of the city. TV film showed canoes and rowboats paddling down flooded streets with families carrying sofas, stoves and other household goods to dry ground. The city dates from the <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> colonial era and is considered a national historic monument. <PERSON> Cachoeira </PERSON> was without electricity and was running out of food and drinking water, <PERSON> Reiner </PERSON> said. Civil defense workers were flying in emergency shipments of food, blankets and medicine, mainly antityphoid and snakebite serum, he said. In <ORGANIZATION> Minas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gerais </ORGANIZATION> state, south of <LOCATION> Bahia </LOCATION>, 5,765 houses collapsed in 70 townships, the official said, and 24,200 people were homeless. About 11,000 Brazilians had to abandon their homes in nearby <LOCATION> Goias </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tocantins </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maranhao </LOCATION> states, he said. More rain for the region was forecast.

 Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is gone, but the question of fashioning a security force to replace his bully boys is causing friction between the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military and the new Panamanian civilian government. Sources on both sides agree there's a problem. The civilians want a weakened army that would be little more than a police force and would not represent a threat to the government. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is pressing for a professional army to provide security for the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. Panamanian civilians have been intimidated by the military for more than 20 years, suffering exile, torture, imprisonment and death. The Panamanian military has not had much respect for politicians, whom they considered weak and beholden to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` The truth is that both, the civilian and the military must be re-educated,'' a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military source told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are telling the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> military that they must understand their role in society under civilian power. And we are telling the civilians that a strong military organization is needed too,'' the source said, on condition of anonymity. The <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> is due to be turned over to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> on Dec. 31, 1999, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases are to be closed unless a further agreement is reached with the Panamanian government. Since the treaties give the two countries joint responsibiilty for canal security even after 2000, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sources say at least two bases probably will be maintained, rather than the 10 major installations that now support 12,000 troops. Ironically, the Panamanian army under <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON> was the core of the long drive to eliminate the sovereign <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> enclave in the Canal Zone and negotiate the 1977 treaties. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials insist the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will honor the treaties. The dispute over how to reconstitute the Panamanian forces is taking place even as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officers work with Panamanian officers to do exactly that, despite civilian unease. `` It is a matter of concern that the members of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> are being reintegrated, and not by the Panamanian government, but by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Materno </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON>, a lawyer who helped negotiate the 1977 canal treaties but left the government in a dispute with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Vice president and minister of government <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> has spoken of a <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, avoiding all reference to the old name of <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> or previous names, such as National Guard. `` You can call it what you will,'' a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> source said. `` It has to be a professional force, army, national guard or whatever.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military leaders here, who worked with the Panamanians for years and know them well, feel some _ especially those jailed by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> following coup attempts _ can be trusted enough to form the core of an army. Before the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attack that toppled <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> Dec. 20, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military sources told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces could `` work with some of the Panamanian top officers, even if they are not shining examples of democracy.'' According to a <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> military source, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officers were rather blunt when they told President <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> what they want in a Panamanian army. <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> was elected president May 7, but <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> nullified the vote and <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> was not installed until after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assault. `` The politicians did not shed any blood,'' another source said. `` The blood was shed by the Americans and the few <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> units that fought.'' Both the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Panamanian military, even those opposed to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, feel the opposition was unwilling to take risks to try to topple <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Comparisons with uprisings in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and, lately, <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> were raised frequently. `` They want us to do the job for them,'' a top-ranking <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officer told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces did exactly that. Some of the new leaders of the future Panamanian military are the majors and captains who were arrested March 16, 1988, after their failed coup against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. They include men like Maj. <PERSON> Santiago </PERSON> <PERSON> Fundora </PERSON> and Maj. <PERSON> Aristides </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdonedo </PERSON>, who have been named directors of logistics and public security respectively, and Maj. <PERSON> August </PERSON> <PERSON> Villalaz </PERSON>, who will be in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. They have been working closely with the commander of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION>, Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON>, and other <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> officers at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clayton </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` The person who is really governing in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> now is <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON> said he saw a former lieutenant colonel surrender with other officers and return home with a `` passport from <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON>, not even from <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> authorities.'' `` We're concerned about too many of those guys coming back in,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> politician involved in forming the new government. The <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> government would like to set up `` something like what <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> has.'' <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, just north of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, has been spared coups and military rule in large measure because the armed forces were dissolved more than 40 years ago. <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> has only a civilian police force and relies on the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> charter, which calls for collective defense in case of attack. In essence that means relying on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials are not sympathetic to the civilian government's desires. `` <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> may feel that he was elected in May,'' one source said `` but his majority meant nothing and he is where he is because of the American guns.''

 Columnist <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchwald </PERSON> came up with an original idea when he proposed a movie based on the comic adventures of an African king in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, says the co-creator of the old TV series `` <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Buchwald </PERSON> is suing <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 5 million, alleging the 1988 <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> hit `` Coming to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' was based on an idea he optioned to the studio in 1983. Paramount's attorney, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Draper </PERSON>, has contended that <PERSON> Buchwald </PERSON> failed to live up to his contract with <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> because his idea was not original _ that it was based on a <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON> movie called `` A King in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>Singh Government Halts Future Contracts With Swedish Firm Bofors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The new government of Prime Minister V.P. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> says it will temporarily stop buying weapons from a Swedish armaments firm accused of paying huge bribes to secure a 1986 contract with the Indian army. The alleged impropriety in <ORGANIZATION> AB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION>' $ 1.4 billion Howitzer gun deal was a key campaign issue for <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, whose centrist coalition ousted <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> from power in last month's elections. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, who is also the country's defense minister, announced in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday that <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION> will be barred from future contracts until `` they satisfy us in their conduct in regard to -LRB- the -RRB- Howitzer guns.'' At least two newspaper investigations have sought to prove that <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION> paid as much as $ 50 million in bribes and commissions to yet unnamed persons. The allegations have not been proved since they surfaced in April 1987, but one newspaper, The Hindu, has published purported documents that it said established <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s links with recipients of the alleged bribes and commissions. The Hindu, and another newspaper, Indian Express, said senior officials in <LOCATION> Gandhi </LOCATION>'s cabinet and persons close to him received the bribes. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> has also been accused of covering up the investigation by handing it over to pliant officers. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> has denied the charges and maintained that his actions have been above board. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> government </ORGANIZATION> said in its election manifesto that it will unearth and disclose the names of the commission recipients within 15 days of taking office. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> was sworn in Dec. 2. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> denied that he is not longer keen on probing the <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION> deal now that his coalition is power. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> said the government order Tuesday covers `` supply of names of recipients and return of money paid in regard to <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION> gun transactions.'' `` This shows there is no lack of enthusiasm. We are determined. There is no question of compromise on anything. `` We will do everything to get the names and come to the truth,'' <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> said. His colleagues in Parliament loudly thumped desks. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> was interrupted by <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members when he continued with the statement. <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Shankar </PERSON> <PERSON> Dayal </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharma </PERSON> adjourned the session amid the uproar triggered by angry shouts from <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s colleagues. Hours after <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s truncated statement, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said it had been directed by the prime minister to stop all future contracts with <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION>. It was the new government's first major policy decision on the <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION> deal since taking office. `` The embargo will be till such time as the company satisfied the government of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> about their previous conduct,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. The current Howitzer gun deal apparently remained unaffected by the decision as neither <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> nor the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> referred to it.

 Anti-aircraft batteries opened fire late Tuesday at two unidentified aircraft that flew low over the capital, the government radio station <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nicaragua </ORGANIZATION> reported.

<HEAD>SEC Creates New Fraud Unit to Protect Small Investors</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, catapulted into the headlines by its pursuit of multimillion-dollar insider trading scandals, is putting out the word that it intends to be just as aggressive in protecting small investors. <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> is creating a new fraud unit at the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> designed to police the sale of securities by savings and loan institutions. Investigators have charged that some small investors lost their life savings when they bought securities sold by <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L branches in the mistaken belief that their investments were protected by federal deposit insurance. `` We intend to see to it that when people are sold securities, they are provided all the necessary information,'' <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> also announced Tuesday that he had selected <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> McLucas </PERSON>, a 12-year <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> veteran, to be the new director of enforcement at the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>. He will succeed <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>, who resigned in July after supervising such landmark insider trading cases as the investigation of <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> and the Wall Street firm of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Both <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> and <PERSON> McLucas </PERSON> stressed that insider trading still would be a top <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> priority, but they also indicated that the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>, with a 20 percent increase in its budget, would devote more resources to more low-profile crooks. `` Where there is an abuse of a customer's trust, those are the kinds of cases where we are going to make sure we have an impact,'' <PERSON> McLucas </PERSON> said at a news conference where his selection was announced. Individual investors have been leaving the market in droves in recent years, scared off in part by extreme trading volatility. Many officials believe the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> must return to its primary mission of bolstering confidence in financial markets through protection of the small investor. <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON>, who was picked for the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> post by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> last summer, said both the administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had expressed a strong desire to crack down on abuses against individual investors. <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> noted that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approved a 20 percent increase in the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> budget this year, enough to allow the agency to hire 100 more attorneys. Part of the increased staffing will be used, <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> said, to create a special 25-attorney unit to investigate overly aggressive sales of securities by savings and loans and other financial institutions. Such sales became a major focus of congressional hearings into the activities at <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Calif.-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L whose failure is expected to end up costing taxpayers a record $ 2 billion. Small investors told congressional investigators they were lured into purchasing bonds in <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION>' parent company, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, in the mistaken belief that their money was protected by federal deposit insurance. When <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, which is headed by <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, filed for protection under the bankruptcy law, it left some 22,000 small investors who had purchased nearly $ 200 million in corporate bonds in the lurch. <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> said the new <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> unit will try to prevent financially ailing <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls from turning to fraudulent practices in a desperate effort to raise cash. <PERSON> McLucas </PERSON>, 39, joined the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> in 1977, two years after receiving a law degree from <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>, who resigned to join a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> law firm, served for four years as <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> enforcement chief, taking over from <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fedders </PERSON>, who was forced to resign after allegations surfaced that he had beaten his wife. <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> was credited with restoring morale at the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> and directing some of the agency's biggest investigations, beginning with the exposure of <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> in May 1986. <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>'s cooperation led to a $ 100 million settlement with speculator <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> in turn implicated <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION>, which led to a $ 650 million settlement with the securities firm, the largest securities fraud case ever brought by the government.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidents since <PERSON> Teddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> in 1903 have talked about the need to install democracy in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Some sent troops under the banner of shoring up democratic rule. But all have been stymied by the lack of democratic tradition in the strategically placed isthmus and by their overriding desire to protect <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rights of passage through the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>, scholars say. When President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> went on television Wednesday morning to explain why he dispatched troops to remove Panamanian strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> from power, he cited the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people's desire for democracy and peace `` The people of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> seek only to support them in pursuit of these noble goals,'' he said. `` The rhetoric about favoring democracy is no more than that. It's a pretense,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Peeler </PERSON>, who heads the Center for the Study of the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Bucknell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. The real <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> desire is `` for democratic government, read reliable government, one that wo n't threaten our control of the canal,'' <PERSON> Peeler </PERSON> added. The few times in their 86-year history of independence when Panamanians have supported a truly democratic government, `` We were n't willing to accept their choice,'' <PERSON> Peeler </PERSON> said. That includes <PERSON> Arnulfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>, a populist leader elected president twice in the 1940s and again in 1968. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>' left-leaning views did not sit well with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which was not sorry to see him ousted after several days in office by <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> commander Gen. <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON> proved an even bigger problem for the administration, with his pro-Cuban policies and strong nationalism which opposed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> right under the 1903 treaty to use the canal `` in perpetuity.'' Increasing friction with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> led to the ratification of a new treaty in 1978 ceding the canal to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in the year 2000 but reserving the right to intervene if shipping through the waterway were threatened. Threats to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> use of the canal were what prompted the first dispatch of military force to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. When <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, which ruled <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in the 19th Century, refused to approve the 1903 canal treaty with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> sent warships to help the growing Panamanian secessionist movement. But the warships only stood by as the secessionists launched a bloodless revolt and declared independence. In August 1914, the same month World War I broke out, the first ships passed through the canal. But political chaos reigned and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> sent troops to register voters and supervise elections. Each time that happened _ in 1908, 1912 and 1916 _ the losing side blamed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interference. By the 1930s, `` there was growing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> frustration with the attempts to instill democracy in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerome </PERSON>, a professor of history at <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Madison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gerome </PERSON> has written extensively about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to organize the 1912 elections. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s strategic importance grew immensely in World War II, when the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military presence rose sharply to defend oil shipments from <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> against German interception. The hitherto limited <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military presence, which had been centered mostly around the canal, spread to other parts of the country. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in the 1950s and 1960s was ruled by a succession of families from among a thin elite. While not a military state, neither was it truly democratic. <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON>' rise to power in 1968 transferred power to the military, with a nominal role for civilian governments. Such was the setup under <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, too, after <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON> died in a 1981 plane crash. `` Various American presidents hoped the roots of democracy might grow,'' said <PERSON> Gerome </PERSON>. `` What they failed to understand is that you ca n't export democracy.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, abhorrent though he is now to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration which nurtured him in the 1970s, enjoyed strong popular appeal among <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s poor. <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, who was installed at a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military facility as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s president on Thursday based on the results of last May's elections, does not enjoy <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s popular appeal. His main support comes from middle-class merchants. `` Support for him is weak, not passionate,'' and being propped up by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can only be a liability, said <PERSON> Peeler </PERSON>, adding, `` People are n't celebrating democracy, they're looting. Does n't <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> see that?''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Quail Hunting a Tradition for President Busyh</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is winding up his first year as president pretty much the same way he ended the year before, and the year before that, going back several decades: quail hunting on a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> ranch. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides say they hope he'll have better luck than last year, when dry conditions made the tiny game birds scarce. The president will spend several days isolated _ but never out of touch, aides insist _ at the 10,000-acre Lazy F Ranch near <LOCATION> Beeville </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, owned by his friend, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> millionaire <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Farish </PERSON>. `` It's been a tradition for the past 20 years,'' said aide <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, who worked for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as vice president and has been along on several of the previous quail-hunting trips. `` They drive around the ranch in big specially designed trucks, then hunt with dogs. If they can catch turkey, too, then that's a big treat,'' <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said. In the past, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has hunted quail with a 20-gauge shotgun, dressed in snake-resistant chaps, heavy leather boots and an orange hunting cap. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, expected to be along on the trip, is known to prefer turkey hunting, which requires greater patience. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who likes to jump from event to event, has defended the sport of quail hunting as more to his liking _ and has asserted that the birds are not to be regarded as cute animals but as wily, determined quarry. `` These are n't animals _ these are wild quail, `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared during last year's trip in a remark that angered animal rights groups. `` You've got to eat. Our forefathers ate by harvesting game.'' The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> office of The Fund for Animals has written to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asking him to cancel the hunt, and plans to have animal activists travel to <LOCATION> Beeville </LOCATION> to protest his activities if he carries out his hunting plans. It seems likely that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> will discuss another wily, determined quarry while on the ranch _ deposed <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> dictator <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s decision to go Sunday to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> embassy in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, where he is currently in hiding, took a lot pressure off the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration as it seeks to help restore post-invasion order in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. However, aides said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> never wavered from his determination to make the hunting trip, and that little _ short of a major crisis _ would force him to cancel the trip. The town of <LOCATION> Beeville </LOCATION>, population about 15,000, is throwing a barbecue for the president tonight upon his arrival _ but probably wo n't see him again. Once he enters the vast ranch, he is not expected to be seen publicly in the area. He will fly by helicopter directly to <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> on Friday. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> of neighboring <LOCATION> Goliad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, is fussing to the White House that the part of the ranch where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> hunts is actually in <LOCATION> Goliad </LOCATION>, not <LOCATION> Beeville </LOCATION> _ and that it should be able to share in the publicity. But the sheriff of <LOCATION> Goliad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <PERSON> J.K. </PERSON> <PERSON> McMahan </PERSON>, says it's fine with him if the president keeps a low profile. Referring to recent stories that Colombian drug lords may have put a $ 30 million price on the president's head, <PERSON> McMahan </PERSON> said recently: `` I do n't want him killed, period, but I damn sure do n't want him killed in my county.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also plans to bracket his quail-hunting with two fishing expeditions _ another endeavor in which the president has not had much recent luck. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> planned to fish for redfish in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, off <PERSON> Corpus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christi </PERSON>, today on his way to <LOCATION> Beeville </LOCATION>. And on New Year's Day, after spending several days in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, including a side trip on Sunday to two military hospitals in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> to visit soldiers wounded in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will take about five hours out on his return to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to fish for bass on a private lake near <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Modest Consumer Food Price Rise Expected in 1990</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Consumer food prices are still on track to increase by a modest 3 percent to 5 percent in 1990 despite the bitter cold that has ravaged citrus and winter vegetable crops, says an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> analyst. The food price forecast was made last month, and economist <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Parlett </PERSON> said Tuesday he is sticking by it, at least for now. Overall food prices are up an average of about 5.7 percent this year, the largest annual gain since a 7.8 percent jump in 1981. Much of this year's increase was due to lingering effects of the 1988 drought and poor weather early in 1989. `` I'm not worried about my overall forecast -LRB- for 1990 -RRB- at this point,'' <PERSON> Parlett </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` But there'll be some impact, and possibly higher prices in the first quarter.'' <PERSON> Parlett </PERSON> said he and other agency analysts are `` still trying to assess the damage'' to citrus and vegetable crops in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and elsewhere. `` The main thing is oranges,'' he said. `` Vegetables _ tomatoes, bell peppers, celery _ they're some of the big volume things that would be coming out of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> now.'' <PERSON> Parlett </PERSON> said 90 percent of the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> oranges are for processing and that a lot of them can be salvaged for juice. The main source of `` fresh market'' oranges is <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` There will be some -LRB- retail -RRB- price impact,'' he said. `` But since we do have decent supplies in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> this year ... the supply impact will be minimal.'' With the supply of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> orange juice reduced by the freezing weather, <PERSON> Parlett </PERSON> said imports from <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> will probably rise sharply. `` We've got super supplies in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> this year, but the price has been fairly low because of the higher supplies,'' he said. `` But now that we probably will be importing, that will push the price up some.'' <PERSON> Parlett </PERSON> said he had not seen damage reports from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where state officials have estimated losses of 70 percent of the citrus and 80 percent of the winter vegetables. Vegetable losses are `` a more temporary kind of thing'' because those crops can be replanted, he said. Growers were just starting to harvest <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s main supply of winter vegetables when the cold weather struck. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> is still producing vegetables, however, and `` this time of year we start getting produce out of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, too,'' <PERSON> Parlett </PERSON> said. `` There's no doubt that some of the supplies will be cut short, and we'll probably see higher prices'' at produce counters, he said. In his forecast last month, <PERSON> Parlett </PERSON> said 1990 average retail prices of all fruits and vegetables might rise only 1 percent to 3 percent, compared with the preliminary 7.8 percent gain registered this year and 7.6 percent in 1988. <PERSON> Parlett </PERSON> said the current freeze damage `` might push us to the high end'' of the 1990 forecast range _ 1 percent to 3 percent _ and, if conditions worsen, could push it even higher. `` Oranges themselves are n't going to do much to hurt that range, and the vegetables will recover later on,'' he said. According to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> computations based on <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> price information, prices of fresh fruits and vegetables last year accounted for 11.4 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> BLS </ORGANIZATION> consumer price index for food bought in grocery stores, while processed fruits and vegetables made up only 6.8 percent of the index. Meats, by comparison, accounted for 20.3 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> BLS </ORGANIZATION> food-at-home price index, while cereals and bakery products accounted for 14 percent; and dairy products, 12.3 percent.

<HEAD>Bush Domestic Policy Adviser Takes `Honest Broker' Approach</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 He is President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s top adviser on domestic issues _ from gun control to clean air _ a veteran of three presidencies who knows government inside out and is such a workaholic he sometimes sleeps in his White House office. From <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>'s arrival at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on the same day <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> left office in scandal, through every Republican administration since, he has had a hand in crafting policies that affect millions of Americans. Today as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s domestic policy adviser, he is the presidential assistant who reigns over issues such as child care, the drug war, education and auto pollution. But <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>'s is a name little known to most Americans. `` He does n't like to hog attention,'' says <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> legal counsel <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyden </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, adding, `` Do n't mistake that for lack of influence or lack of force.'' The president typically consults with <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> on a daily basis for what some describe as <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>'s `` honest broker'' approach to sifting through competing policy options. He is <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s intermediary to interest groups, members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and government agencies that want to sell their side of a given issue. He also gives speeches on administration policy, with a methodical style recalling his days as a Rhodes scholar and professor of government and politics at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>. But his low-key image belies a tough-minded dealer who is fiercely protective of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s interests, associates say. `` I found <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> to be cautious. He likes you to verify everything,'' said <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Fraternal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Order </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, who sought <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s support for a waiting period and background check for gun purchasers. That idea was rejected. And under <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>'s guidance, other ideas for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s much-proclaimed `` kinder, gentler'' <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> have been muted along the way. As the administration point man at the education summit with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the nation's governors, <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> ensured joint endorsement of results-oriented education without committing <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to specific spending. While he led the administration's drive for a new clean air package that went well beyond President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s stringency, it did n't quite measure up to the aspirations of environmental groups. Perhaps because he tries to give <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a balanced view of all viable policy options, <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> is seen by some as a weaker adviser than might be expected of his position. One White House colleague said <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>'s effectiveness is dampened by White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>'s unquestioned dominance, making it impossible for <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> to assume a larger role. Asked if that is true, <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> says he is `` quite happy to be part of a collegial effort.'' `` I do n't go out and do things that I'm not going to discuss with him, but he gives me a lot of latitude,'' he said, referring to <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>. <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>, who often spends the night in his White House office, admits to being a workaholic and `` a bit of a perfectionist.'' `` I have never regretted the extra effort. ... I know I'm not going to be doing this for the rest of my life,'' he said. `` I view it as a rare opportunity.'' His introduction to the White House came Aug. 9, 1974. Arriving from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> to start work as a White House fellow, <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> recalls, he ran into his new boss, then-Vice President <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, at the elevator. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> greeted him somewhat distractedly and headed off to his historic final Oval Office meeting with <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> recalled. Later that day, a <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> aide assigned <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> to be the secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s transition team. He helped write a report based on interviews with all the Cabinet members and senior players in government. Under <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> had a variety of jobs including special assistant to the president and executive secretary to the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. During the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration he also held several <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> jobs, including director of the Office of Policy Development. Porter me <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> over tennis, a game for which both share a passion and considerable skill. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> had just named <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to be his <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director and invited both men to play on the White House courts. <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> says he can tell a lot about a person from his tennis game. About <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, he said: `` One thing I look for is how they call the lines ... In all the time I've played with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> over a 15-year period, I have never once had occasion to question his line calls. He is scrupulously honest.'' Other <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> tennis traits, <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> said, are patience, persistence and strategy, reflecting a methodical approach in how he approaches other things as well.

<HEAD>Stealth Fighter Passes its First Combat Test</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Pentagon says the Stealth fighter passed its first combat test during the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> military intervention by hitting its targets in a raid on a field outside a Panamanian military barracks. `` The mission was successful,'' spokesman <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said Tuesday, telling reporters that the F-117 aircraft's sophisticated bombs `` precisely hit their targets.'' Asked whether the F-117's had any other role in the intervention, the spokesman said, `` No, that was the sole mission. Others were considered but they were discarded.'' He declined to say what they were. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> also declined to say how many of the airplanes were involved or what kind of bombs they dropped. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday quoted unnamed government officials as saying they understood the plane was tapped for the job of bombing hideouts of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> before he could get away. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> repeated earlier <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> statements that the objective of the Stealth plane was `` not to hit the barracks, but rather, in fact, the mission was to miss the barracks and hit the field _ and by nature of the explosion, disorient and stun and confuse and frighten, frankly,'' the Panamanian soldiers. `` I'm told that the F-117 hit it very precisely and that it was the precision of the F-117's bombing capability that was the reason it was used,'' he said. `` I do n't know how much of a factor the stealthiness was,'' he said.

 When they first dated in 1982, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Elson </PERSON> opened doors for his future wife, <PERSON> Robin </PERSON>, cooked romantic dinners and lit her cigarettes. `` I figured my knight in shining armor had finally come,'' said <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Elson </PERSON>, who has an 11th-grade education and was selling Avon products when she met the 188-pound, 5-foot-8 auto mechanic. What he did n't tell her was that he had been married four times, that one previous wife was hiding from him and another got a restraining order against him when he beat her for slicing onions too big. They married after a two-month courtship. He showed up 45 minutes late and drunk for the wedding. Six months later, when <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> objected to <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> going on a Saturday fishing trip, he asked his friend to wait outside, went in the house and blackened both her eyes. It was the opening of a brutal reign that left the two children he and <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> had together, sons <PERSON> Camrin </PERSON>, 4, and <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> 2, and a daughter from <PERSON> Robin </PERSON>'s previous marriage, <PERSON> Renee </PERSON>, 11, living in terror. <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> and the children were not only beaten, but <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> also left her lists of chores to be completed, limited her nail polish colors to pale pink and peach, forbade her to wear makeup, told her what food to buy and checked her change against grocery receipts. Last December, <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> picked up a rifle as her husband lay in his recliner chair after a morning of drinking and beating his family and their pet dog. The 4-foot-9, 70-pound woman braced herself against a wall and fired three times, killing him. A jury in <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> last month acquitted the 28-year-old woman of murder after hearing a wide range of testimony about a married life filled with terror and abuse. He beat her because the pork chops she cooked were too dry. He slugged her in the stomach while she was pregnant because she burned the toast, then apologized with flowers. Neighbors said they watched _ horrified but too terrified of <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> to call police _ as he ordered one pleading child to do 100 push-ups on hot cement and shoved a running garden hose down the throat of another. `` If he told me I was stupid, I believed it. If he told me he would kill me, I believed it. If he opened the door and said ` Go,' I would n't, for fear he'd stab me in the back on my way out,'' <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> said in an interview published in Tuesday's <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. `` I was a robot.'' Prosecutors were appalled by the jury's vote, but defense attorneys hailed the decision, saying jurors are ready to accept the battered wife defense. `` Is this a signal that men who get frustrated by the actions of their wives can kill them? That whenever we get frustrated with someone we are entitled to exact the ultimate sentence _ death?'' asked <PERSON> Denis </PERSON> <PERSON> Petty </PERSON>, deputy district attorney. The law requires an `` imminent danger'' to justify a killing in self-defense. Prosecutors insist that was not the case when <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> shot and killed her husband. `` She could have left the state, gone to a neighbor, called the police. He was asleep when the first shot was fired. He was n't posing any threat And when we start allowing citizens to take matters into their own hands, we are back to the law of the jungle,'' <PERSON> Petty </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> tried twice to escape, and both times <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> found her. After the second time he found her, he promised to reform. But when they returned home, he took away her check-cashing card and house key, quit his job, and never left the house without one of the children. He often took the telephone with him. `` It's like the scientific experiment where they shocked dogs to the point that even when the gate was left open, the dogs never left,'' defense attorney <PERSON> Lynda </PERSON> <PERSON> Vitale </PERSON> said. `` The dogs saw the open gate not as a means of escape, but an invitation to more punishment.'' Neighbors said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> and his little sister were raised in the house that he later inherited from his two alcoholic parents. While they were growing up, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> and his sister were often thrown against the wall by their parents, or left alone at night while they went out for a night of drinking. When <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> got big enough, he began beating his mother. Sounds of violence from the house were common. The sounds continued after <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> moved in. Neighbors reported hearing the children shouting, `` Please, Daddy, do n't.'' `` I knew what he was like. I tried not to irritate him. I was scared to death of that man,'' said longtime neighbor <PERSON> Nola </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Martino </PERSON>, 74. <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> and her family now live in a two-bedroom apartment in <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. She has put on 25 pounds and is trying to stop smoking. The entire family is undergoing extensive therapy, the Times said. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Martino </PERSON> can see the <PERSON> Elson </PERSON> house from her kitchen window. `` I cry about it and I pray about it,'' she said. `` I even prayed for <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> that he would n't go to hell. But I do n't know how he could n't.''

<HEAD>Bush Signs Order Implementing Pay Hikes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Top government salaries will rise by up to 35 percent in the next 13 months, under an executive order signed by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that carries out the recently enacted pay raise and ethics bill. Also under the plan, all federal workers will receive a 3.6 percent cost-of-living pay increase. The order, signed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Tuesday at the presidential retreat at Camp David, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, follows his signature earlier this month on the pay raise and ethics bill. The measure will raise top government salaries by up to 35 percent over the next 13 months, with <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> salaries jumping from the current $ 89,500 to $ 96,600 in 1990 and more than $ 120,000 in 1991, plus a cost-of-living adjustment. But by then the 435 members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> will be barred from accepting honoraria, generally fees for making speeches. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> salaries would climb in 1990 from $ 89,500 to $ 98,400. But senators balked at giving up their honoraria. The new law would not bar speaking fees for senators, but they also would not get the big jump in salaries in 1991 that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> gets. Senators could keep $ 26,900 in honoraria compared to $ 35,800 presently. Federal judges and top executive branch officials also would get an immediate 4.1 percent raise and 3.6 percent, compounded on that, on Jan. 1, 1990, as a catch-up for two years without a cost-of-living adjustment. House employees and other top federal executive and judicial officials also would be barred from accepting speech fees beginning in 1991. Currently, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members are limited to earning speech fees equivalent to 30 percent of their salary. Senators can make up to 40 percent, but that will fall with their pay increase to slightly more than 27 percent. Under the pay package, top-level members of the executive service level, who now earn a maximum of $ 99,500, would earn up to $ 107,300 under the legislation and the executive order signed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Penny </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollis </PERSON> left <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> last summer and bought a home in this farm belt town so fast that she did n't notice the major landmark: a grain elevator `` I thought, ` Elevator, what's so special about an elevator? Is n't that what goes up and down in department stores?''' she recalled. Hoping to save its businesses and its school, <PERSON> Rolfe </PERSON> put out a national invitation two years ago, offering a free lot and $ 1,200 cash to anyone who builds a house worth $ 30,000. About 70 people have accepted the invitation, increasing the population by almost 10 percent. Their 20 children padded school enrollment to 190. Four houses have been built, although none by the transplants, who are happy to rent or buy existing homes at a fraction of the price they're used to paying. `` We paid $ 4,500 for it, plus $ 1,500 for the garage,'' says <PERSON> Becky </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> of her century-old, 3,000-square-foot house. `` In <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, it would probably go for $ 300,000.'' To Mrs. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>, who moved from the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> city this year for their retirement, this town about 80 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION> is just what she and her husband were looking for. `` We were thinking about retiring and moving to a small community and one morning on the boob tube, here comes the story about <PERSON> Rolfe </PERSON>,'' she said. They visited, liked the place and decided to settle. `` It's real slow here,'' she said. `` People are genuinely friendly. If they call on you or visit, it's because they want to. ... You do n't have to be suspicious of people at your door. `` You go downtown and find cars parked at the curb, running, with babies in them. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, you would never leave it unlocked, let along running with a kid in it. That would be like stamping the kid on the forehead with, ` Take me, I'm available.''' For that matter, a car has n't been stolen in <LOCATION> Rolfe </LOCATION> in three years, said City Administrator <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Jochims </PERSON>. <PERSON> Alcides </PERSON> and <PERSON> Guelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendoza </PERSON>, who came from <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> by way of the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, tired of the rush and risk of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The move was especially good for their four children, three in school and an 8-month-old, says Mrs. <PERSON> Mendoza </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, they lived in a very good area, `` but four or five blocks over, there were buildings where there was trouble.'' `` I like it here because I do n't have too much problem for my kids,'' she said. `` Here many people look after kids. Everybody takes care of everybody. People here make me feel welcome.'' Until her husband found a job in nearby <LOCATION> Pocahantas </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Mendoza </PERSON> received public assistance for the infant. `` But now my husband found a good job and when I pick up my last check this month, I tell how much we appreciate but we do not need any more,'' she said. Other families are n't so quick to get on their feet. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Walrod </PERSON>, director of social services for <LOCATION> Pocahontas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, said he knows of about a dozen people receiving public assistance in <LOCATION> Rolfe </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Jochims </PERSON> said most of the newcomers are on their own. `` I know there are families who need assistance, like a lot of Iowans. Whether we like it or not, these people are not disposable,'' he said. `` This is a free society. We're concerned about the people who come here.'' The elevator is the main employer in <LOCATION> Rolfe </LOCATION>, but there are ample opportunities for skilled workers in nearby communities, <PERSON> Jochims </PERSON> said. The county unemployment rate is 1.1 percent. `` So far, the businesses have been happy with the workers they've received and I feel good about it. People are moving to <PERSON> Rolfe </PERSON> to better themselves,'' <PERSON> Jochims </PERSON> said. After her husband died of a brain tumor two years ago, Ms. <PERSON> Hollis </PERSON>, 31, decided she and her four children, ages 3 to 14, needed to get away from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. `` I saw this article in a woman's magazine and decided to drive out,'' she said. `` I could n't get over the openness. I kept stopping the car and getting out so I could see how far I could see. `` I really did n't check out <PERSON> Rolfe </PERSON> very much, it was the land I loved. I put a down payment down on this house right away.'' She said relatives practically dared her to leave, betting that she would n't, and said she's having reservations. `` I used to socialize all the time and now I do n't know anybody,'' she said.

 The dollar remained weak against the yen Wednesday, while share prices on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> moved to a new high. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained 257.69 points Tuesday, added another 120.32 points, or 0.31 percent, to close at 38,801.63. The dollar closed at 142.10 yen, down 0.27 yen from Tuesday's close of 142.37 yen After opening at 142.13 yen, the currency ranged between 141.85 yen and 142.20 yen. Currency dealers described the trading as thin, with fewer participants due to the holiday season. A dealer with <ORGANIZATION> Mitsui </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> said there was sporadic buying of <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> currencies, especially the West German mark, through dollar selling, but the buying was not enough to direct the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency. Some investors sold the dollar to buy yen, but `` the dollar remained close to its opening,'' said the dealer, who spoke anonymously. Other dealers said many market players expected a further narrowing of gaps in interest rates between <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. On Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's central bank, raised its official discount rate to 4.25 percent from 3.75 percent to stem inflationary pressure in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. A higher discount rate, the rate the central bank charges on its loans to commercial banks, tends to boost the value of the yen against the dollar. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> discount rate is 7 percent.

 <PERSON> Chevy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chase </PERSON>'s `` National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation'' was the holiday weekend favorite, grossing $ 7 million in ticket sales during the four-day period. Christmas and cold weather kept overall movie business down, according to figures released Tuesday by <ORGANIZATION> Exhibitor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. But the year-end box office will still set an all-time record in excess of $ 5 billion, Exhibitor Relations said. `` Christmas Vacation'' finished ahead of the new adventure movie `` Tango & amp; Cash,'' which pairs <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallone </PERSON> portray as cops who do n't always see eye-to-eye. `` Tango & amp; Cash'' collected a cool $ 6.6 million. In third place with $ 5.5 million was the black comedy `` The War of the Roses,'' featuring <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> as the feuding couple. In fourth was `` Back to the Future Part II,'' with <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, on revenues of $ 4.1 million. `` Always,'' director <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Spielberg </PERSON>'s remake of the 1943 film `` A Guy Named <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>,'' opened in fifth place with $ 3.7 million. In sixth was the animated film `` The Little Mermaid,'' which made $ 3.3 million. In seventh was the ensemble tear-jerker `` Steel Magnolias,'' on $ 2.6 million. `` Blaze,'' the chronicle of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>'s affair with young stripper <PERSON> Blaze </PERSON> <PERSON> Starr </PERSON>, landed in eighth with $ 1.7 million and is the season's biggest flop. `` Family Business,'' starring <PERSON> Dustin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Connery </PERSON>, finished ninth with $ 1.6 million. The baby comedy `` Look Who's Talking,'' was 10th with $ 1.5 million Director <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>'s `` Born on the Fourth of July'' opened strongly in limited release, collecting a per-screen average of $ 39,964 for a total take of $ 172,021. The glib documentary `` Roger & amp; Me'' made $ 84,232 for a good debut on four screens nationwide. `` The Music Box,'' however, did n't play well, netting just $ 19,381 on three screens. Here are the top movie ticket sales for Friday through Monday as tallied by Exhibitor Relations. 1. `` National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation,'' <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION>, $ 7 million weekend gross, 1,950 screens, $ 3,594 per screen, $ 44.1 million total gross, four weeks in release. 2. `` Tango & amp; Cash,'' <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION>, $ 6.6 million, 1,409 screens, $ 4,705 per screen, $ 6.6 million, one week. 3. `` The War of the Roses,'' 20th <ORGANIZATION> Century </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION>, $ 5.5 million, 1,455 screens, $ 3,793 per screen, $ 27.5 million, three weeks. 4. `` Back to the Future Part II,'' Universal, $ 4.1 million, 2,102 screens, $ 1,935 per screen, $ 81.9 million, five weeks. 5. `` Always,'' Universal, $ 3.7 million, 1,016 screens, $ 3,655 per screen, $ 3.7 million, one week. 6. `` The Little Mermaid,'' <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>, $ 3.3 million, 1,513 screens, $ 2,194 per screen, $ 34.1 million, six weeks. 7. `` Steel Magnolias,'' Tri-Star, $ 2.6 million, 1,329 screens, $ 1,950 per screen, $ 34.7 million, six weeks. 8. `` Blaze,'' <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>, $ 1.7 million, 909 screens, $ 1,819 per screen, $ 4.6 million, two weeks. 9. `` Family Business,'' Tri-Star, $ 1.6 million, 1,230 screens, $ 1,275 per screen, $ 4.8 million, two weeks. 10. `` Look Who's Talking,'' Tri-Star, $ 1.5 million, 1,365 screens, $ 1,120 per screen, $ 109.6 million, 11 weeks.

 Medical supplies from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> have been sent to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, and food and clothing are being gathered in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> to help the Central American country recover from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion its resulting civil disorders. `` We realize this is just a small amount of what's needed,'' said <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a cousin of the new <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> president and head of the group, <ORGANIZATION> Help </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION>, which sent the $ 50,000 shipment Tuesday. `` But at this point anything is a help. These supplies are urgently needed.'' The supplies included plasma and antibiotics, syringes and needles, intravenous solutions and orthopedic devices and were to be distributed at <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s two main hospitals. Help <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s first shipment, mostly donated by several south <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> hospitals, filled a chartered twin-engine Lear 25 jet. <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> said a cargo ship with six 40-foot containers of food is expected to leave <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on Friday for the four-day voyage to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, and Help <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> has opened accounts at two <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> banks to take donations. In <LOCATION> Quincy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Preble </PERSON>, a 23-year-old department store statistician, began a drive to collect food and clothing for victims of warfare and looting in the Central American country. `` I'm not a spokesman for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government,'' <PERSON> Preble </PERSON> said, `` But we did what we had to do and now it's our responsibility to clean it up.'' <PERSON> Preble </PERSON> said he was prompted into action Saturday when he phoned his cousin, <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Huff </PERSON>, whose husband, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON>, works as a pilot on the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. They live in <LOCATION> Balboa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, with their three children. Mrs. <PERSON> Huff </PERSON> told <PERSON> Preble </PERSON> that a high school soccer stadium in <LOCATION> Balboa </LOCATION> was filled with about 3,000 people seeking help at a refugee center. <PERSON> Preble </PERSON> felt he had to do something about that. So he enlisted the cooperation from the Quincy mayor's and he put out a call asking donors to bring clothing and non-perishable food to fire stations. Arrangements could also be made to have volunteers collect the goods, he said. On Tuesday, he did n't know how much was collected, and he was still trying to arrange for a military cargo plane to deliver the goods to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Panamanian hospitals have suffered in part because Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s regime used medical supply areas to hide arms, according to <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Dominguez </PERSON>, who on Tuesday was named the Panamanian consul in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` It's going to take a lot more shipments like these to return the hospitals to where they should be,'' said <PERSON> Dominguez </PERSON>.

 At graveside, a yellow bath towel knotted around a rough pine cross and a spray of white chrysanthemums scrounged in a city where even bread is scarce were among tributes to heroes of the revolution. A procession of sobbing families Tuesday accompanied makeshift coffins to a field of 200 freshly dug graves in southern <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>. One coffin was for 14-year-old <PERSON> Silviu </PERSON> <PERSON> Minca </PERSON>, whose friends said he was killed when the nation's hated security police called to them from a window and opened fire when they approached. The security police have killed hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people in in their armed resistance to the uprising that toppled <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>. Officials at <PERSON> Belo </PERSON> cemetery believe 300 to 400 people killed in fighting during the past five days will have to be buried, but perhaps hundreds more are believed hidden in secret graves dug by <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s men before he was overthrown. By a pine cross marked `` first hero,'' a veteran gravedigger named <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Abag </PERSON> wept along with the mourners. `` This is so, so much,'' he said. `` I have not cried here since the earth moved in 1977,'' the year of the earthquake in which almost 2,000 people were killed. At the next grave, people mourned <PERSON> Nicisor </PERSON> <PERSON> Paunoiu </PERSON>, an elevator mechanic who responded when the radio station appealed for help because it was attacked by the Securitate, the security police. <PERSON> Paunoiu </PERSON> and three friends stormed a Securitate stronghold unarmed. Three of them were cut down by automatic weapons fire. He left a son and a daughter who was married three weeks ago. Farther down, there was the student <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON> <PERSON> Urucu </PERSON>, who went to protect the TV station. He joined 3,000 others in a human shield between harassing <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> loyalists and army men protecting the 13-story TV building. <PERSON> Urucu </PERSON>, 21, was shot in the back. `` His death was for all of us, for our freedom,'' student <PERSON> Ileana </PERSON> <PERSON> Nita </PERSON> said as she stood by <PERSON> Urucu </PERSON>'s grave. `` It was a sacrifice we must appreciate. We have to learn what it means to be free and what that is worth.'' Bits of food, round bread rings and bath towels adorned many of the graves, symbols from an ancient tradition of offering things to the dead they may need in the afterlife. Boughs from Christmas trees with long, yellow candles burning were left on many graves and there were photographs of smiling young faces tacked to crosses. The Romanian news agency <ORGANIZATION> Agerpress </ORGANIZATION> said a monument would be erected at the cemetery to pay tribute the revolution's dead for `` their pure sacrifice for <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s freedom.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s key index closed at a record high for the second consecutive day today, while the dollar declined against the Japanese yen for the fifth trading day in a row. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained 257.69 points Tuesday, added another 120.32 points, or 0.31 percent, closing at 38,801.63. Dealers said investors, encouraged by the yen's firmness against the dollar, were buying on a broad front. Surging prices for futures contracts also led to strong expectations of share price gains, they added. Volume traded on the exchange's first section was estimated at 900 million shares, up from 650 million shares Tuesday. The dollar closed at 142.10 yen, down 0.27 yen from Tuesday's finish of 142.37 yen After opening at 142.13 yen, it ranged between 141.85 yen and 142.20 yen. The dollar now has fallen 2.13 yen in five days. Currency dealers described trading as thin with the approaching year-end holiday season. The market is expecting lower <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates, dealers said, while the yen is gaining some support from the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION>'s decision Monday to increase its official discount rate to 4.25 percent from 3.75 percent to stem inflationary pressure Higher interest rates usually make a country's currency more attractive to investors.

<HEAD>Riot Charges Overturned in Second Howard Beach Trial</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A state appeals court has overturned the misdemeanor riot convictions of three young men in the <LOCATION> Howard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> racial killing and dismissed the indictments against them, saying the trial judge committed two errors. Prosecutors either can appeal, resubmit evidence to a grand jury for new indictments or dismiss the case against the three white defendants. `` We are studying the opinion and we are considering a further appeal, and that's as far as we are going to comment at this particular point,'' <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON>, a special assistant attorney general, said Tuesday. The 19-year-old defendants _ <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bollander </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Farino </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Povinelli </PERSON> _ were charged with taking part in the attack on three black men three years ago in the mainly white <LOCATION> Howard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> section of <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>. One of the victims, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON>, was killed when the mob chased him onto a highway where he was struck by a car. The three young men whose convictions were overturned were found guilty in the second trial related to the case. In the first trial, three other white youths were convicted of manslaughter and assault in the fatal attack. Their case is apparently unaffected by the appellate ruling handed down Dec. 11. In overturning the misdemeanor convictions from the second trial, a five-judge panel said the trial judge made two important errors in charging the jury. The panel said the judge, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Demakos </PERSON>, `` over strenuous defense objections,'' furnished the jury with verdict sheets that improperly described some of the alleged crimes. It said the judge also erred by refusing a defense request to instruct the jury on disorderly conduct as a lesser offense of second-degree riot. Defense lawyer <PERSON> Spiros </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsimbinos </PERSON> said he and his clients learned of the ruling Saturday. The Rev. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON>, a community activist who advised the attack victims not to cooperate with investigators until a special prosecutor was appointed, said the ruling was `` an outrageous act. It's a smack in the face of all people, especially black people.'' <PERSON> Farino </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bollander </PERSON> and <PERSON> Povinelli </PERSON> were convicted in 1988 of second-degree riot, but acquitted of a more serious felony riot charge for their roles in the Dec. 20, 1986, attack. <PERSON> Demakos </PERSON> sentenced the three on Sept. 19, 1988, to 34 days in jail to be served on weekends over a four-month period. But they were granted a stay pending appeal and spent no time in jail after their conviction. In July, the appellate panel unanimously upheld the conviction and sentences of the three defendants convicted of manslaughter and assault in the first <LOCATION> Howard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> trial.

 Jews in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and three other countries were brought together by state-of-the-art technology to perform an ancient ritual _ the lighting of the Hanukkah candles. Satellites were used Tuesday to connect gatherings in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Synagogue, <LOCATION> Hyde </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the Champs Elysees in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and at the Western Wall in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Candles for the fifth night of the eight-night holiday were lighted in all five cities, and youths in the locations took turns reading biblical and Talmudic verses. The 90-minute cable television transmission ended with a speech by Rabbi <PERSON> Menachem </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneerson </PERSON>, the leader of the ultra-Orthodox Lubavitcher movement. <PERSON> Schneerson </PERSON> also handed out dimes to hundreds of youngsters at the movement's world headquarters in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> in keeping with the tradition of giving coins, called Hanukkah gelt. The candle in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> was lighted by Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi <PERSON> Mordehai </PERSON> <PERSON> Eliahu </PERSON>, one of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s two chief rabbis. <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> <PERSON> Bodzin </PERSON>, an 18-year-old seminary student from <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, was one of several thousand people who watched the ceremony in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. `` I think it's amazing. Look at all the people here. This one TV show is tying together the Jews from all over,'' she said. Rabbi <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Shemtov </PERSON>, national director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Friends </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lubavitch </ORGANIZATION>, said the ceremony was arranged to mark the 40th anniversary of <PERSON> Schneerson </PERSON>'s leadership of the Lubavitcher movement. Hanukkah commemorates the victory in 165 B.C. of a small band of Jews _ the <ORGANIZATION> Maccabees </ORGANIZATION> _ over the Greco-Syrian kingdom, which tried to impose its culture on the Jews and had desecrated the holy Temple in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. According to legend, when the Jews entered <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and tried to rekindle the Temple's eternal flame, they found enough oil for one day, but the oil miraculously lasted eight days. The $ 150,000 cost of the program was paid by investor <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Perelman </PERSON>, according to <PERSON> Shemtov </PERSON>. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubenstein </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Lubavitchers, said anyone with a home satellite dish could have seen the ceremony.

 High-ranking government officials deny <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allegations that <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has established a route through <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> for shipping arms to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s leftist guerrillas. `` <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has been especially careful to establish facilities in its territory for preventing the situations described,'' a Mexican official said Tuesday on condition of anonymity. In a dispatch from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials believe <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> is shipping weapons across the 130-mile wide <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Channel </LOCATION>, which leads to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s Yucatan peninsula. From there, the arms are loaded on trucks and taken on an unknown route through <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said. One top Mexican official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the claim was `` irresponsible, lacking in credibility and false.'' The official said that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has never brought up the matter officially and that the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> government would have no comment on the record because the claim had been leaked. The Mexican government historically has been sympathetic to the Salvadoran rebels in their decade-old war, but that support has been muted since President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> took office a year ago. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials contend Soviet bloc arms are reaching Salvadoran rebels of the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> through <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, although recent administration statements indicate they do not see the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as the principal villain. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> was looking for new ways to help the rebels and at the same time shield <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Sandinista government from further criticism The Sandinistas were embarrassed in October when a truck carrying arms was intercepted in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and in November when a plane carrying surface-to-air missiles was shot down in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The Salvadoran rebels, who maintain offices in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, refuse to confirm or deny that they receive arms from <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. `` But even if we do, so what?'' said one rebel official. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is helping its own.'' The Mexican official said the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> government has tried to work with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to fight arms and drug trafficking. If there was a problem, this official said, channels created for that purpose should have been used. A Mexican law enforcement official also denied claims that his country was being used to smuggle arms south and noted that the shortest route would take the arms into the resort area of <LOCATION> Cancun </LOCATION>. He said there was some evidence that a route had been established through <LOCATION> Belize </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> peninsula. `` The coast is much less well guarded down there,'' said this official.

<TEXT>
 Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> says his biggest regret as he leaves office is that blacks `` do not perceive that I was their friend.'' `` I believe this administration has been more helpful to the black minority than all administrations before us,'' he said Tuesday. `` I do n't think we got credit for it.'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, who lost his re-election bid to black Democrat <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, spoke at his annual year-end meeting with reporters, the last scheduled news conference of his 12 years in City Hall. He appointed the city's first black police commissioner and the first black deputy mayor for economic development, and under his administration, the percentage of civil service jobs held by members of minority groups grew from 31 percent to 62 percent. Yet, he noted, `` Many people in the black community do not perceive that I was their friend.'' He also discussed his statement during the 1988 presidential campaign that `` Jews and other supporters of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would be crazy'' to vote for <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. The remark caused a black backlash that carried into the 1989 Democratic mayoral primary, when <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> took 97 percent of the black vote. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said the second half of his remark about <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> went unheeded. It was, `` ... in the same way that blacks and supporters of black causes would be crazy to vote for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said he would try to refrain from criticizing <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> for the first six months after he takes office. But the mayor did not refrain from criticizing South African Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, who will speak at <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>' swearing-in. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, who recently criticized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for its handling of the Palestinian uprising and called for a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state, was wrong for `` singling out <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> when it's under attack.'' After 25 years in city and federal government, <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, 65, a former congressman and city councilman, said he wo n't consider re-entering politics. Instead, he'll juggle a half-dozen new jobs _ including commercial endorsements, a newspaper column, radio and TV commentaries and teaching. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said the city is better off than when he took office in 1978 during a fiscal crisis that nearly bankrupted the city. `` I took the city and saved it from bankruptcy,'' he said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> YMCA </ORGANIZATION> is gearing up for a return to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> after more than 70 years of exile. The <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Men </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> has been working with private groups in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> since May to establish branches in at least four cities, said <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> <PERSON> Wroblewski </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> YMCA. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Masuda </PERSON>, director of the international division, will travel there this spring to speak with charitable organizations and citizen groups about opening center in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Novosibirsk </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Omsk </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Wroblewski </PERSON> said. `` We will see <ORGANIZATION> YMCA </ORGANIZATION> programs aimed at developing Soviet citizens' minds, spirits and bodies,'' said <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Goncharoff </PERSON>, director of the American <ORGANIZATION> YMCA </ORGANIZATION>'s statesmanship programs, who first contacted Soviet organizations In addition to the four cities targeted, the organization also might open a branch in <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION>, he said. `` The difference, however, is that they will be called the <ORGANIZATION> YFCA </ORGANIZATION>, for <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Families </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Goncharoff </PERSON>, a Soviet emigre who stayed at a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> YMCA </LOCATION> during his first five months in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1952. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, said he had n't heard about the <ORGANIZATION> YMCA </ORGANIZATION> reopening in his country. `` Nowadays, there are so many organizations and we ca n't know every one of them,'' said <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Parastayev </PERSON>, the embassy's first secretary. `` There is a rise in political activities of the young people, and of course they want to express themselves.'' <PERSON> Goncharoff </PERSON> said the reforms of Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> have made it possible for the <ORGANIZATION> YMCA </ORGANIZATION> to attempt a return. `` Only since <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> could such a historic event be possible,'' he said in a recent interview. `` The last five years, we began to explore actively the idea of <ORGANIZATION> YMCA </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> YMCA </ORGANIZATION> had firm roots in <LOCATION> Czarist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>, with branches mainly devoted to physical activities for young men. But after the 1917 Bolshevik revolution, its doors in <LOCATION> Petrograd </LOCATION> _ now <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> _ and many other cities were shut, <PERSON> Goncharoff </PERSON> said. Today, the organization intends to give Soviet youths training in Western management styles and let them participate in exchanges with American and Canadian youths, he said. `` There is a great excitement for solving community problems in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and that's what the <ORGANIZATION> YMCA </ORGANIZATION> is all about here,'' Ms. <PERSON> Wroblewski </PERSON> said. The organization also plans to offer activities involving music, theater and other arts, <PERSON> Goncharoff </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> YMCA </ORGANIZATION> was founded in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in 1844 as a conduit for religious study.

 He roared like a lion, but when it was time to fight he scurried like a mouse, running from hole to hole as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> paratroopers tried to trap him. `` He repressed us for years and then he humiliated us by giving up without a fight,'' said taxi driver <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>. `` I never supported him, but he should have fought.'' There was no final power play and Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> did n't go down in a blaze of bullets, a fitting end for someone to be romanticized in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> folklore once his political crimes and other sins are forgotten. `` He did not even have the guts to kill himself,'' said housewife <PERSON> Martiza </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>. Instead of the name `` commander of dignity'' his cronies gave him because he stood up to <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said he was the `` commander of indignity.'' Although most Panamanians were opposed to the military strongman who named and fired six presidents like shop supervisors, they almost believed his nationalist rhetoric of fighting to the death. He was said to enjoy a crisis, and it seemed that was the case as he survived threat after threat to his reign. Many expected him to die fighting, to be `` carried out of the barracks face up.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was defiant and mocking when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> indicted him in 1988 on drug trafficking charges. He vowed `` our life for <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'' and said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> accusations were masking designs to renege on the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> treaties and maintain the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military presence in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. For more than a year <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> repressed all dissent, silenced all opposition, survived two coup attempts and got away with annulling the May 7 election his candidates lost. He portrayed himself as <PERSON> David </PERSON> fighting the American Goliath, arms in the air, ever the winner. In the end, even his government-run newspapers and radio stations almost believed the propaganda. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> became a hero, a man who could do no wrong, the savior of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> while the Americans were stupid, their soldiers cowards, drug addicts and AIDS carriers. So his flight to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s embassy on Sunday to seek asylum was an anticlimax not only for his supporters, who hoped he would take to the hills and lead an insurgency war, but also to detractors who wished him dead. `` I did not think he was going to be such a coward,'' said a government official who had sympathized with <PERSON> Noreiga </PERSON> and requested anonymity bacause he wants to keep his job in the new U.S.-backed government. `` It was a big bluff,'' said <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON>, who said she was still `` nervous'' even though <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was closeted in the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> mission. `` I will feel safe when I see him behind bars.'' Many Panamanians felt it was more a question of the Americans suffering him until their patience ran out. That happened on Dec. 16 when members of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s security forces killed an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldier in civilian clothes near <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> military headquarers. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> commander Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON>, a Mexican-American from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> who considered <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> an affront to <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, angrily demanded an explanation and an apology and threatened military reprisal. But when 26,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops invaded the country one week ago, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was surprised. And there were not many in his 15,000-member Defense Forces willing to fight for him. Most units surrendered, although the 1,800 or so who fought back surprised the Americans with their stubborn resistance. But according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> never led the troops in battle. When the first shots were fired, he fled and spent the next six days running from place to place as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers combed the city looking for him and his associates, most of whom were turned in by angry neighbors. And <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> paid a high price. <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Chorrillo </PERSON>, a populous low-income barrio of old wooden structures around the Panamanian military headquarters, was leveled by the guns of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON> tanks. The number of dead in the neighborhood, known for its Friday night street celebrations, will never be known. Moaned taxi driver <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>: `` All those people died because of this coward.''

 Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> has set the stage for a court battle with the federal government by rejecting four permits to study a <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> site's suitability as the nation's first high-level radioactive waste dump. `` This issue will certainly go to court,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said Tuesday after rejecting the permit requests by the federal <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` The Legislature has passed and I have signed bills that make the dump illegal here. `` We can not issue permits allowing the DOE to begin testing a site we have outlawed. They ca n't proceed without these permits.'' <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gertz </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s project manager for the proposed <LOCATION> Yucca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> site 110 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, agreed that <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s action made a court battle inevitible. He said a lawsuit would be filed early next year to obtain the permits. `` It seems strange to us that state officials say <LOCATION> Yucca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> is not suitable for the repository, yet the state will not grant us the permits needed to make that determination scientifically,'' he said. Current plans call for a waste site to be established by the year 2010 to store 70,000 metric tons of radioactive wastes for 10,000 years. <LOCATION> Yucca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> is the only location in the country under consideration. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has no authority to conduct experiments at <LOCATION> Yucca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> without the state's approval. That was blocked earlier this year when the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> passed a bill forbidding the storage of high-level nuclear waste in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>.

 A <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION> tiger bit off a 19-year-old zookeeper's arm as she was giving it water with a hose from outside its cage at a northern <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> safari park, police said today A police official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the attack occurred Tuesday at the <ORGANIZATION> Tohoku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safari </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoo </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fukushima </LOCATION> state, 150 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kimie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagasaku </PERSON>, told police from her hospital bed that she was giving the animal water from outside the cage when it bit off her right arm at the elbow, but she declined to discuss details, the official said. The official said police believed she might have put her hand into the cage as she guided the hose. The tiger could not have reached through the 2-inch space between bars in the cage, he said. <PERSON> Akihiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Ando </PERSON>, a zoo official, said other keepers heard a scream and rushed to the tiger's cage. Ms. <PERSON> Nagasaku </PERSON> had fed the tiger and cleaned its cage daily since April 1, officials said. <PERSON> Ando </PERSON> said it was the first case of anyone being hurt by an animal at the zoo since it opened 11 years ago. There are about 130 carnivorous animals in the zoo and about 1 million people visit it annually, he said.

 A close aide to Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> pleaded innocent to federal charges of drug smuggling, money-laundering and racketeering, saying he chose to surrender to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> so he could stand trial. Lt. Col. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Cid </PERSON> is charged in the same February 1988 indictment that accuses the ousted <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> dictator and leaders of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> drug cartel of importing cocaine into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Cid </PERSON>, 46, commanded a <ORGANIZATION> Panamanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> unit in the province of <LOCATION> Chiriqui </LOCATION> until he gave himself up Saturday to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces that invaded the country to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` I surrendered myself _ I wanted to be brought here,'' del Cid told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoeveler </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on Tuesday. <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Cid </PERSON> strongly denied the charges against him. He then formally pleaded innocent to all four counts and demanded a jury trial. `` He told his troops not to fire, not to engage in any combat, to turn their arms in,'' Assistant Public Defender <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Swartz </PERSON> said after the hearing. `` He did n't want any more bloodshed. It was his desire to surrender to the -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- forces, and to come here to face these charges,'' said <PERSON> Swartz </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> described <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Cid </PERSON> as `` one of the right-hand men of General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>.'' `` We allege -LRB- del Cid -RRB- personally imported shipments of cocaine, and he personally transmitted large amounts of cash,'' <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hoeveler </PERSON> appointed <PERSON> Swartz </PERSON> as del Cid's temporary counsel after the Panamanian testified he had only $ 7,000 with him. <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Cid </PERSON> said he could n't get funds from his <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> savings account, which has been frozen. <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Cid </PERSON> is unemployed, <PERSON> Swartz </PERSON> told the judge, adding, `` His former employer is out of business.'' The judge blocked efforts by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office to ask detailed questions of del Cid in an effort to uncover any additional assets. <PERSON> Hoeveler </PERSON> said such testimony could affect the racketeering counts against the Panamanian. <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Cid </PERSON>, who if convicted could be sentenced to 70 years in prison and fined $ 550,000, was ordered held without bond until a full hearing Jan. 2. The judge also denied a request by prosecutors to block contact between del Cid and <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys. `` Needless to say, we wish to monitor this case to see what's happening, and obviously look at what, if any, evidence the government may have,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubino </PERSON>, one of the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s attorneys in After the hearing, <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> referred all questions about <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and refused to say what contacts his office had made with del Cid. <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> also refused to comment on whether <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Cid </PERSON> has indicated he might testify against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Cid </PERSON>, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, cartel leader <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON> and 12 others are accused in the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> indictment of running drugs and using <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> as a safe haven for traffickers. The indictment alleges that del Cid was used by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as an emissary as <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> allowed the cartel to process drugs, launder money, and ship cocaine through <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. In addition, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is accused of taking a $ 4.6 million bribe from the Colombians. <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Cid </PERSON> is accused of being personally involved in a 400-kilogram cocaine shipment to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in December 1982. He also allegedly picked up $ 100,000 from <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s personal pilot, <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> <PERSON> Cacerez </PERSON> in November 1982, and delivered $ 200,000 to <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> at the military headquarters in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> a month later. <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> is a principal witness in the case.

 A Japanese man was arrested at the international airport trying to smuggle nearly 300 endangered turtles and lizards to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in his suitcases, a police officer said today. <PERSON> Tsuyoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Shirawa </PERSON>, 20, was arrested Sunday after authorities discovered that his four suitcases contained 98 turtles and 185 Oriental water lizards, said police Capt. <PERSON> Paiboon </PERSON> <PERSON> Arinchai </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shiwara </PERSON> told police he brought the reptiles from <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> and stopped in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> to visit a friend en route to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Convicted of possession of endangered wildlife on Monday, <PERSON> Shiwara </PERSON> received a three-month suspended prison sentence and was fined $ 100. <PERSON> Paiboon </PERSON> said the reptiles were tightly packed into the baggage and bound to prevent them from making noise and moving. Two turtles and one lizard died. <PERSON> Boonlerd </PERSON> <PERSON> Angsirijida </PERSON>, a Forestry Department official charged with wildlife conservation, said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was a major market for wildlife from <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Phillipines </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> countries.

 For six months, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cozad </PERSON> had lived with and cared for his grandmother. On Christmas Eve, he died with her in a high-rise retirement home fire that killed 16 and injured dozens. <PERSON> Cozad </PERSON>, 29, who returned to <LOCATION> Johnson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> last summer after working in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, found his grandmother in failing health and moved in with her at the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sevier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retirement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. His 79-year-old grandmother, <PERSON> Carman </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baughan </PERSON>, a retired bookkeeper, suffered from cancer and emphysema. `` She was bedfast and on oxygen,'' said <PERSON> Baughnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brumit </PERSON>, the woman's daughter and <PERSON> Cozad </PERSON>'s mother. `` For the past six weeks, he had more or less waited on her hand and foot.'' `` They were very close and she was getting sicker,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Brumit </PERSON> said. `` He was very caring where she was concerned.'' While authorities continued investigating the cause of the fire in the 11-story center, building residents tried to deal with their feelings about the Christmas Eve disaster. `` It breaks me up to talk about it,'' said <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rankin </PERSON>, who had lived in the center for six months. Mental health professionals have volunteered their time to counsel survivors, said <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, a disaster worker with the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. Red Cross officials said some people have been so upset, they have not been eating. `` I've been torn up about it,'' said <PERSON> Duaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON>, an 11-year resident. <PERSON> Rankin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON> were among 23 people from the center staying at a hotel. Forty-five others are staying with relatives, <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> officials said Tuesday. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Souder </PERSON>, an assistant to Fire Chief <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckles </PERSON>, said investigators do not suspect arson. The fire was the second fatal fire in the center in two months. In October, a 76-year-old resident died of smoke inhalation, but all residents were evacuated. Firefighters quickly extinguished the October blaze through an internal piping system that brought water through the building. By the time firefighters arrived Sunday night, the fire was out of control.

 Warmer weather was making a welcome return to the South today, and a cold front was moving east from the <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, bringing more cold, dry weather.

In much of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, where a Christmas weekend freeze burst water pipes in thousands of homes and businesses, overnight temperatures were at or near freezing. Temperatures today were forecast to rise to the 60s from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> across <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> through <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, and the 40s and 50s in the rest of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s highs could reach 80 by the weekend, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. A cold high-pressure system moved east from <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> today, followed by slightly warmer air. The front was expected to scatter freezing rain and light snow as it moved across the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and Great Lakes into <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. The front was expected to bring dry, sunny and cold weather to the Northeast today, with tempratures from near zero in far northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, rising to the 20s in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, and to the 30s in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>.

 President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will travel to <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> in coming days to try to persuade the republic's defiant <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to reaffirm its allegiance to the national party, officials say. When it declared itself independent on Dec. 20 the <ORGANIZATION> Lithuanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> created the first major crack in the political monopoly forged by <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> attacked the <LOCATION> Lithuanian </LOCATION> party leadership at a meeting of the Soviet party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> held Monday and Tuesday to consider the Lithuanian break with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. He accused the Lithuanians of allowing themselves to become `` hostages to separatists.'' But, in a report published Tuesday in the party newspaper Pravda, he also urged `` maximum restraint'' to allow emotions to cool. The 250-member Central Committee unanimously approved the report. The committee decided to send <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and other top party officials to <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> `` to explain our position and at the same time to get a better sense of the situation there,'' <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>, a Politburo member and the party's chief ideologist, told a news conference afterward. <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> said some officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting proposed ousting the Lithuanians from the national party or annulling the Lithuanian decision, but others pushed more moderate measures. All were united, however, in their disapproval of the Lithuanian move, <PERSON> Mededev </PERSON> said. `` Most agreed that this was a blow to perestroika,'' he said, referring to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s program to restructure the Soviet economy and to a certain extent the political system. <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> said the trip to <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> would take place `` in not very many days'' and that the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> will make a firm decision on the dispute in January. The Lithuanian Communist leader, <PERSON> Algirdas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brazauskas </PERSON>, said in an interview that the party officials' visit would be `` good and helpful,'' an editor at Lithuanian Radio said. Despite the postponement of a full decision, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s stand as stated Tuesday refused to recognize the <LOCATION> Lithuanian </LOCATION> party's self-proclaimed independent status. `` No part of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has the right to decide the question about its independent existence with its own program and rules, not taking into account the position of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> as a whole,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said in the report approved by the plenum. `` And this means that the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> was and remains a part of the united <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> tried for several months to head off the Lithuanian split. At the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> meeting in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Saturday he lashed out at separatists: `` Today, to realize the right to self-determination through secession means to blow up the union, set the people against each other and sow conflict and blood and death.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting the Soviet government should consider the legal status of movements that are `` carrying out separatist activities and whipping up nationalist terror.'' He did not identify any such organizations, but in the context of the debate he likely was referring to <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>'s people's front, known as <ORGANIZATION> Sajudis </ORGANIZATION>, and other groups pushing for independence from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> said the fight against separatist groups would not involve the use of force by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` We're against application of the military or other such methods,'' he said. Thousands of people gathered Tuesday in <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>'s capital, for a rally in support of the regional party's move, said <ORGANIZATION> Lithuanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> editor <PERSON> Eduardas </PERSON> <PERSON> Potasinskas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brazauskas </PERSON>, in an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Interfax </ORGANIZATION> news service published Tuesday, defended his party's decision as a `` step toward renewal of the party.'' `` The idea is to make sure that the public perceives it as a new political force with a new message,'' he said. <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>, however, said the <LOCATION> Lithuanian </LOCATION> party would end up `` crushed by separatist and nationalist forces'' without <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s support Despite <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s bluster, <PERSON> Brazauskas </PERSON> and other <LOCATION> Lithuanian </LOCATION> party leaders maintain that the Soviet leader has shown understanding of their move.

 <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s Princess <PERSON> Ileana </PERSON>, now a nun at an Orthodox monastery in rural western <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, said her homeland was saved `` in the nick of time'' by a revolution she never thought she'd live to see. `` I always believed my prayers would be answered,'' the Rev. <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexandra </PERSON> said Tuesday. The 80-year-old daughter of King <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> and <PERSON> Queen </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON>, and great-granddaughter of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s Queen <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> and <PERSON> Czar </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>, said her European contacts told her ousted President <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> had to die. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Elena </PERSON>, were executed by a firing squad Monday following conviction by a secret military tribunal. The former Communist leader and his wife had been captured Saturday, a day after a popular uprising forced him from power. He was denounced as the `` Antichrist'' and accused of killing 60,000 people. `` They said 60,000 is enough ... and it -LRB- execution -RRB- had to be done because it would have gone on and on and on,'' <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexandra </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from the Orthodox Monastery of the Transfiguration near <LOCATION> Ellwood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` They had to do it, so they tell me. I personally have no opinion.'' <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexandra </PERSON>'s father was king from 1914 until his death in 1927. Her nephew, King <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, was forced to abdicate by the communists in 1947 and lives in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. `` I did n't expect the whole thing, I must say. I've lived with it so long. It's been 42 years since I left,'' she said. `` The strength of the country has always been in its peasantry. That's what <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> was destroying. I hope there is enough of them left and enough intellectuals left to be able to build again.'' Princess <PERSON> Ileana </PERSON> was exiled from <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> with the rest of the royal family soon after King <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>'s abdication in December 1947. She immigrated with her husband, an archduke of <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, and their six children to <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and then <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> before settling in 1950 in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The move ultimately led to divorce. She ended a second marriage to become a postulant, or a candidate for the religious order, in 1961. Six years later, she took her monastic vows and put up a trailer outside <LOCATION> Ellwood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to began building an English-speaking monastery for Orthodox women of all ethnic backgrounds. <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexandra </PERSON> said she has spent much of the past week on the telephone with friends and relatives in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, keeping abreast of developments and consoling friends of the many who died in the uprising. She said that even with the changes elsewhere in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> she did not expect such quick, drastic moves in her homeland. `` Quite honestly, I was feeling very depressed about it,'' she said. `` I thought everybody was doing something but nothing was moving in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> at all. And suddenly, it blew up.'' <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexandra </PERSON> said she is working with the Romanian <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episcopate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, to organize a Save <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> Fund. She also plans a special service at the monastery this week for <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s dead. She said she would consider returning to <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> `` if I could be of use.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> said today it was lodging an urgent complaint with the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> about <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s latest ground and air attacks that reportedly killed 12 people and wounded 31 The attacks, which occurred 12 hours apart on Tuesday, destroyed two guerrilla bases of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in central and southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>' office said instructions were being transmitted to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mission to complain of `` this blatant aggression.'' The office said <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> would not ask for a council debate. Israeli paratroopers backed by tanks and helicopter gunships destroyed one guerrilla base in southeast <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> before dawn, and warplanes blasted a command post of the same group at sunset further to the north. Rescuers worked under spotlights overnight to dig out victims from the rubble of the two-story command post in the coastal town of <LOCATION> Rmeile </LOCATION>, 20 miles south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Police said the final casualty toll of the Rmeile attack stood at 10 killed and 28 wounded, the heaviest among <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 18 air raids into <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this year. Twenty-eight people have been killed and 137 wounded in the 18 air strikes since Jan. 11. Two Communist guerrillas were killed and three wounded in the earlier ground assault on the base in the southeastern village of <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Safi </PERSON>. The assault, staged by 100 paratroopers backed by four tanks and eight armored personnel carriers, was the Israeli army's heaviest ground advance into <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since an assault on the Syrian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> on Dec. 9, 1988. The attack force advanced from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-proclaimed border zone, a two - to 15-mile wide buffer zone north of the Israeli border, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the Israeli-allied <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> have controlled since 1982 The Communists have been blamed for several terrorist attacks in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as well as the attempted assassination in November 1988 of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> commander. Elsewhere in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, rival Shiite Moslem militias battled into a fifth day today in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Police said eight people were killed and 37 wounded in artillery and tank fire duels Tuesday and early today between the fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> and the Syrian-backed Amal militia. That raised the overall toll to 46 killed and 187 wounded since the current round of fighting began Saturday. The two factions have been vying for mastery of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 1.2 million Shiites, the country's largest sect, for more than two years. The overall toll of the intermittent power struggle since May 1987 stands at 617 killed and 1,766 wounded.

<BYLINE>By FRANCES D'EMILIO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> said today there is no legal way its embassy in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> can hand over Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities. <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> also said the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> had not discussed with any countries the possibility of arranging exile for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who turned himself in to the <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on Sunday. <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> told a news conference that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> took refuge after the papal nuncio, or ambassador to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, agreed to let the ousted dictator stay in the embassy. He arrived there five days after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops invaded <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in an effort to capture <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and restore the elected government. Asked about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demands that the embassy directly turn over <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities, <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> said there was no legal way that could be done. He said the embassy is empowered to deal only with the government of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and no other foreign government. The Panamanian government has not made any request for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> added. He said the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> were working together to find a legal solution satisfactory to both sides. `` We're dealing with a complex problem whose various elements can not be ignored. These elements include legal considerations, diplomatic, humanitarian and therefore ethical ones,'' he said in a statement. Asked about reports of hard feelings between the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> said, `` There has been no element at all that could be called a situation of strain, tension, misunderstanding.'' He said meetings between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials on the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> case `` have taken place from the beginning in a clear and very cordial climate.'' The comments contrasted with reports from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, where a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> source said Monday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had demanded `` in extraordinarily tough terms'' that the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> turn over <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where he faces drug charges. Earlier this week, <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> virtually ruled out the possibility <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> would simply be turned over to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities as demanded by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials have said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> will probably be granted exile in a third country. However, <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> had not been in contact with any countries about the possibility of offering <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> exile and said it was too soon to talk about that. <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> said three other Panamanians arrived at the embassy Sunday with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. He identified them only as a military captain, his wife, and another military official. He said the Holy See believes the matter can be resolved in `` days, not weeks'' but provided no evidence of progress in talks on the fate of the deposed Panamanian strongman.

<HEAD>Queen Mary Officer May Be Next Fired by Disney for Refusing To Shave</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The first officer of the Queen <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> said he'll probably be the next to walk the plank following firings of two waiters whose mustaches ran afoul of a <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> grooming code. First Officer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Magness </PERSON> said he planned to keep the mustache he has worn for 42 years while serving on ships around the world. `` I'm going to work, punch in as usual, and if they want to fire me, they can find me and fire me,'' <PERSON> Magness </PERSON>, 65, said Tuesday, adding that he would fight the anticipated dismissal in court. Waiters <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Nazertehrani </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicolai </PERSON> were dismissed Christmas Eve for refusing to shave facial hair forbidden by <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the leaseholds on the permanently docked ocean liner in <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. `` I got a beautiful present from the <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> corporation _ my pink slip,'' said <PERSON> Nazertehrani </PERSON>, a 12 -LCB- - year Queen <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> employee <PERSON> Nicolai </PERSON>, 26, said the 35-year-old Disney policy barring facial hair is out of date. Both men said they would file union grievances protesting their dismissals. The grooming code bans mustaches, beards and long hair on men. Bright eye shadow, red fingernails or two-toned hair for women are forbidden. <PERSON> Nazertehrani </PERSON>, 43, said the issue involved more than appearance. `` I am Iranian,'' he said. `` This mustache is part of my culture. It is a thing of pride.'' Five or fewer Queen <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> workers have lost their jobs for refusing to shave, said <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerlin </PERSON>, a spokesman for the tourist attraction. He said the firing of <LOCATION> Nazertehrani </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Nicolai </PERSON> on Christmas Eve was an accident of scheduling. Disney bought rights to the ship a couple years ago, but only imposed its companywide dress and grooming codes on it recently in conjunction with a promotional campaign. `` I think the initial reluctance people expressed has subsided. It was controversial for only a week or two,'' <PERSON> Kerlin </PERSON> said. The no-facial hair restriction puzzles some who recall that <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> sported a mustache.

<TEXT>
 Afghan refugees today rallied in several Pakistani camps to mark the 10th anniversary of the Soviet intervention in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Also today, Western diplomats in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> said the latest reports indicate the Communist government, which the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> left behind in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in February, has arrested more than 200 people in a recent coup plot. Tens of thousands of Afghan guerrillas and their supporters burned effigies and listened to impassioned speeches at refugee camps around the Pakistani frontier city of <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>, where several U.S.-backed rebel groups are based. They vowed to keep fighting for the downfall of President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> and pledged to replace his Marxist administration with a guerrilla-run, Moslem government. About 100,000 Soviet troops intervened in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 to replace one pro-Moscow government with another. They stayed on to help fight the insurgency that began when the Afghan Communists seized power in 1978. Soviet forces fought the guerrillas for nine years before completing a phased withdrawal Feb. 15. The <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> continues massive military supplies to the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government. The Moslem rebels are supported by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The Communists still hold <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s major cities, but the guerrillas control most of the countryside. <PERSON> Gulbaddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>, leader of the hard-line <ORGANIZATION> Hezb-i-Islami </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla group, told a crowd of supporters at the Hyatabad refugee camp near <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION> today that his party would never enter a coalition with the Communists. `` We believe that only the cessation of delivery of arms to the crumbling <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> regime will seal the fall of this disgusting regime,'' <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> said. He also has accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of interfering with his aims. Western diplomats in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the ruling <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Afghanistan </ORGANIZATION> has arrested more than 200 people in the latest outbreak of factional infighting in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. Officials in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> reported only the arrest of about 100 clandestine <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> supporters earlier this month. However, Western diplomats allege that it was a coup plot among members of the Afghan army. In recent years, the governing `` <ORGANIZATION> Parcham </ORGANIZATION>'' wing of <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s party has survived several conspiracies by the `` Khlaq'' faction, which is dominated by the military. An estimated 2 million Afghans have fled the civil war to neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and 1 million went to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The head of a new East German opposition party today withdrew from talks between <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s coalition government and other opposition groups after he was accused of corruption. The announcement came as the talks, which concern the future course of the country, resumed today after a Christmas break. <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnur </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Awakening </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, was accused in the newspaper <PERSON> Junge </PERSON> <PERSON> Welt </PERSON> of using his position to obtain a large apartment that originally had been allocated to a family with several children. The 45-year-old lawyer denied the allegations but said he was withdrawing from the talks until the matter had been clarified. He said he was the target of a `` massive campaign'' aimed at discrediting him and his party politically, and he claimed his mother, who is Jewish, has received threats from neo-Nazis. <PERSON> Schnur </PERSON>, elected chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Awakening </ORGANIZATION> earlier this month when the opposition group met to constitute itself as a political party, said he would seek a vote of confidence from the party board. Since the fall of hard-line <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> on Oct. 18, East Germans have been intent on rooting out corruption. Most such allegations have centered on the top levels of the now-ousted <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leadership. East German leaders have instituted dizzying changes following protests by hundreds of thousands of people for democratic reform. It opened the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall as part of loosened travel restrictions in November, promised free elections and called for the talks between Communist and opposition leaders. <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>'s successor, <ORGANIZATION> Egon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>, also resigned as president and a non-Communist replaced him in a new coalition government, which includes the Communists and four traditionally allied parties. Communist Premier <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> is handling day-to-day affairs until the free elections. The talks involve 37 representatives from five established political parties, including the Communists, and representatives of 16 opposition groups. The discussion group is acting as a watchdog group on <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON>'s government until the elections May 6 <PERSON> Junge </PERSON> <PERSON> Welt </PERSON>, a youth-oriented newspaper once closely allied with the Communists, made the allegations against <PERSON> Schnur </PERSON>. <PERSON> Schnur </PERSON>'s party has maintained close contacts with West German officials but is split on the question of reunification. It has also called for a free market system in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, although there is a dispute on this topic as well. His movement has existed as a party for only two weeks, and its national influence is still hard to assess. <PERSON> Schnur </PERSON> said he would sue the newspaper, which has become increasingly independent and aggressive in its reporting. <PERSON> Schnur </PERSON> also said his mother received anonymous letters containing threats from neo-Nazis. East German leaders have said they are on guard against a possible rise in nationalist and neo-Nazi groups, as a result of the turmoil gripping the Communist country.

Sterling was released without being booked, but the case was handed over to the district attorney's office for possible misdemeanor charges of cruelty to animals or discharging a weapon in city limits, <PERSON> Benaske </PERSON> said. Sterling was on his rounds when he allegedly shot Skippy with a 22-caliber weapon from the driveway while the dog was about 15 feet away on the sidewalk, police said. Ms. <PERSON> Brody </PERSON> said she had just stepped to the door to give the letter carrier a bottle of vodka tied with a green bow. Sterling, a letter carrier in the neighborhood for about four years, told police he had been bitten by Skippy and had complained about the animal to postal officials, <PERSON> Benaske </PERSON> said. But Ms. <PERSON> Brody </PERSON> said <PERSON> Sterling </PERSON> had gotten along well with the dog. `` He was a very friendly dog. The mailman knows him _ he watched him grow. I do n't know why he would do that -LRB- shoot the dog -RRB-. He's a very nice man,'' she said. Postal officials said the matter was under investigation.

 More countries today joined the major powers in recognizing <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s new government, and millions of dollars in medical supplies and food were pledged to help the country recover from its bloody revolution. More than 20 countries have recognized <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s provisional <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which took charge Friday when the popular revolt toppled President <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which violently crushed a pro-democracy movement in the spring, today congratulated <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s new leaders. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> was one of the only world leaders to support <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s crackdown. Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> gave his personal support to <PERSON> Ion </PERSON> <PERSON> Iliescu </PERSON>, the chief of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s new provisional government and an acquantance from their college days. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> said it would send $ 1 million following an appeal by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> for $ 4 million in medical relief. The Japanese <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> sent medical supplies worth about $ 700,000 to <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> and committed a six-member medical team to help the wounded. The <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> said today that it would send eight tons of medical supplies, food and equipment, and it began a fund-raising campaign to match a cash donation of about $ 43,000 promised by the Irish government. An Israeli military spokesman said a plane loaded with six to eight tons of medicine, bandages and equipment and two Romanian-speaking surgeons left for <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> today. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> said its post office would send free aid packages to any `` identified recipient'' in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> until January. In a separate statement, the government said that besides two planeloads of medical aid sent Saturday, about 20 planeloads had been sent by non-governmental organizations, including 100 tons of medical supplies and 60 doctors and nurses. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration said Tuesday it was providing $ 500,000 to buy medical supplies. A score of countries including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> recognized <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s provisional government over the past several days and more joined in today. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> formally announced its support for the new Romanian leaders and condemned the mass slayings by forces allied with <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>. The statement by Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> was the first time <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> openly criticized <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, who had been highly regarded in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for maintaining a longstanding alliance with the Jewish state. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s contratulatory message was carried in the government daily <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> and was strikingly informal, signed simply <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, with no title. Accenting the unusual recognition of an informal government was a shorter announcement immediately below, signed by the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION>, congratulating Petre Roman on becoming the Romanian prime minister. <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> sent a congratulatory telegram to <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s newly appointed leader, <PERSON> Ion </PERSON> <PERSON> Iliescu </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Henrik </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunn </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON> `` prayed that ongoing changes will be without further loss of life,'' the official <ORGANIZATION> Zambia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. Assistant Secretary General <PERSON> Adnan </PERSON> <PERSON> Amran </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> was quoted as telling <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Dhabi </PERSON>'s state-run newspaper Al-Ittihad that the changes in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> were `` respected by all <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states because they express the will of the Romanian people.'' <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s Communist daily Rude Pravo said the Cabinet recognized <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday and praised the army's decision to support the people. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was among several countries that criticized the new government for trying and executing the <ORGANIZATION> Ceausescus </ORGANIZATION> in secret. Today, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s liberal <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> daily newspaper said the actions violated democratic principles. `` Granted, though, that the couple had committed great crimes, it remained a categorical imperative of democracy to go through the legitimate legal procedure and give the verdict of guilty,'' it said. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> today also criticized the secret trial while supporting the new Romanian government. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mail </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said the criticisms `` come easy from the comfort of Western armchairs.'' `` Such advice takes little account of the necessities imposed by a civil war. ... While <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> stayed alive, his Securitate -LRB- secret police -RRB- had every incentive to carry on fighting and killing in the hope of restoring him to power,'' the paper said. The British government has said it regretted the trial and killings. <PERSON> Iolanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Stranescu </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Romania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> should have had a public trial. `` It is difficult at this range to know all the reasons for the execution. Maybe it was security. Perhaps at a public trial too much information might have come out about people who want to be involved in the new government,'' <PERSON> Stranescu </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> deserved more time to answer the charges against him. `` Those who tried the deposed head of state have proved themselves overefficient in their performance. They seem to have handed down a preordained death verdict to the accused without judging its merit under the accepted canons of justice,'' it said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> obtained confidential files about industry whistleblowers during a fraud investigation, documents filed by an aerospace worker in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> allege. The documents claim that <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> officials sought information on aerospace workers who complained of alleged fraud and safety problems in the space shuttle program, The <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday. <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> has denied the allegations in filings in the lawsuit. The company has no further comment because the litigation is pending, spokeswoman <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> said at the corporation's headquarters in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Segundo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION> The lawsuit claims <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> used information it collected _ and some of the law enforcement agencies that provided it _ in a campaign of intimidation against whistleblowers that began after the 1986 Challenger explosion. `` It is just beyond my wildest beliefs,'' said <PERSON> Ria </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>, who contends in her lawsuit that <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> stepped up a pattern of harassment after she filed a civil rights lawsuit against the company. `` Something like this should not happen in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' she told the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> obtained information ranging from court documents and police reports open to the public to personal data and criminal histories kept on a computer network reserved for law enforcement agencies, the court documents allege. Ms. <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> said she and her mother received threatening telephone calls and that phone lines and an electrical fuse box at her home were destroyed after she reported illegalities in the shuttle program. The court documents filed included depositions from other whistleblowing employees. Ms. <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> claims she lost her job at <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 because she objected to fraud and safety violations that could endanger a space shuttle crew. <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION>, a subcontractor for <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a Houston-based subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, is responsible for developing and distributing computer software for the shuttle program. <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> is the primary contractor for the shuttle construction.

 Heating oil futures jumped higher again today in early trading, continuing the trend that accelerated after a weekend explosion at the nation's second-largest petrochemical plant. Heating oil futures prices had surged Tuesday in the wake of the blast at the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> refinery at <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>. The accident at the plant, which normally produces about 4.4 million gallons of heating oil daily, aggravated a price spike caused by the record-setting cold snap that has hit much of the nation and raised the prospect of further spot oil shortages. The explosion Christmas Eve killed two people and shattered windows in buildings as far as six miles away. The second body was recovered Tuesday. An investigation has yet to determine the cause of the blast. Supplies of home heating oil already were tight before the explosion and the accelerated demand has pushed retail prices as high as $ 1 a gallon in some areas. Wholesale prices also have surged, as reflected by the futures market. Heating oil for January delivery, up 10.74 cents on Tuesday, jumped another 4.02 cents to 96.50 cents a gallon in early trading today on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Crude oil and gasoline futures also rose, adding to gains made Tuesday in thin trading. Markets were closed Monday for Christmas. The February contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, was up 5 cents at $ 21.96 a barrel in early trading, following Tuesday's 62-cent rise. Unleaded regular gasoline for January, up 5.49 cents on Tuesday, rose 0.06 cent to 61 cents a gallon in early trading today. `` There's no stopping prices for the short term until the temperatures warm up,'' said <PERSON> Dillard </PERSON> <PERSON> Spriggs </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Analysis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> affiliate, reported last week that some of their terminals in the Northeast suffered temporary oil shortages and customers were sent to other suppliers or forced to wait for new shipments. On Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Maneri </PERSON> said further information on the shortages was unavailable. <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION>'s offices were closed for the holiday and telephone calls went unanswered. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> said the company would n't have any problems supplying contract volumes of heating oil to customers `` There is some flexibility in the network,'' he said. The company has about a week before supplies become a problem, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said, noting that <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> can increase heating oil production at its refineries in <LOCATION> Baytown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Linden </LOCATION>, <PERSON> N.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said it was impossible to predict when the <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION> refinery would begin operating normally again. He said the crippled plant made a large heating oil shipment to the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> on Saturday and had n't planned to supply the region again until after Jan. 1. But oil traders appeared skeptical. `` The market's factoring in a lot more than that,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON>, assistant director of the energy group at <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The futures market is betting it will take <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> five days or more to get the <ORGANIZATION> Baton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> refinery operating normally again, <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON> said.

 Thousands of people across the South were left without water or found their taps producing a trickle too weak for a decent shower because the Christmas weekend freeze cracked pipes. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> plumbers called for out-of-state reinforcements, hotels with water offered special rates to folks desperate to bathe, and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> trucked water in to <LOCATION> Pollock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>. `` It's unbelievable, unbelievable,'' said <PERSON> Bennie </PERSON> <PERSON> Payne </PERSON>, who was busy dispatching plumbers from his Central Plumb It Yourself Supply in <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>. `` Our guys are working till they drop. I do n't know how much longer they can keep up this pace. However, in one of the hardest hit cities, <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, officials said today that they were making rapid progress toward fixing the broken pipes and restoring normal service. From <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, a strange sort of spring thaw followed the rare weekend freeze: Pipes, unprotected from the cold, cracked open as freezing water expanded, then began dripping and gushing as temperatures rose Monday and Tuesday. The worst of the South's cold wave appeared over, with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> predicting lows today at or above freezing in much of the region and rising to the 50s and 60s today and Thursday. Elsewhere, freezing rain was forecast today across the Plains and light snow from the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> east into <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, western <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state and into <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. The wintry weather has been blamed for the deaths of 97 people since Dec. 15. The cold destroyed much of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s valuable citrus crop and froze an estimated 65 percent of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' oranges and grapefruit on the trees. <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> fishermen were astounded to see ice in the shallows where they earn their living. `` We have banks that are solid white with fish and frozen fish floating everywhere,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Buras </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fishermen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plaquemines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parish </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have islands with ice sticking 2 or 3 feet high and bays that are frozen solid. `` It looks like <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> it's so bad right now.'' Particularly hard-hit with water problems were <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, with an estimated 60,000 homes and businesses left dry, and <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, where one official guessed the number affected may have topped 100,000. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> officials asked laundries, car washes and other businesses that use large amounts of water to stay closed a second day today, and non-essential government workers were ordered to stay home. Residents who had water were warned to boil it for three minutes to kill germs that are a threat when levels are low. Low pressure also hampered firefighters' in battling blazes. However, <PERSON> Mayor </PERSON> <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> <PERSON> Ditto </PERSON> said today that conditions were quickly returning to normal. `` We are in much better shape this morning,'' Ditto said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America.'' `` We suspect that about 20 percent of the homes might now be out of water and hopefully those will be back up sometime during the day.'' Ditto said 10 crews were restoring service to the remainder of 150 major breaks reported since Saturday. <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> residents hankering for showers were obliged _ at $ 25-a-douse _ in the downtown Holiday Inn and the Ramada Inn near the Astrodome. Low pressure plagued much of the city and homeowners found waiting lists as long as two weeks for plumbers. The <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plumbing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, with a backlog of 2,000 trouble calls, was recruiting out-of-state plumbers to bolster its staff of 28, said <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON>, sales manager. Plumbing breaks also caused problems in places including <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, Mobile, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Meridian </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ashley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Singletary </PERSON> said her water pressure was so low it took 45 minutes to run a sinkful to wash the dishes. `` The shower, you ca n't soap yourself down because it wauld take you three hours to get the soap off,'' Ms. <PERSON> Singletary </PERSON> said. `` Washing your hair is out of the question.'' More serious problems abounded. Four National Guard trucks from <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beauregard </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, hauled 6,000-gallon water trailers to the desperately dry town of <LOCATION> Pollock </LOCATION>. Water gushing from broken pipes ruined 240,000 pounds of food intended for distribution to the needy, said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Prado </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. Cold-caused property damage in the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> area, most of it from broken pipes, could total $ 25 million, an insurance industry group predicted. Among <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> businesses with water damage was The Hard Rock Cafe, where a pipe broke, pumping 900,000 gallons of water into the basement Christmas Day. `` We lost all our food, computers and amplifiers,'' said assistant general manager <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>. `` It was pretty brutal.''

 When American wounded began arriving last week from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, Maj. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and hospital staff quickly realized that the injured soldiers' families were going to need help, too. `` The military does things differently than other people do,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> observed Tuesday. For the families of the wounded, particularly those unfamiliar with the military bureaucracy, `` it was something of a culture shock,'' he said. For instance, families had to apply for identification badges before seeing their loved ones, and could not visit them without an escort. `` We're more structured to protect the privacy of the patient than a civilian hospital,'' said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a clinical social worker. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, the chairman of the social work department at <ORGANIZATION> Wilford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, and others established a reception center to help the visiting families deal with wounds and injuries to their sons and husbands. About 250 wounded soldiers have been treated at <LOCATION> Wilford </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Brooke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> since the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> last week. Many soldiers have been released or transferred to their home bases. Tuesday marked the first day in a week that military hospitals did not receive wounded soldiers from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, and today there were 41 soldiers at <LOCATION> Wilford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION> and 17 across town at <ORGANIZATION> Brooke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will visit the wounded soldiers Sunday, the White House said. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 42, said the sight of loved ones being reunited with those wounded in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> recalled the return of American hostages from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in January 1981. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was assigned to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hospital in <LOCATION> Wiesbaden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where the newly freed hostages were taken for observation and treatment before returning to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Both the hostages returning from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the soldiers wounded in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> were very emotional. `` It was the same sense of relief that they had survived,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. He said the soldiers from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and the hostages behaved similarly, concentrating on televised news accounts of the event of which they were part. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said the hospital and volunteers have been working hard to help families of casualties through reception centers staffed by a clinical social workers and two mental health technicians. He said the first thing family members want to do is to see their loved ones. Regardless of the wound or injury, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said, relatives must be accompanied by a hospital staff person or volunteer during that initial encounter to give them whatever emotional support they may need. `` We do n't let them go up by themselves,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 The Nicaraguan government will not allow a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plane carrying supplies for its embassy to land as scheduled next month, the official newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Barricada </ORGANIZATION> reported today. Barricada, the organ of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, said the monthly flight that supplies the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy is scheduled to arrive Jan. 11. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Escoto </PERSON> informed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> on Tuesday night that the measure was taken because <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces would not allow Nicaraguan planes to land in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and had surrounded the Nicaraguan Embassy in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Barricada </PERSON> said. Civil aviation was halted in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces invaded last week to oust dictator <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops later surrounded the Nicaraguan, <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> and Libyan embassies to prevent <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> from seeking refuge there. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> chose instead to seek refuge in the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> embassy. Last week, Nicaraguan troops surrounded the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> in response to the blockade of the Nicaraguan Embassy in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Barricada </PERSON> said about 165 Nicaraguans and two <PERSON> Aeronica </PERSON> planes have been trapped in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> since the Dec. 20 invasion. It quoted the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> as demanding that the Nicaraguans and the Nicaraguan planes be permitted to leave today and said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> supply plane would not be allowed to land before Jan. 26 if the demands were not met. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Falino </PERSON>, contacted by telephone, said he had no comment on the matter.

<HEAD>Guilty Plea of Marijuana Broker Caps Sting Operation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A man prosecutors called the biggest single broker of Southeast Asian marijuana pleaded guilty to smuggling nearly 200 tons into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> over a four-year period. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>, 43, appeared before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Coughenour </PERSON> on Tuesday to plead guilty to one count of operating a continuing criminal enterprise and two counts of conspiracy to import and distribute marijuana. <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> native who had lived in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> for about 10 years until his 1988 arrest in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, could be sentenced to life in prison and fined up to $ 6.25 million. Sentencing was set for May 25. <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> is being held without bail in the <LOCATION> Pierce </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> admitted in court documents that he masterminded some of the biggest marijuana shipments from <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from 1984 to 1988. The shipments included multiton deliveries to <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Among them was the shipment of 72 tons of high-grade Laotian marijuana seized in June 1988 aboard the Encounter Bay, an oil-supply vessel, off the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> coast. `` As far as I'm aware he was the single biggest broker of Southeast Asian marijuana,'' said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON>. The guilty plea was part of an agreement in which some charges in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, were packaged into a single plea agreement filed in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. The guilty plea capped a `` sting'' operation by the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, in which <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agents in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> collaborated to ensnare <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>. Dozens of other defendants have been prosecuted in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> and arrest warrants have been issued for other key figures who are still fugitives. Swiss police and <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agents arrested <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> in July 1988 in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, where he had gone for medical treatment.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> today asked authorities in four European countries to freeze bank accounts where it believes ousted <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> stashed millions of dollars in illegal drug profits. `` We have taken steps today in four <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> countries to freeze assets in numerous'' accounts, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON>, the department's chief spokesman Officials say <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> hid at least $ 10 million in the accounts. As the department sought to gain control of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s money, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> negotiated with the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>, whose embassy in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> took in an exhausted <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and 10 associates sought asylum Sunday. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s regime was toppled on Dec. 20 by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials sent letters to authorities in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> asking them to halt transactions in the bank accounts belonging to the deposed Panamanian dictator, <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. The actions were taken under international treaty agreements that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has with the foreign nations, he said. Based on records seized in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, which was invaded by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops on Dec. 20, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials believe they can document that the money in the overseas accounts stemmed from <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s alleged drug dealing, <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. `` We will have to demonstrate to the banking officials'' that the money was earned illegally, he added. He said `` preliminary discussions'' were under way with other countries where <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has money. While the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is trying to freeze $ 10 million, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> estimates <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s worth at about $ 200 million to $ 300 million. In a speech last August, Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> alluded to multimillion-dollar transactions <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has made over the past two years involving accounts in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>. Justice attorneys are confident that banking officials in the four <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> countries will cooperate with their request. `` We've had a remarkable display of international cooperation,'' <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said But he added there is a possibility that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, his family or his bankers have already transferred the money out of the accounts since the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion. Freezing the accounts if the first step in a process to seize the assets, <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. Distribution of the money, however, would be governed by the laws of the countries where the cash is hidden. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, meanwhile, told reporters today he did not think that he or the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government would be embarrassed if information about <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s past links to the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> came out during a trial of the Panamanian. `` I think that's history and I think the main thing is he should be tried and brought to justice,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` And we are pursuing that course with no fear of that. `` You know, you may get into some release of certain confidential documents that he may try to blindside the whole justice process. But the system works, so I would n't worry about that.'' President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, said earlier that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> can talk `` until he's blue in the face'' about his links with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>. The spokesman was referring to things <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> might reveal about his past close ties with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, including the period in the 1970s when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> headed the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>. `` It wo n't hurt anything,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> added. `` We want <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> here because he would cause trouble wherever he goes ... We want him in a nice jail cell where we can keep an eye on him,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters aboard <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> One en route with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to a fishing and hunting vacation in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, Gen. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurman </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, met face-to-face three times with Monsignor <PERSON> Sebastian </PERSON> <PERSON> Laboa </PERSON>, the papal nuncio, on the street outside the embassy. Less public diplomatic channels also were used to communicate with the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>, though <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has not contacted Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>. While <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops ringed the <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> to block <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> from leaving, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> indicated the soldiers could be in for a long wait. `` It could be that they'll -LRB- the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> -RRB- have a long-term resident in their embassy in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION>, along with national security adviser <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> and Gen. <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, briefed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> situation at Camp David, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, on Tuesday. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>, which has no extradition treaty with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, has refused to hand over <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Sources in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> said the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> would rather turn <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> over to a third country, while another possibility is having <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> stand trial in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said administration officials have not ruled out various options, although the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy is that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> should be brought to trial in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Should the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> receive custody of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, he would be brought first to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> for an initial court appearance. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would keep troops around the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> embassy `` as long as he's there.'' While <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials rejected the idea that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> be given political asylum, one expert said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s fate is in the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s hands. `` Asylum in an embassy is well recognized,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Hargrove </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION>. `` If the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> says he is entitled to asylum, he is safe. The Latin Americans are especially strong on diplomatic asylum.'' <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s claims to asylum are invalid because he does n't fit into the categories for which asylum is granted: persecution on the grounds of religious or political beliefs. `` His fears are of prosecution in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on two indictments.'' he said. Meantime, <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION>, who spent Christmas day in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, indicated some of the 26,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in the country could be brought back sooner than expected because the situation is returning to normal. He gave no timetable. Despite occasional sniping incidents, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said the `` overwhelming sense is a return to normalcy.'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said the `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military did its job'' and now `` the lawyers and the diplomats have to take over.''

 The best time of year to catch a glimpse of migrating whales' slashing flukes and blowhole fountains begins this week in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> with the arrival of the first of 20,000 Pacific gray whales. Whale-watching boat operators are gearing up for the peak season that lures tourists and locals eager for a look at the whales that swim 6,000 miles south for the winter. `` Many -LRB- whales -RRB- go out of their way to meet the boats to be petted and touched,'' said <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cetacean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pedro </LOCATION>. `` They are curious about humans.'' The whales' migration path from the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> to warmer waters skirts the <LOCATION> Aleutian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> past <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to shallow lagoons off <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> peninsula The first whales, called front runners, are the expectant females who arrive in <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> in late December, soon thereafter giving birth and beginning to rear their young. Other adults and yearlings follow during a migration season that runs through April. The whales, formerly called the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> gray whales, were listed as endangered animals in 1969 when their numbers were down to about 3,000. But steps by the Mexican government to protect their breeding grounds and other conservation efforts helped boost the gray whale population.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s new president today defended the swiftness of <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s trial and execution and said there had been indications forces loyal to the ousted dictator might try to free him. Pro-Ceausescu security police today attacked <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> television headquarters, where the provisional government was based, but were driven off by army units supporting the revolution. `` After a gunbattle of a half an hour, the army regained firm control of the situation,'' <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported from the scene. <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> said the army was in control of most of the capital but that there were fears the security police would strike again. Overall, however, things appeared to be quiet, and businesses and factories began resuming operations after the 12-day-long revolt that ousted <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> after 24 years of strict Communist rule. The governing <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> demanded that security police surrender by Thursday and indicated they face the same fate as <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Elena </PERSON>, if they do not. The government set up military courts Tuesday to try members of <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s vicious security police. <PERSON> Ion </PERSON> <PERSON> Iliescu </PERSON>, named president by the governing <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, today defended the secrecy surrounding the <ORGANIZATION> Ceausescus </ORGANIZATION>' trial and execution on Christmas Day `` We are people carried away by a very spontaneous process. So there was a general demand which pushed us to follow this process,'' he told French television. He said the security police could have tried to rescue <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s Agerpres news agency said Tuesday night that <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s interim leaders set up special military courts to try `` all cases of terrorist acts'' and said sentences would be carried out `` immediately. It said the interim government demanded all members of the security police surrender by Thursday afternoon or they will be `` tried and condemned.'' Romanian television Tuesday night showed the first videotape footage of the trial of <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> and his wife. `` Everything that was said here is false, and I do n't want to talk anymore,'' <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> told his accusers, insisting he was still in power and refusing to acknowledge either the severe hardships he forced on his people or the massacre of thousands of people by his security forces. Earlier in the day, state television showed pictures of the bullet-riddled bodies of Nicolae and <PERSON> Elena </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, who was second-in-command in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, unrepentant right up until his execution, did not tolerate even the mildest dissent in 24 years of rule, and many Romanians are concerned that the bloody 12-day-old revolution that toppled him will not lead to democracy. <PERSON> Iliescu </PERSON>, in a speech Tuesday night, stressed that the 37-member <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> intends to govern only until `` new structures'' can be established under a new constitution. The leadership promised free elections in April, which would be the first in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> since 1937. The committee, comprised of dissidents, disaffected government officials and army commanders, has run the short and bloody revolution since taking over television headquarters Friday. Sporadic gunfire still rang out through parts of the capital after proof of the execution was broadcast, but <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> radio and Romanian sources said <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> loyalists were surrendering by the hundreds. Many buildings in <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> were burned out or pocked by the thousands of bullets and shells fired in earlier battles between the army _ which sided with the people _ and security forces sniping from windows and rooftops. The provisional government appointed its leaders on Tuesday and said it was repealing many hated laws that held Romanians in a straitjacket of repression, including one that required the registration of all typewriters. Some members of newly founded political parties demanded that all Communists be excluded from the government. The committee said <PERSON> Iliescu </PERSON>, 59, a senior Communist official until his demotion by <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, would remain chairman as well as president. <PERSON> Petre </PERSON> <PERSON> Roman </PERSON>, a 43-year-old professor of hydroengineering with no political background, was named prime minister. In one of the government's first acts, <PERSON> Iliescu </PERSON> and Defense Minister Gen. <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Militaru </PERSON> ordered the dreaded state <ORGANIZATION> security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION> placed under the jurisdiction of the defense agency, leaving only traffic police, firefighters and prison guards under the jurisdiction of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. Other decrees repealed laws forbidding unauthorized contact with foreigners and requiring the intelligentsia to live in the same city where they work _ a statute frequently used to banish critical voices to remote towns. `` What we have achieved so far is to solve only emergency problems,'' Prime Minister Roman told the Soviet television news program `` Vremya.'' `` The questions I'll be dealing with are connected with restoration of the economy under new conditions.'' In a late night television address reported by <PERSON> Agerpres </PERSON>, <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> said his new government would be formed `` quite soon.'' `` We are not in a desparate situation,'' he was quoted as saying. But he noted that `` the <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> clique'' left the economy a `` disaster.'' `` The economy and social organization were ... at -LRB- the -RRB- beck and call of two primitive minds, with no perspective, but with the thirst for power,'' Roman said of the Ceausescus. At his trial, the 71-year-old <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> lashed out at his accusers as the charges were read against him and refused to reply when asked who ordered that demonstrators be shot on Dec. 17 in the western city of <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION>, where the revolt began. `` This was a coup d'etat, and I do n't answer your questions,'' he said. The Ceausescus were convicted of killing more than 60,000 people during their years in power, stashing more than $ 1 billion in foreign banks and ruining the national heritage and economy. <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s standard of living has plunged in recent years because of <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s harsh campaign to pay off the foreign debt, which included exporting the vast bulk of the nation's crops. A military officer who asked not to be identified said 300 soldiers volunteered for the firing squad to kill the former ruling couple but only three were chosen. The Ceausescus' were granted their last wish, to die together, the officer said. `` Down with tyranny!'' a radio announcer proclaimed after the executions. `` <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> is free ... the supreme moment has come.'' For some, death was not enough. `` He should be stripped naked, and his body paraded through the streets,'' said <PERSON> Dimitru </PERSON> <PERSON> Minca </PERSON>, 70, whose 14-year-old grandson was among those killed in the unrest. The Ceausescus were reportedly captured in an underground bunker after fleeing the capital in a helicopter. Their son and daughter, <PERSON> Nicu </PERSON> and <PERSON> Zoia </PERSON>, and other family members were arrested and reportedly face trial.

 Dec. 21 <ORGANIZATION> Warren </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> -RRB- Tribune-Chronicle on the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> invasion: We can find plenty of reasons for wishing President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had not invaded <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> Wednesday to oust dictator <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Furthermore, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> pulled the trigger on what, at first glance, looks like flimsy pretexts. <PERSON> Noreiga </PERSON> did virtually declare war with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> Friday, and his actions in the next few days were troubling. But, while we do not mean to belittle anyone's life, only one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen was killed before the invasion. ... And while Wednesday's well-orchestrated events began with the swearing-in of a democratic government, our invasion made it our government, in a sense our puppet. And yet, deep inside, we have a gut feeling that justice just might have been served. ... We should be humble and perhaps even a little ashamed we had to resort to violence. But <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> by all accounts did deserve to be ousted and should be brought to trial. In that light, perhaps a more apt comparison than the invasion of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> may be the killing in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. Would we protest if Soviet President <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> invaded <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> to put a stop to the killing there?

 Dec. 24 The Greenwood -LRB- Miss. -RRB- Commonwealth on the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> invasion: President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision to invade <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, we're certain, will be well received by the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people. His popularity rating will shoot upward. This is the president who has been criticized for being too cautious and too prudent _ a wimp, some have called him. Now he's playing Rambo Few nations are applauding. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> might does not necessarily mean right, despite the fact that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was a disreputable dictator who pushed his luck too far and who should have been dumped. But many Americans do not properly appreciate the sensitivity of the Latin Americans to intervention by Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>. The Latins have a name for it _ gunboat diplomacy. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has no legal or moral right to intervene in the affairs of independent nations. ... In this case, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> made it easy for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. In retrospect, we wonder why our government made it so hard for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to step down peaceably. Why did we insist that he be tried on drug charges? ... We should have eased him out, cajoled and persuaded him to resign, then slipped him away to exile.

 Dec. 25 The <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION> -RRB- News on the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> invasion: <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> may have lost a tinhorn dictator last week, but in the near future it will gain about $ 375 million in assets and multi-millions more in back taxes from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies. Looks like a pretty good swap from here. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> cut off all military and economic aid to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in July 1987 in an attempt to force <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> from power. Further sanctions sharply restricted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies that do business in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, froze Panamanian assets held in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, held payments relating to operating the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> in escrow and forbade American companies from paying taxes and fees to the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> regime. But those sanctions probably hurt the poor people of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> more than <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>.

By demanding that the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> shove him out the door into the hands of what is, in fact, an invading army we would raise again all the anger, latent, at best, in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, over the colossus of the North.

 Dec. 22 The <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION> -RRB- Chronicle on nuclear plant safety: Officials at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear weapons plants say the knowing disregard for worker safety that prevailed 30 to 40 years ago would not occur today. Americans in general, and weapons plant workers in particular, can hope that's true. They may never feel completely confident it's true, though, given the evidence that weapons-production pressures have taken precedence over worker safety for virtually the entire history of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear weapons production ... <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is in the process of providing funds for a new generation of nuclear weapons plants. So dramatic are the trends in superpower relations that even the most prudent observers rightly can ask how much production capacity is required. Some such capacity, however, will be required _ if only to recycle old warheads to glean the materials for a much smaller deterrent force. Given that need for a new generation of weapons plants, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> must see to it that those new plants are operated safely. The means to that end, not yet achieved, is a management structure severing safety obligations from production responsibilities and making the latter subordinate to the former.

 Dec. 19 The Cedar Rapids, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, Gazette on <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> pollution: Abuse and indifference finally have caught up with the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. It probably should n't have come as too great a shock recently when the environmental group <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> pronounced `` the father of waters'' a `` soup of toxic chemicals.'' ... <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s contribution to the pollution is varied, although the greatest portion comes from agricultural pesticide runoff. Startling quantities are involved: It has been determined, for example, that 112,000 pounds of the chemical Alachlor flows past a test site in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> each year. The <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> report pointed a finger at specific industries, as well, claiming they are discharging `` metals, solvents, cancer-causing hydrocarbons,'' and assorted other toxins into the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> at <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Muscatine </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Riverdale </LOCATION>. ... Any smugness we middle Americans may have felt toward our countrymen in the sooty, grimy reaches of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> with their debris-infested beaches is misplaced until we get to work cleaning up after ourselves.

At $ 9 million for three years, <PERSON> Puckett </PERSON> will average $ 250,000 a month. And he is n't even the highest paid player in major league baseball. Lately, baseball players have been grabbing the spotlight. They have been the beneficiaries of a spectacular, new boom in salaries. The players have shown that they can overpower team owners at the bargaining table, as well as on the field. The new salary structure is almost sickening. It reflects a skewed system of public values that has actually been in place for decades. Do n't blame the modern players for taking what they can get. That's how free enterprise works. If you like, blame the owners, who publicly plead poverty, and then get into multimillion-dollar bidding wars for mediocre pitchers and .225 hitters. Mostly, though, blame those of us who are silly enough to keep going to games, keep watching them on television, keep reading about them and otherwise keep caring.

From dusk Friday until noon on Christmas, the 23-member crew flushed toilets. Each person was responsible for an average of 21.8 toilets each. Everything went fine until a power outage shut down stadium water pumps on Saturday and Sunday. The stadium sustained about $ 5,000 damage to plumbing. `` When the pumps were n't working and the water pressure was bad, there was n't much you could do,'' said sports complex manager <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Fagan </PERSON>.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers played loud rock music, mowed the lawn and shot out street lights around the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> Embassy today after hours of curbside diplomacy failed to break a stalemate over the status of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> today there was no legal way the Holy See could hand over <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would not give up efforts to gain custody of the ousted dictator, who is wanted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug charges. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, asked authorities in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to freeze bank accounts in which <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is believed to have stashed millions of dollars in illegal drug profits. Before dawn, a company of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers paraded past the <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, where <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> sought refuge Christmas Eve, five days after American troops invaded <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in an effort to capture him. American troops mowed down a field of tall grass alongside the embassy overnight and shot out all working street lights with a pellet gun. Later in the morning, some soldiers hooked up small olive-green speakers in the parking lot of the nearby Holiday Inn and played <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowie </PERSON>'s `` Modern Love'' album and other rock music at high volume. The sound easily reached reporters in a 12th-floor room overlooking the <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. Army Lt. Col. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Murguia </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, said he could not comment on why the troops might have mowed the lawn and shot out street lights. The music appeared to relieve the tedium for some of the soldiers, who have had to stand in the hot sun for hours wearing heavy flak jackets. On Tuesday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers searched the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> representative, <PERSON> Monsignor </PERSON> <PERSON> Sebastian </PERSON> <PERSON> Laboa </PERSON>, and his car as he left the embassy, apparently to prevent <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> from being spirited out. After a week of fighting, order returned to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Crews cleared mounds of garbage left from wild looting sprees that emptied shelves, and many people returned to work. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military reported only scattered clashes with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> loyalists Tuesday. A few members of his <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> were arrested and many surrendered. On the third day of negotiations over <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s fate, Gen. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurman </PERSON>, who commands <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in Central and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, posted himself outside the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Embassy </LOCATION> for nearly six hours Tuesday afternoon. He met three times with <PERSON> Laboa </PERSON> in the street and spent the rest of the time waiting in a car, one of a caravan of sedans, jeeps and armored personnel carriers that escorted him to the mission. Neither Thurman nor other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials would comment on the negotiations. At the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> told reporters the Holy See could not legally give <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials because the embassy is empowered to deal only with the Panamanian government. He said <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s U.S.-backed civilian government had not made any request for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> also said the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> had not spoken with other countries about arranging exile for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> have no extradition treaty and the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> criticized the bloody <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion that toppled the general and installed the government of President <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, who was elected in May in balloting <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> nullified. Without an agreement, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> will not get past the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops surrounding the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> mission. Under international law, embassies are considered inviolable and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops can not legally enter the mission to get him. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops also surrounded the Cuban, Nicaraguan and <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> embassies, where it was thought <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> might try to seek refuge. In retaliation, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> announced today it will not permit a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plane carrying supplies to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> to land next month until the embassy standoff ends. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, speaking to reporters today in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, said he was personally involved in trying to win custody of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and had set no time limit on negotiations. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> probably went to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> mission on his own after his closest collaborators either deserted him or were arrested. Lt. Col. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Cid </PERSON>, considered one of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s right-hand men, pleaded innocent Tuesday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to drug smuggling charges. `` I surrendered myself _ I wanted to be brought here,'' he told the court. He is charged with racketeering, drug smuggling and money laundering in the same February 1988 indictment that names <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Cid </PERSON> was `` a liaison, courier and emissary for <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, dealing wit drug trafficking.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug agents in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> were scrutinizing thousands of documents seized in raids on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s houses and government offices, including the headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Narcotics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. The information included files on foreigners entering and leaving the country. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agent, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said some of the files were on Colombian drug lords. In <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops continued to block some major streets, adding to the usual traffic jams, and 15 tons of emergency medical supplies arrived to help hospitals in need of blood, surgical equipment and other basics. Since the invasion began, 23 Americans and 293 Panamanian military have been killed and 330 Americans and 123 Panamanians wounded, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>. Another 4,446 Panamanians have been detained. Panamanian doctors say more than 100 civilians were killed and hundreds of others injured. No complete figure was available because many civilians were buried quickly in common graves and there were no authorities to keep records.

They scheme to win over and bring under their control socialist countries, declaring that they would render economic ` aid' to somer country and treat some other country as ` most favored nation.''' They slander socialism in the media, seek to `` infiltrate the corrupt bourgeois ideology, culture and way of life into socialist countries,'' and send in spies and saboteurs, the paper said. `` The situation makes it incumbent upon all socialist countries and the anti-imperialist independent forces to heighten vigilance over the vicious and crafty anti-socialist moves and reactionary offensive of the imperialists and pool their strength to repulse them,'' it added.

 A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agency appealed Wednesday for 700,000 tons of food to avert widespread starvation in northern <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> where as many as 4 million people are threatened by famine. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> said its estimate was based on a recent crop survey which found that serious drought had cut harvests by nearly 80 percent in <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> and 50 percent in <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION>'s southern neighbor, <LOCATION> Tigre </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FAO </ORGANIZATION> said there also would be food deficits in eastern <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> and to a lesser extent in pockets of the southern and central regions. An `` international relief operation of major proportions'' is needed to avert a repeat of the 1984-85 drought and famine when an estimated 1 million people died, said <ORGANIZATION> FAO </ORGANIZATION> Director-General <PERSON> Edouard </PERSON> <PERSON> Saouma </PERSON>, in a statement issued in <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION>. The Ethiopian government has put the number of people threatened with hunger at 1.8 million and directed the country's own relief agencies to study ways to get relief food to them. The situation has deteriorated since the initial estimates in September by the Rome-based agency, <PERSON> Saouma </PERSON> said, and `` the population at risk is increasing at an alarming rate.'' He said current food stocks in the affected areas would be exhausted by early 1990. Only 270,000 tons of food had been pledged so far by international donors and appealed for 700,000 tons of emergency food mostly for the drought-affected northern regions and 400,000 tons of structural and project food aid, he said. <PERSON> Saouma </PERSON> also urged donors to provide logistic support to ensure the `` timely delivery'' of the emergency aid. <PERSON> Saouma </PERSON> did not specify the nature of logistic support but fighting in <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> and Tigre between the government and insurgents has closed many roads, a situation that might require aircraft for relief deliveries. Relief agencies and donors have so far unsucessfully appealed to the rebels and the government to agree on air and ground corridors through which supplies can move, unhindered by fighting. Another <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, the World Food Program, has appealed for 600,000 tons of food to feed as many as 4 million people threatened with famine.

<HEAD>Romania Seeking Swiss Help to Recover Any Ceausescu Assets</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Romania, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERN, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s provisional governmment will ask <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> for judicial assistance to try to recover any assets <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> may have stashed in Swiss banks before he was ousted and executed. Ambassador <PERSON> Gheorghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolgu </PERSON>, who declared his support for the anti-Ceausescu uprising last week, delivered a diplomatic note to the <ORGANIZATION> Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday announcing that a formal request would follow. The new leadership has two months to detail its request. In anticipation of the request, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> on Sunday froze an any assets linked to <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> or his clan, addressing itself in particular to two of its largest banks, <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suisse </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Switzerland </ORGANIZATION>. The action was taken after <PERSON> Moritz </PERSON> <PERSON> Leuenberger </PERSON>, a Social Democratic member of parliament and lawyer, said he received information from unidentified Romanian exile sources that <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> had transferred about $ 400 million, chiefly gold bullion, to <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, much of it in recent weeks and months. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joerg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kistler </PERSON> said a circular from the <ORGANIZATION> Romanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> dated Dec. 25 asked all countries to block any <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> accounts they may be spotted. According to a videotape of his secret trial released by the new leadership in <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> denied having assets in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and refused to sign a statement authorizing the return of any such assets to the Romanian <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. His wife, <PERSON> Elena </PERSON>, rejected the military court's question about Swiss funds as a provocation. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Gertrud </PERSON> <PERSON> Erismann </PERSON> said the freeze had been `` superfluous because no serious bank would permit in such a situation permit the withdrawal of funds by people who may have obtained them illegally.'' She declined comment when asked whether <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> had traced any funds. Confirming or denying their existence would violate Swiss banking secrecy laws, she added. A <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suisse </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Reinke </PERSON>, said a careful check had not produced any evidence of Ceausescu-linked assets at the bank.

 There's oil in them thar birds, and two entrepreneurs are cashing in on the animal that's so despised in its native land that the government once paid people to kill the varmints. On a 65-acre tract in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Piney </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Woods </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dusty </PERSON> <PERSON> Driskell </PERSON> are entering their second year as a new breed of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oilmen _ raising emus. `` It's just been unbelievable for us, beyond our wildest dreams,'' said <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>, 27, whose full-time job with the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> is designing furniture manufactured for the state by inmates. `` We have to pinch ourselves to see if we're awake. It's still hard to believe and we have to tell ourselves it's really happening,'' added <PERSON> Driskell </PERSON>, 29, a tax consultant. Last October, the lifelong friends purchased a pair of emus for $ 1,800. The Australian birds, which resemble ostriches, now fetch more than $ 12,000 per pair. They now have 31 birds, including 12 breeding pair. And profits from sales of birds to people who buy them as an investment have enabled <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Driskell </PERSON> to purchase the 65-acre spread in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. `` People do n't know what they are, but they've been good for us,'' <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> said. Emus can grow to about 5 -LCB- feet tall and can weigh up to 120 pounds. The only bigger bird is the ostrich. Emus have brownish-black feathers, long neck and long legs that can propel them about 30 mph. The bird's meat, leather and feathers are marketable, but what makes emus valuable is the oil they secrete. The oil _ about 5 quarts per processed bird _ is used as a pharmaceutical for people suffering from arthritis. In cosmetics, the oil is used in production of wrinkle-retarding emollient. <PERSON> Driskell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> say the meat, although not readily available, tastes like beef and has less cholesterol and fewer calories. The leather is used like ostrich leather and the feathers are used for fishing lures and feather dusters. Even the large toenails _ three per foot _ are used for jewelry. `` Right now it's strictly a breeders' market,'' <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> said recently. `` That's why prices are so high because there are not so many around. But it's getting more common.'' Emu prices are on the rise because of speculation about placing a processing plant in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, according to the American <ORGANIZATION> Emu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Harper </LOCATION>. One plant already operates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and another in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, where thousands were killed and bounties were placed on the emu because the bird trampled sheep fences and ate crops. The association estimates about 1,500 breeding pair were in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as of last year, with the largest concentration in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Driskell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> have driven as far as <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> to purchase birds. `` Whenever the processing stage comes into play we're going to get less per bird,'' <PERSON> Driskell </PERSON> said. `` But I'll be tickled to death when it happens because you'll be looking at a definite place to sell the bird and a definite income coming in.'' Their first breeding pair, named <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON>, laid 36 eggs the first year. The eggs, which are dark green and resemble avocados, hatch in 48 to 52 days. And once the birds get into a cycle, they'll lay eggs every three days. <PERSON> Driskell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> are expanding their farm and hope to eventually have 90 pens in operation. Some people will purchase chicks at $ 1,000 to $ 1,500 apiece, keep them for three or four months and then sell for as much as $ 3,000 each. Feed costs are minimal, ranging from $ 150 to $ 180 per year for each bird. Neighbors who raise cattle like to joke that <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> is a land for moo-moo, not emu. `` They are an ugly bird,'' <PERSON> Driskell </PERSON> acknowledged. `` But when they sell for $ 12,000, they look pretty good.''

 Now that he's been toppled and executed, <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> has few defenders, his rank secure among the century's most brutal and despised dictators But it was n't so long ago the Romanian president was the West's favorite Communist, showered with kind words and economic benefits for his role as a maverick in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> was especially friendly toward <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> for many years, seeing a people with cultural affinities as well as a country whose independence from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> could be a mirror-image for French refusal to follow <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign policy leads. In the aftermath of the Romanian revolution, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> is now seeing apologies and recriminations, as politicians and parties accuse each other of being slow to realize the scope of <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s abuses of power Elsewhere, the change of heart has taken a different form. Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> stripped <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> of his honorary knighthood `` as a mark of revulsion at the abuse of human rights in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>.'' King Olav V of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> took away his honorary Grand Cross of St. Olav Order and, by action of Queen <PERSON> Margrethe </PERSON> II of <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, the Romanian leader was no longer a Knight of the Elephant Order when he went before the firing squad. All three monarchs acted after <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> was driven from power Friday, wiping out honors that had been awarded about a decade earlier, when <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s reputation was at its height. The process occurring in the aftermath of <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s ouster is similar to those that followed the demise of other dictators this century, such as <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Idi </PERSON> <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jean-Bedel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bokassa </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. It was not until early this year that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> withdrew <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s valuable status as `` Most Favored Nation'' for trade purposes, on grounds of human rights violations. As recently as 1986, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials were defending <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s Most Favored Nation status, with <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON>, counselor of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, telling a hostile congressional committee that <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> had an `` overall reasonably good record'' on allowing people to leave the country. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s reputation for free-thinking was earned in foreign affairs. He condemned the Soviet invasion of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in 1979 and refused to join the 1968 invasion of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> that ended the `` Prague Spring'' liberalization movement. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> also stood apart from the other Communist countries when he maintained links with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> after the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> War, eventually serving as mediator between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the talks that led to their peace treaty. The gratitude won as the Jewish state's only ally in a hostile Communist bloc has survived, although <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> condemned massive killings by the secret police and pledged support for <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s new leadership. `` Speaking as Jews and Israelis we can not forget the general point, we can not remember our enemies and forget our friends,'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s former ambassador to <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Abba </PERSON> <PERSON> Geffen </PERSON>, said Wednesday on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. `` We must not enter into the anti-Ceausescu hysteria.'' <PERSON> Anti-Ceausescu </PERSON> sentiment was mostly to be found in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> back in 1969, when <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> chose <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> for the first visit by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president to a <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact country. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> delighted crowds by joining in a traditional Romanian peasant dance, with a Romanian girl dancing between them. Their joint statement talked of a `` spirit of cordiality, sincerity and mutual respect.'' Earlier in the 1960s, <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaulle </PERSON> blazed the trail of ties between the West and <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaulle </PERSON> was following a policy of independence vis-a-vis the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> was seeking an ally in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> was following a similar path in the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact,'' said <PERSON> Ewa </PERSON> <PERSON> Kulesza </PERSON>, an expert on <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. `` There was a kind of identification between <LOCATION> De </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gaulle </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. It was an illusion,'' she said in an interview. The illusion, based in part on cultural associations between <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, whose languages are similar, was long-lasting. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheysson </PERSON>, former <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> foreign minister who visited <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> in 1983, apologized for his role in an interview published Monday in the leftist daily newspaper Liberation. `` We should have been more clear in our denunciations of what we knew, of what we guessed about <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, so that perhaps we could have precipitated the movements that we see now,'' <PERSON> Cheysson </PERSON> was quoted as saying. Former President <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Giscard </PERSON> d'Estaing accused the current Socialist government of not doing enough to call attention to <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s misdeeds. Socialist leaders criticized <PERSON> Giscard </PERSON> d'Estaing for exchanging visits with <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> _ while <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> at least scrapped a planned visit to <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> in 1982, although he cited scheduling problems rather than human rights abuses. The trip was never rescheduled. Giscard d'Estaing replied, in an interview in the rightist newspaper <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Figaro </PERSON>, that he `` personally felt a strong antipathy'' for <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> after their 1980 encounter in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, and said the translator at their session could confirm it. The heaviest fire has focused on <PERSON> Georges </PERSON> <PERSON> Marchais </PERSON>, the hard-line <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader, who vacationed on <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s yacht in 1984. Dissidents in the party called this week on <PERSON> Marchais </PERSON> and the entire Politburo to resign because of their past support for <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>. The Politburo replied that <PERSON> Marchais </PERSON> had not seen <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> in five years, and had made many quiet appeals to the Romanian leader for respect of human rights.

<TEXT>
 British diplomats to <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> said they ran into the streets and shouted rebellious slogans during the revolt against <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, and some envoys even joined a crowd that stormed the television station. `` We were cheering with them and shouting ` Down with <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>.' We were Romanians to all intents and purposes,'' said army Lt. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, an assistant defense attache. Fifteen members of the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> and their families arrived at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> airport Tuesday night after leaving <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it had `` no problems'' with <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s actions in <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>. A spokesman, who was not identified in accordance with British practice, said: `` As he made clear, he joined the crowd in order to be able to report developments. If he had not shown some degree of enthusiasm the crowd might have asked who he was. There were concerns in the crowd about the activities of the security forces.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, 40, said he went into the streets with the embassy second secretary, <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Laffey </PERSON>, to observe the uprising. `` We worked as a team out on the streets for a considerable time. The most remembered part for me was when we joined in with the students to take the television station,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` We went along with them. We went along with the armored personnel carriers they had captured, bedecked with civilians, flags, flowers and Christmas trees. `` We drove to the television building, went through the building and through the forbidden zone and stormed the building with them.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said it was the diplomats' job to observe the situation and they were `` taken along with it all.'' `` We were swept away by the emotion of it all. It was very exciting and we felt part of the events unfolding on the streets,'' said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Laffey </PERSON>, 28. When asked if he felt his action violated his diplomatic role, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> replied: `` I do n't think we took part in it. We went along as fairly passive observers and I think that was our job. If we had n't cheered and shouted slogans there might have been queries as to who we were. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said on another occasion he and the defense attache had driven on an armored personnel carrier to the scene of an attack and went through so much blood in the streets they thought it was water. `` I think there was an orgy of killing,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said the British diplomats worked in four groups of pairs observing activities. `` I do n't think any of us had come away unscathed,'' he said. `` It will certainly be on my mind for the rest of my life. I feel tremendous affiliation with the Romanian people. `` They have changed from being a nation of people who walk down the streets with their heads down. Now they are happy, they read newspapers in the streets and have smiles on their faces.'' <PERSON> Veronica </PERSON> <PERSON> Atkinson </PERSON>, wife of British Ambassador <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Atkinson </PERSON>, who has remained in <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>, said she hid in the basement of the embassy residence when one of the security policemen fighting the army was on the premises. `` We were terrified. We feared for our lives. Had we made any noise we would probably have been killed,'' she said.

 Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s attempts in October to convince <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> to abandon Stalinism helped topple the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> leader, a former <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> aide was quoted as saying Wednesday <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> visited <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> on Oct. 7-8 for celebrations marking <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s 40th anniversary of statehood. His visit came as a fledgling pro-democracy movement was growing in strength. In an interview with the newspaper <PERSON> Junge </PERSON> <PERSON> Welt </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> speaker <PERSON> Horst </PERSON> <PERSON> Sindermann </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> tried to convince the Communist Party chief to pursue reform, and that <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> resisted. `` The realization that <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> must go was growing all the time. The last push came from <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s visit for the 40th anniversary,'' <PERSON> Sindermann </PERSON> was quoted as saying. <PERSON> Sindermann </PERSON>'s interview was the first insight into the power struggle that preceded <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>'s last days in office and the pivotal role played by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s visit. <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, a hard-liner who ruled <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for 18 years, was ousted Oct. 18 and replaced as party leader by <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON>. Growing pressure from the pro-democracy movement and dissent in party ranks forced <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> and the entire <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> party leadership to step down Dec. 3. A new Communist-led reformist coalition took its place and has agreed with the pro-democracy opposition to hold free elections on May 6, 1990. The 77-year-old <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> and 11 of his former aides _ including <LOCATION> Sindermann </LOCATION> _ have been expelled from the party <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> has been placed under house arrest and he and other leaders are accused of profiting financially from their positions of power. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s visit came during a mass exodus of East Germans to the West. The official celebrations of East German statehood were marked by anti-government demonstrations, which included clashes between activists and security police. <PERSON> Sindermann </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>'s closest aides in the ruling Politburo, said differences between <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> and other Politburo members had been growing for some time. Describing a meeting between <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and the Politburo during the Soviet leader's visit, <PERSON> Sindermann </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> urged the leaders to pursue perestroika, the Soviet leader's system of social and economic reforms. `` He told us we would have a much easier time with perestroika because we have a much higher level of economic development,'' <PERSON> Sindermann </PERSON> said. `` But <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> kept on pulling out a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> statistic that showed that we had a higher productivity than the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. And he used it to argue that we must stay true to the old course,'' <PERSON> Sindermann </PERSON> was quoted as saying. `` He told this to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, too. That gave the impulse. We came out of the meeting and we were united. Now is the end. `` The next day we went to the Politburo and -LRB- former premier <PERSON> Willi </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Stoph </PERSON> made the motion to remove <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>. And that's how it happened,'' <PERSON> Sindermann </PERSON> was quoted as saying. He said the Politburo voted unanimously to oust <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>. `` He was fighting against it.'' Meanwhile, talks between the Communist-led coalition government and the opposition resumed in controversy Wednesday when the chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Awakening </ORGANIZATION>, one of the new political parties, withdrew from the forum. <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnur </PERSON> denied newspaper allegations that he had abused his position to obtain a large apartment. But <PERSON> Schnur </PERSON> said he was withdrawing from the talks until the matter is clarified. The fourth session of the discussions on the future of the country ended Wednesday with opposition calls for more say in the day-to-day running of the country. Several opposition leaders called on Communist Premier <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> to attend all the sessions and to consult more with the participants over important government decisions. The talks involve 37 representatives from five established political parties, including the Communists, and 16 opposition groups. The forum is acting as a watchdog group on <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON>'s government until the elections. The official news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> published results of a survey carried out last week in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>, the cradle of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s pro-democracy movement, that gave <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON> a 66 percent approval rating, up from 58 percent a week earlier

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> today agreed to restore diplomatic relations after a 12-year rift, the two governments announced. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> broke ties with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in late 1977 when then-President <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> opened peace negotiations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. A summit between presidents <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> will take place early in January, the prime ministers of the two countries said in a joint statement released in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>. `` The governments of the <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> have agreed to resume full diplomatic relations, effective Wednesday, December 27, 1989,'' the statement in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> said. `` This comes to express the determination of the two peoples to consolidate brotherly relations in all fields,'' it said. The breakthrough occurred after a series of meetings this years between officials of the two Arab countries. Earlier today, <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Atef </PERSON> <PERSON> Sedki </PERSON> hinted during a visit to <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> that the two countries would resume relations. <PERSON> Sedki </PERSON>, the first such high-ranking Egyptian official to visit <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> since the rift began, received a warm welcome by his counterpart, <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Zoubi </PERSON>, when he arrived at <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> airport. After an official ceremony and a brief meeting in the VIP lounge at <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> airport, the two prime ministers drove to the Muhajereen Presidential Palace for a meeting with <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>, state-run <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> radio reported. The broadcast quoted <PERSON> Sedki </PERSON> as saying in an arrival statement that he was `` very pleased'' to visit <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and that he was carrying a message to <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> from <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>. He did not disclose the contents of the letter. `` <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s goal is to unify ranks with <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and consolidate cooperation between our two countries,'' <PERSON> Sedki </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Zoubi </PERSON> told reporters, `` We are looking forward to more cooperation and coordination for the benefit of the entire -LRB- Arab -RRB- nation.'' He said restoring ties `` will open a new page in the history of our common destiny. Developments witnessed by the Arab world require that <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> return to each other on the basis of their historical and fraternal bonds.'' Cairo-Damascus relations were severed in December 1977, one month after <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> to begin a peace process that led to the signing of the U.S.-sponsored Camp David peace treaty in March 1979. Sixteen other <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states severed relations with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> after the treaty. All except <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> had since restored ties with <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s ties with <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> have improved but have not been restored.

 Defiant students shouted out criticisms of <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> and his hand-picked successor Wednesday in a dialogue with a senior government official. The <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students, in a two-hour meeting with <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Yuan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mu </PERSON>, also sought <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s response to events in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> and hissed when <PERSON> Yuan </PERSON> stressed that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> wo n't veer from its socialist road Yuan's meeting with the students appeared timed to the overthrow of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s dictator <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, which has rekindled sparks of student activism smothered by the June crackdown on the student-led pro-democracy movement. At least three illegal posters have gone up at <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Qinghua </ORGANIZATION> universities in recent days commenting on <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s uprising, according to Chinese and Western sources One poster said, `` Learn from <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>.'' Another, one of two at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, described <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> as a `` lost dog'' who might try to flee to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, whose leaders had regarded him as a friend. All the posters were torn down swiftly by authorities. It was one of the first open acts of opposition to the government on the campus since it was in the forefront of the crushed student movement. A student who attended the meeting said about 300 students with tickets issued by official student associations were allowed to attend the meeting, and only university-approved student leaders could read questions submitted in advance. But one student shouted out a question asking why former party chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> was purged following the June turmoil and blamed for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s economic and political problems when it was his mentor, senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, who has decided policy in the past decade. Yuan did n't answer, and also did n't respond when a student asked why <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> had suddenly anointed new party chief <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zemin </PERSON> as the `` core'' of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s new leaders after allowing the ouster of two tried and experienced revolutionaries, <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> and former party General Secretary <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON>. Hu, whose death in April set off the pro-democracy movement, was also dismissed from office, in January 1987, after being blamed for failing to stop student rallies for democratic reform. The students asked the whereabouts of <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, who has not been seen in public since May, and were told he is in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. They also asked about <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> student who was one of the leaders of the spring movement. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> party Secretary General <PERSON> Yuan </PERSON> <PERSON> Liben </PERSON> said he was under arrest, but provided no other details. When asked about <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Yuan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mu </PERSON> replied: `` No matter what the situation is in the rest of the world, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will always walk the path of socialism, uphold the socialist flag and adhere to the leadership of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION>.'' The student participant said Yuan spoke with vehemence, standing up and banging his hand on the table. But when he went on to repeat familiar socialist principles, some students made hissing noises. `` The students were very brave to do that in these times,'' the student said. Some students also yelled out questions about the legitimacy of two student leaders who were reading questions. In May, when independent student organizations were formed to challenge the officially sanctioned student unions, students voted the two out of office. The independent unions have since been declared illegal and the sanctioned groups restored to their former place. The student said the session ended without all the questions being answered but that both sides appeared glad to terminate the largely fruitless dialogue. Since June, university students have been subjected to a campaign of heavy political indoctrination and have been forced to write `` confessions'' repenting their activities during the demonstrations. Students say another major uprising is unlikely at present because of the political repression and close surveillance, but that anger over the bloody military attack in June when hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of demonstrators were killed has not subsided. In addition to the poster at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, another poster was seen recently outside the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> urging students to remember June. At least six people were arrested Dec. 9 when students from the <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> unfurled a banner in front of the central TV station reading: `` Motherland, why are you so poor?''

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today that ousted <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> ruler <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s knowledge of <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> activities could not embarrass the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government but that he could try to `` blindside'' the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> judicial process. `` I think that's history, and I think the main thing is he should be tried and brought to justice,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said at a brief news conference as he arrived in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> for a six-day fishing and hunting vacation. He said a trial on drug-trafficking charges lodged against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in this country could result in `` some release of certain confidential documents that he may try to blindside the whole justice process.'' But, he added, `` The system works, so I would n't worry about that. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked if he would direct release of any documents <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> might request in order to avoid challenges to the fairness of the trial as occurred in the case of Iran-Contra defendant <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>. He replied, `` There'd be enough to see that he's given a totally fair trial, certainly ...'' Later, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appeared to leave open the possibility that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> could be tried in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> He said there was a threat of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> regaining power if he remained there `` unless he were in total custody and sentenced to the prison sentence he deserves.'' The president said he was personally involved in efforts to gain custody of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> from the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> embassy in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has been sheltered since Christmas Eve, but he had not contacted either the papal nuncio in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> or Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> II. Earlier, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters aboard <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> One en route to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> `` can talk about the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> until he's blue in the face. It wo n't hurt anything.'' He was referring to things <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> might reveal about his previous close relations with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, including the period in the 1970s when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director and <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was an intelligence source. `` We want <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> here because he would cause trouble wherever he goes ... We want him in a nice jail cell where we can keep an eye on him,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. He said it would `` require a lot of diplomatic effort and a lot of it on my part'' to address the concerns of Latin American leaders who have been critical of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military action in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. But he said that as they see democracy functioning in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> brought to justice, they would `` begin to see the problem that might have been caused by a prolonged conflict down there ...'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, taking questions yelled above the roar of helicopter rotors at a naval air station, said there would be `` no time limit'' on negotiations over <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The president was asked about the reported refusal of the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> to surrender <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who has taken shelter in its <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> embassy, to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities. `` That complicates things if they said that,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that, however, he wanted more specific information on the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s position and would not give up hopes of winning <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s extradition. `` We will continue to negotiate,'' he said. The president defended his decision to take the year-end vacation in view of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> situation, claiming he did not think it amounted to shirking his responsibility as chief executive during a time of crisis. `` I'm not concerned about that at all. Why should I be?'' he said. `` Things have gone well. It's winding down.'' The president said that he would stay in constant touch with his national security advisers in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> by telephone, `` by secure link,'' and he noted that Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> had come along with him for part of the vacation. `` Look, I do n't make any cover. I'm going to be enjoying myself and I think the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people understand that,'' he said. `` I think I've worked pretty hard all year.'' On another subject, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he hoped that stability could soon be restored to <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> and said that the provisional government and the army appeared to be doing a good job of restoring order. `` My concern is for tranquillity and freedom in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. The president said that he was `` touched'' by hearing a `` guy singing a Christmas carol'' on <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s state-run television. Claiming it was the first time that a Christmas carol had been heard on the public airwaves in 40 years, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` It made a dramatic statement for me.'' `` Democracy and freedom is on the move around the world,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who wore a hunting jacket and the pinstriped pants of his suit as he spoke briefly with reporters aboard the plane, said he spent much of his Christmas holiday at Camp David, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, on the phone but `` got a great Christmas present'' in <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s overthrow by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops on Dec. 19. The president and his wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, were at Camp David with their five children and their families, including 11 grandchildren. Describing his holiday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` It was cold, wonderful _ sleigh riding for the kids. It was great.'' Earlier, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will keep close tabs on developments in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> by telephone. He said Tuesday the administration told the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> `` very directly'' it wants <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> returned for trial. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was not taking a direct role in the negotiations on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s extradition. After fishing in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> later today near <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was to travel by helicopter some 60 miles to the ranch of a friend near <LOCATION> Beeville </LOCATION>, where he will spend two days quail hunting. He goes to <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> on Friday, where he will stay until Monday. On Sunday, he plans a side trip to two military hospitals near <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> to visit <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers wounded in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Ceausescu's Fall Began With Action Against Clergyman</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MORT ROSENBLUM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> made the first of his final mistakes when he tried to deport the Rev. <PERSON> Laszlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Toekes </PERSON>, a popular pastor of Hungarian heritage who spoke his mind from the pulpit in <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s durable dictator did not like Hungarians, and a rambunctious community of ethnic <PERSON> Hungarians </PERSON> challenged his control. <PERSON> Toekes </PERSON>, articulate and courageous, amounted to a dissident. On Friday, Dec. 15, youths in the city about 300 miles west of <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> formed a human chain to shield him from police and prevent his arrest. They were dispersed with tear gas and water cannons, but even larger crowds gathered at the cathedral the next day. Crowds again formed on Sunday _ more raucous and threatening _ but still peaceable. Local officials, fearing wrath from the <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> if things got out of hand, ordered heavy repression. Security forces drove assault vehicles into the crowd, and they opened fire. Innocent protesters died in their friends' arms. So did children. No one knew the death toll, but word began to spread around the world. Then <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> made another mistake. He ignored the explosive situation and left on a three-day trip to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Authorities had to use their own judgment, with only the dictator's iron-willed wife, <PERSON> Elena </PERSON>, to guide them. Because the world had gotten word of what was happening in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, even other Romanians _ for a change _ were informed. Foreign radio broadcasts, including those from neighboring <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, echoed the news to <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>, the capital, and spurred protesters in <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION>. Despite the violent repression, demonstrators came back, and the guns fired again. Killings were mostly by the hated <ORGANIZATION> Securitate </ORGANIZATION>, a secret police and elite guard fiercely loyal to <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>. But the army helped subdue protesers. What should have been crowd control was a chilling example of the ruthless terror <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> had applied to keep his increasingly extravagant personal regime in place: a protest of one man's impending arrest was suddenly a release for years of pent-up hatred By Thursday, <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> was back in <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>, facing the worst crisis in 24 years of power. That's when he made another mistake. Yet again, <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> summoned his masses for a spontaneous outburst of their warmth and loyalty. At a huge rally, he harangued them with the old slogans. If students were unhappy, he would raise their allowances a little. Some subsidies would be increased. As for <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION>, he said, it was the work of `` hooligan elements,'' and `` external meddlers.'' Most of the crowd had to be there, and their future in <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s society depended upon how earnestly they cheered. But one group of young people, mostly students, had heard those Stalinist formulas once too often. They whistled and booed <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> to silence, demanding an explanation for the events in <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION>. The live TV and radio broadcast was cut for several minutes to spare the dictator further embarrassment. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s face showed disbelief as he plowed on. But he had lost the crowd. Obedient applause was drowned out by cries of `` Death! Death!'' and `` Down with <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>!'' When the shaken dictator finished, students staged their own rally. They snaked through <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> streets, picking up in number and staying slightly ahead of the water cannons. At nightfall, thousands had assembled around University Square. Sometime during the night, the secret police went for blood. Light tanks crashed into the crowd. Marksmen atop buildings shot people in the back. Covered trucks carried the bodies to secret graves. But the students came back the next morning, on Friday. Army tanks rolled up to face them. But they did not fire. Instead, students stuck Christmas tree branches down their rifle barrels, and soldiers smiled shyly, in sympathy with the crowd. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s media pressed on in his service. At 11 a.m., the television announced that Defense Minister <PERSON> Vasile </PERSON> <PERSON> Milea </PERSON> committed suicide because he was found to be a traitor. Quickly, word spread that he was shot for not ordering repressive fire. A small delegation walked to the Communists' Central Committee building and persuaded the army to join the people. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> finally got the message. He and his wife took a helicopter to a government airbase 30 miles north but could not arrange a safe haven in another country. They headed north in a small car, humbled and on the run, until they were captured. For days afterward, secret police diehards fought urban guerrilla warfare to take back the capital. The Central Committee building and the elegant palace nearby was bombed out and burned. Many thousands of Romanians had to be buried. <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> and <PERSON> Elena </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> were tried by a secret military tribunal. He animatedly argued that the charges against him were lies, that he ordered no killings, that he and his wife lived as ordinary Romanians. But he made no apparent admission of the mistakes he made. He and his wife were convicted of grave crimes against <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, put up against a concrete wall and executed by three riflemen chosen from among hundreds who volunteered.

<HEAD>East German Company to Sell Parts of Berlin Wall</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 An East German company is taking over sale of pieces of the crumbling <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall, with the proceeds to be donated to humanitarian causes in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. `` <ORGANIZATION> Limex-Bau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Export-Import </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is taking over the sale of available original parts of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall,'' <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Profits will be used solely for humanitarian purposes, such as health facilities,'' <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said, quoting the state-owned company's manager, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Pfannschmidt </PERSON> East German border troops will help secure parts of the wall made available for sale, <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said. Up to now, sale of parts of the wall had been left up to companies outside <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the report said. It did not identify the firms. Since the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall was opened Nov. 9, hundreds of souvenir hunters have flocked to the western side of the barrier daily to chisel away pieces. Ambitious hawkers have been selling small chunks of the wall to tourists in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> for prices ranging from $ 2.95 to $ 29. In most cases, authorities have not interfered with the wall chiselers, but last week <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> police detained two Americans and a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> man who had loaded five 3-foot-by-8-foot sections of the wall onto a truck. The men, who were not identified, were released.

 The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> on Wednesday said it had not yet reached a decision about Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, but it declared it would not simply push him out of its embassy in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and hand him to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> have been reported to be contenders for accepting the ousted <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> leader, but <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> said that so far the Holy See had not contacted any third country. `` It's too soon,'' <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> told a news briefing. He added that `` as of this moment,'' the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> has not yet made a decision about <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s bid for asylum status. <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> was pressed repeatedly about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration assertions that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> officials forcefully demanded <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> be turned over to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities so he can be tried on drug trafficking charges. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has put its case very clearly and with respect and very cordially,'' <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> also presented its case `` with the same clarity,'' <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> said. `` Taking into account international law and accepted procedure, I do n't see how the embassy can hand over someone'' to a nation other than the host country, he said. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> spokesman declined to comment on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> criminal accusations against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. But he said, `` he has also been head of government and of the armed forces. There's something more than a criminal case here.'' On Wednesday, a Spanish newspaper published an interview with <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, who was installed as president after the invasion. <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, whose election in May was voided when <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> seized the ballots, was quoted as saying that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> should stand trial and added: `` <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> can not permit him to leave the country.'' <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> said there had been no request by <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as of Wednesday morning. Despite his estimate that the dilemma could be resolved `` in a few days, not weeks,'' <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> offered no evidence that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> were close to a solution. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has been staying at the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> embassy in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> since Sunday. `` He is not allowed to make telephone calls, not allowed visits,'' <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> said. `` He is simply staying'' at the embassy while his case is debated. <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> said the general, a captain and his wife, and another Panamanian military officer were allowed to stay after <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> made `` a very serious commitment to help in easing the situation, the bloodshed'' in the wake of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion. <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> said it was the papal nuncio, or envoy, who `` autonomously'' decided to give <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> shelter. While Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> is not actively involved in the talks he has been kept informed of the situation, <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to the Holy See, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Melady </PERSON>, met Wednesday with Monsignor <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> <PERSON> Sodano </PERSON>, a senior <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> diplomatic official with expertise in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> affairs, <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> expressed hope the case would be resolved to the satisfaction of both the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> and `` in accordance with the international right -LRB- law -RRB- and justice.'' The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> is studying the case in its `` juridical, diplomatic and humanitarian, and therefore, ethical considerations,'' <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> said. Seeking to dispel the reports of tense U.S-Vatican relations, <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side had sent a message of appreciation for <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials' availability during the Christmas religious festivities. <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> stressed that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s action is seen as part of an `` accepted practice'' in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> countries of seeking asylum in embassies. As for cases involving the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>, `` no one has ever been expelled'' from an embassy after seeking asylum, <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> said. He pointed out that just two months ago, the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> mission in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> sheltered <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> after he was beaten by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> supporters. The late Cardinal <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Mindszenty </PERSON> took refuge in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mission in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> after Soviet forces crushed the 1956 Hungarian uprising. He had been freed earlier from prison by Hungarian revolutionaries. He had been convicted of treason in 1949 in what was considered a rigged trial. <PERSON> Mindszenty </PERSON> left at the embassy in 1971 under an agreement with the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>.

 A twin-engine commuter plane crashed and burst into flames after trying to land at an airport, killing the six people aboard, authorities said. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> plane went down 100 feet short of a runway at the <LOCATION> Tri-Cities </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Duff </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. Visibility was seven miles and winds were calm when the Jetstream turbo prop went down at 10:30 p.m. Tuesday, <PERSON> Duff </PERSON> said. The plane apparently split in half on impact and fire broke out in the forward section about one minute later, <PERSON> Duff </PERSON> said. One of the first to reach the scene was firefighter <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Bickle </PERSON>, who said he `` did n't know how anybody could have survived. It was a ball of flame.'' The year-old aircraft had a two-man crew, Capt. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> `` Will'' <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, 38, and First Officer <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> McInroe </PERSON>, 25, both of <PERSON> Kennewick </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Belmondo </PERSON>, president of the airline. <PERSON> Belmondo </PERSON> said the passengers included <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Shewmaker </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Richland </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> pilot; <PERSON> Rey </PERSON> <PERSON> Resendez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Duncanville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kingry </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kingry </PERSON>'s first name was not available and the identity of the sixth victim was being withheld pending notification of relatives. All passengers were male, <PERSON> Belmondo </PERSON> said, correcting a report that a woman was on board. <PERSON> Belmondo </PERSON> estimated the plane crashed 500 to 700 feet short of the runway and said it plowed into a sagebrush field where it burst into flames. He said he could not speculate on the cause of the crash. <PERSON> Belmondo </PERSON> said there had been no reports of problems during the flight from <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> to Pasco via <LOCATION> Yakima </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> is one of five commuter airlines of the same name around the country operating under a marketing agreement with <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. It uses the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> logo and acts as a feeder service to the larger airline. The commuter airline is based in this town 180 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. It serves <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and had a fleet of 25 planes. The Jetstream is built by British Aerospace and can hold 21 people, said <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lanfell </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> pilot.

<HEAD>Police Trying to Build Murder Case Against `Vampire Rapist'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MELBOURNE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A rapist who called himself a vampire and drank a victim's blood is suspected in at least six slayings, and prosecutors are trying to build a murder case against him before he gets out of prison. `` I do n't feel comfortable with him being in our community,'' State Attorney <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfinger </PERSON> said of `` vampire rapist'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Crutchley </PERSON>. `` The only crime we've proven him of is reason enough.'' <PERSON> Crutchley </PERSON>'s former lawyer, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, said he tried to work out a plea bargain in which <PERSON> Crutchley </PERSON> would have admitted to up to six murders and led investigators to the burial sites. But the talks broke down. <PERSON> Wolfinger </PERSON> said Tuesday the informal negotiations broke down because the state could not produce solid evidence linking <PERSON> Crutchley </PERSON> to any deaths. `` There comes a point in the negotiations when the state has to show something,'' the prosecutor said. `` If we had had anything to tie a charge to, we would have done it. But we had nothing.'' <PERSON> Crutchley </PERSON>, a former engineer, pleaded guilty in 1986 to raping a 19-year-old woman and was sentenced to 25 years in prison. Prosecutors agreed to drop several other charges, including robbing the woman of nearly half her blood. With time off for good behavior, <PERSON> Crutchley </PERSON> could be out of prison by 1992. Doctors saihey have long suspected him in the deaths of at least six women in <LOCATION> Brevard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> _ five victims whose bodies were discovered in 1985 and another woman who disappeared. But <PERSON> Wolfinger </PERSON> said his strategy was `` to get him in prison and continue the investigation of the homicides.'' `` We will continue to work these cases as hard as we can,'' he said.

<HEAD>Israel Extends Emergency Regulations in Occupied Territories</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Parliament on Wednesday extended for two years emergency regulations that allow the military to hold <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> prisoners from the occupied territories inside <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> territory. In the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, shops were closed by a general strike called by the Moslem fundamentalist movement <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION>, or Zeal. The strike was first ordered for Christmas but was delayed when Palestinian Christians objected. Israeli troops shot and wounded four Palestinians in clashes with stone-throwing youths in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, Arab hospital officials said. At least 640 Palestinians have been killed by Israelis in the 2-year-old uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation. Forty-three Israelis also have died, and 162 Palestinians have been slain by fellow Arabs on suspicion of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The latest death of a suspected collaborator occurred Wednesday, when <PERSON> Jawad </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Tmaizi </PERSON>, 40, died of wounds suffered in an attack by fellow Arabs the previous day. The 120-seat <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION>, or parliament, extended the Emergency Regulations of 1967 for two years at the request of the government. The vote was 29-9. The regulations permit the military to hold Palestinians arrested in the occupied lands in Israeli territory. They make <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> law applicable to Israelis in the territories but not to Palestinians, who are judged in military courts. `` This means there are different laws for Jews and Arabs. This bill perpetuates discrimination,'' <PERSON> Amnon </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubinstein </PERSON> of the liberal <ORGANIZATION> Shinui </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said during the <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION>'s brief debate on the issue. The army is holding about 9,000 Palestinians and has jailed more than 40,000 during the uprising. Many have been held in the <LOCATION> Ketziot </LOCATION> prison camp in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Negev </LOCATION> desert, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and human rights group have repeatedly complained that imprisonment there violates the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> human rights convention rule against moving prisoners out of occupied territory. Also Wednesday, about 1,300 American and <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> peace activists toured towns in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, but witnesses said the army blocked one bus of about 50 people from entering <LOCATION> Jericho </LOCATION>, while letting a second one through later. <PERSON> Marina </PERSON> <PERSON> Sereni </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the `` 1990: Time for Peace'' movement, said the army gave no reason for the action. The army spokesman's office said it had no information about the bus. Ms. <PERSON> Sereni </PERSON> said the group was appealing to authorities to reverse a ban on visits by the peace activists to Palestinian refugee camps. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Donini </PERSON>, an Italian delegate from <LOCATION> Torino </LOCATION>, also said the army intended to block Palestinians from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> from joining the group's `` peace chain'' demonstration Saturday. `` We are here to stress Palestinian rights, and this act is unjust,'' she told reporters. `` We are here to demonstrate together, Palestinians, Israelis and Europeans, and stress the importance of peace.'' Army officials have refused to comment on newspaper reports that Palestinians from the territories will be barred from taking part in the forming of a human chain around <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.

 Women will be earning more doctoral degrees than men by the year 2000, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> predicted Wednesday. In a projection of educational statistics for the remaining decade of the 20th century, the department also said elementary and secondary school enrollments will increase dramatically and teachers will be paid 14 percent more in real purchasing power. `` This publication will be a useful planning tool for our nation's governors, federal, state and local leaders and members of the business community,'' Education Secretary <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> said in a statement. Women have been earning more associate, bachelor's and master's degrees than men for the past several years, but 1999 is expected to be the first year that they exceed men in the number of doctoral degrees received Men will continue their dominance of first professional degrees in such fields as medicine and law, according to the study, entitled `` Projections of Education Statistics to 2000.'' Other highlights of the study include: _ Secondary and elementary school enrollment is expected to reach 49.5 million by the time classes begin in the fall of 2000, an increase of about 4 million students or 9 percent over the current school year Enrollment has declined 4 percent in the past 11 years. _ The biggest shift will be in the secondary schools, since the rise in enrollment reflects an increase in births that began in 1977 and has continued Secondary school enrollment peaked at 15.7 million in 1976, has since declined steadily and is expected to drop to 12.6 million students, its lowest since 1963, next year. It is expected to climb to 14.8 million, an increase of 18 percent, by the end of the century. _ The average public school teacher is expected to earn 14 percent more in real purchasing power, after adjusting for inflation, in the year 2000 than now The national average in the current school year is $ 31,200. _ The number of classroom teachers will increase by an estimated 15 percent, reaching 3.1 million by the year 2000 Most of the increase will be absorbed in secondary schools, which have lower student-teacher ratios and a greater range of subjects. _ The pupil-teacher ratio will continue to drop, although not as steeply as in the 1980s By 2000 the ratio for elementary and secondary schools, both public and private, is expected to be 16.1 students per teacher. In the current year it is 16.9. In 1978 it was 19.2. _ Expenditures per pupil for public elementary and secondary schools, now about $ 4,800, are expected to rise by 24 percent after adjusting for inflation _ College and university enrollments are expected to increase from 12.8 million to 13.4 million, a gain of 4 percent Faculty will also increase by 4 percent, from 741,000 in 1988 to 771,000 in 2000.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today he is `` amazed and respectful'' of the changes that have taken place in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> and that he hopes now for `` tranquility and freedom'' in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bloc </LOCATION> country. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters he was concerned that the trial of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s deposed dictator <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> was held in secret, `` but that's their matter,'' he `` I'm just amazed and respectful of the change that has taken place,'' he said as arrived here for six days of hunting and fishing. The task ahead for Romanians is `` to bring the remaining holdout forces to bay,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` The army seems to be doing that, and my concern is for tranquility and freedom in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>.'' The president sent a congratulatory message to <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s new head of state, President <PERSON> Ion </PERSON> <PERSON> Iliescu </PERSON>. `` The president expressed his sympathy over the tragic bloodshed over the past two weeks and his hope that <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> will now move along on a peaceful path of democratic change,'' the White House said in a statement issued in <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>. The administration was sending a C-141 cargo plane loaded with medical supplies to <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> on Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- AID -RRB- announced. The cost of the flight and supplies, about $ 250,000, was in addition to the $ 500,000 in cash the administration was giving to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> for medical supplies, along with $ 25,000 from an embassy contingency fund in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Dillen </PERSON> said that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, had requested an appointment with the provisional president, <PERSON> Ion </PERSON> <PERSON> Iliescu </PERSON>, but no appointment had been scheduled. Commenting on reports of an anti-Communist rally in the Romanian capital, <PERSON> Dillen </PERSON> said the embassy had reported the demonstration was attended by 500 to 1,000 students, and that a student leader had appeared on Romanian television. `` We encourage the government of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> to allow all voices to be heard as the process of reform and the transition to a new government progress,'' said <PERSON> Dillen </PERSON>, reading a prepared statement. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Natsios </PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> AID Office for Foreign Disaster Assistance, said that private citizens were welcome to help, but that `` the best way to get assistance to <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> is through cash donations.'' `` Concerned citizens are urged not to donate goods or supplies, which are sometimes inappropriate and tend to clog relief supply lines,'' <PERSON> Natsios </PERSON> said on Tuesday. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, who recognized the new government on Monday, expressed regret that Romanian revolutionaries did not hold an open trial for <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Elena </PERSON>, who were executed on Christmas day. `` We would have preferred it if there had been a public trial,'' <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials said they had been in contact with Romanian Ambassador <PERSON> Ion </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoichici </PERSON>, who announced over Christmas weekend that the embassy staff had switched allegiances to the new government. <PERSON> Stoichici </PERSON> kept the doors of the embassy closed Tuesday but said he was helping Romanians who wanted to return home. `` We have the same feelings as other Romanians,'' said <PERSON> Stoichici </PERSON>, who declared his loyalty to the new government on Saturday, before the outcome of the fighting was clear. Another embassy officer, <PERSON> Vasile </PERSON> <PERSON> Leca </PERSON>, said `` all the staff ... condemn the crimes that were done to the Romanian people by <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> and <PERSON> Elena </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Stoichici </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Leca </ORGANIZATION> refused to allow a reporter inside the embassy, speaking instead through iron bars on a window. Splattered, frozen eggs coated the white brick walls of the embassy, a turn-of-century mansion on <LOCATION> Sheridan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Circle </LOCATION> along Embassy Row. Wooden police barricades and yellow plastic tape stretched alongside the sidewalk where over the weekend scores of Romanians vented their rage against <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s 24-year rule. The ambassador said his first order of business was to `` work to improve relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' which had grown increasingly critical of <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s human rights policies. `` Las evening, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> informed us that they recognized the staff of the Romanian Embassy'' as representative of the new government, said <PERSON> Stoichici </PERSON>. He said he was in telephone contact with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities. A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said no meetings were scheduled between <LOCATION> Stoichici </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats. `` They are in telephone contact with us, but when we call them, they do n't answer,'' said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Press calls to the embassy were not answered, either. Romanian consular officials were accepting, through the barred window, visa applications from Romanian-Americans who wanted to return home.

<TEXT>
 State regulators, spurred by the collapse of <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION>, intend to prohibit the sale of high-risk junk bonds from the offices of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s state-chartered thrifts A temporary order will be issued next week by the state Savings and <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, Chief Deputy Commissioner <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. He said his agency will then begin procedures to make the order permanent. The order will affect about 117 state-chartered S & amp; L offices. Currently, no junk bond sales are taking place in any <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> thrift offices, although such practices have occurred in the past, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. `` Just so no one gets that idea in mind, we are saying you ca n't do it,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said Tuesday `` We just do n't think it is a good idea.'' An estimated 23,000 investors _ mostly retirees in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> _ claim they lost nearly $ 250 million when they purchased uninsured corporate bonds sold by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, primarily through the 26 offices of <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION>, its wholly owned subsidiary. The Irvine-based thrift was seized in April by federal regulators. The takeover is expected to cost $ 2.5 billion, the nation's largest thrift bailout. Many investors said that because the bonds were sold at savings and loan offices, they assumed they were insured against loss. The bonds, sold in 1987 and 1988, now are considered virtually worthless. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said similar rules on the sale of junk bonds are apparently being drafted by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thrift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervision </ORGANIZATION> and by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, a trade association for the industry. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thrift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervision </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday he did n't know of any such orders. The chairman of the federal <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON>, suggested earlier this year that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> consider a ban on junk bond sales from S & amp; L offices. New regulations passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> already require S & amp; Ls to get rid of their own junk-bond investments by 1994; those rules do n't apply to companies that are using <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L offices to sell junk bonds to the public. At <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION>, the actual approval to sell the bonds was given by the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporations </ORGANIZATION>, which is under fire for its role. With that approval, the state Savings and <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> gave <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> permission to lease space in each of its offices for employees of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> to sell the bonds. `` There was nothing illegal or illicit about what they were doing,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. But many of the senior citizens were not knowledgeable enough to realize the risk they were taking, he added.

<HEAD>20 Prisons Affected in Strikes for Amnesty, Better Conditions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Inmates demanding better living conditions and amnesties staged hunger strikes or other protests in at least 20 prisons across the country Wednesday. Opposition leaders, many of them former prisoners themselves, said they were working with the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> in reviewing inmate grievances and would propose an amnesty for some prisoners. Any amnesty would have to be granted by the president, who is to be elected Friday. <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, a leader in the opposition Civic Forum, is the only candidate. The prisoners' demands vary widely but focus on living conditions. <PERSON> Petr </PERSON> <PERSON> Pospichal </PERSON>, a Civic Forum spokesman, said many of the demands were legitimate. `` Many of us have experience in this situation personally,'' he said, referring to several members of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s reform government, including <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, who once were imprisoned for dissident activities. The non-violent protests began Friday when 2,500 inmates at Leopoldov Prison east of <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> began a hunger strike demanding a general amnesty. By Wednesday, the hunger strike had spread to 16 prisons in the <LOCATION> Czech </LOCATION> <LOCATION> republic </LOCATION> and four in the Slovak republic, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily Rude Pravo. Some prisoners waved banners advocating non-violence. `` The protest is spreading so fast it's impossible to monitor,'' said <PERSON> Pospichal </PERSON>. He said Civic Forum would ask that some sentences be reduced and some prisoners released. All political prisoners were released from Czechoslovak jails under an amnesty granted by hard-line Communist President <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Husak </PERSON> before he resigned Dec. 9. That amnesty covered 800 to 2,000 inmates. <PERSON> Popsichal </PERSON> said he did not know how many prisoners might be affected by a future amnesty but said six inmates sentenced in secret trials for espionage would be included on Civic Forum's list of those deserving amnesty. `` The president is the only one who can decide about whether to grant amnesty, and the scope is his decision,'' <PERSON> Pospichal </PERSON> said. The Czechoslovak government, meanwhile, announced plans for lavish inaugural festivities, including an outdoor ball, following <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s presidential vote Friday. <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, a playwright and former dissident, is the unchallenged candidate and would be <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s first non-Communist president in 41 years. The election is the crowning victory of a peaceful revolution that began Nov. 17 and ended four decades of Communist domination, ousted hard-line <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leaders, and installed a reformist government to plan for free elections next year.

 Suspicious packages prompted authorities to seal off the area around a county judge's home in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and to evacuate a federal building in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> today as a bomb scare in the Southeast widened. The package <LOCATION> Mecklenburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Constangy </PERSON> found on his porch this morning in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, contained only a doll, Assistant Police Chief D.R. <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said after authorities destroyed it. An X-ray had revealed some electrical and mechanical connections, presumably inside the doll, officials said. <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, police took a suspicious mailed package found by a <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> worker this morning to an unpopulated area. Officials said they would wait for a postal inspector to arrive from <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, before deciding whether to detonate it. `` It has n't been positively identified as an explosive device,'' <PERSON> Freddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, chief deputy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshal, said from <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>. The federal building in downtown <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> is located, was evacuated temporarily. The package had no return address and officials would n't disclose the addressee Officials were concerned because of recent mail or package bombs directed against judges or courts in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. Constangy, like other targets, had taken some controversial stands.

 The man who was driving the pickup truck in which former <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> manager <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> was killed was legally intoxicated at the time of the accident, a prosecutor said today.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Wednesday congratulated <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s new president, <PERSON> Ion </PERSON> <PERSON> Iliescu </PERSON>, and said he was `` amazed and respectful'' of the changes there. The White House said more humanitarian aid is on the way. `` My concern is for tranquility and freedom in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said at an airport news conference here as he began a six-day hunting and fishing vacation. At the same time, he declined to criticize harshly the quick executions of former dictator <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> and his wife. `` We did say that we were concerned that the trial of <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> should have been more open, but that's their matter,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He said he was `` just amazed and respectful of the change that has taken place'' in the final hardline <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc nation to undergo democratic upheaval. The president said he was especially `` touched'' at hearing about a Christmas carol being sung on the state-run television for the first time in 40 years. `` It made a dramatic statement to me,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the army appeared to be restoring stability in the violence-torn country. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also sent a congratulatory message to <PERSON> Iliescu </PERSON>. `` The president expressed his sympathy over the tragic bloodshed during the past two weeks and his hope that <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> will now move along on a peaceful path of democratic change,'' the vacation <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. In his message, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` expressed the hope that the new Romanian government will move quickly to implement democratic reforms based on the rule of law.'' `` He pledged <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support and assistance as <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> meets these challenges during the difficult transition ahead.'' The administration was sending a C-141 cargo plane loaded with medical supplies from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> on Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- AID -RRB- said. The cost of the flight and supplies, about $ 250,000, was in addition to the $ 500,000 in cash the administration was giving to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> for medical supplies and other humanitarian aid, and $ 25,000 from an embassy contingency fund in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. AID also said a team of experts from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was to arrive in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> Thursday `` to assess humanitarian needs to distribute the relief flight's cargo.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Dillen </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, had requested an appointment with the provisional president, <PERSON> Ion </PERSON> <PERSON> Iliescu </PERSON>, but no appointment had been scheduled. Commenting on reports of an anti-Communist rally in the Romanian capital, <PERSON> Dillen </PERSON> said the embassy had said the demonstration was attended by 500 to 1,000 students and that a student leader had appeared on Romanian television. `` We encourage the government of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> to allow all voices to be heard as the process of reform and the transition to a new government progresses,'' said <PERSON> Dillen </PERSON>, reading a prepared statement.

 Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> announced Wednesday he will proceed with plans to dismantle the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s organized crime strike forces despite some congressional claims the move is unwarranted.

Additionally, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said he would create an Organized Crime Council in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to oversee the federal goverment's attack on organized crime.

Moreover, organized crime is also operated by elements in the <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> community and gangs `` such as the Crips and Bloods and the Jamaican posses.'' In letters to members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> judiciary committees, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> also said his plan `` offers substantial managerial benefits that should not longer be postponed.''

<TEXT>
 Solidarity lawmakers proposed constitutional amendments Wednesday that include restoring the country's name to the prewar `` Republic of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>,'' from the Communist-imposed `` People's Republic of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>.'' Parliament convened Wednesday for a three-day session to consider sweeping economic legislation that was proposed earlier this month by the Solidarity-led government to transform the economy to a market system. The government hopes by the end of the session that parliament will pass wide-ranging laws that aim to reduce the current 900 percent inflation rate, make the zloty a convertible currency and reform the bloated state sector. In addition to the name change, the constitutional amendments would remove 19 articles, including one saying the Polish People's Republic is a socialist state and another that mandates the leading role of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in state affairs The prewar Republic of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> was changed to the People's Republic of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in July 1944 when Soviet-backed Polish communists entered the country and proclaimed a Communist government in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> The package also calls for dropping the phrase that says the `` Polish People's Republic will strengthen friendship with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and other socialist countries'' as well as removing a clause which refers to the socialist system in the Polish economy. The amendments were presented first to the Solidarity deputies by caucus leader <PERSON> Bronislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON> who appealed to the union-backed deputies to be present for the debate in parliament. <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON> said an amended Constitution would serve as a temporary one until a new Constitution could be drafted. The amendments must receive a two-thirds majority of the <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION>, as the lower house of parliament is called, to pass. The amendments also would create a provision for the formation of new political parties. As it is now worded, the Constitution allows only the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Peasants </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to operate legally. After the Solidarity-led opposition and Communist authorities agreed to partially free elections at talks this spring, union-backed candidates to parliament were forced to organize themselves as a club rather than a political party because of the wording in the Constitution.

 Like thousands of Houstonians, <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> spent the Christmas holidays bedeviled by problems caused by the record cold.

Two hours later, the family went shopping to keep warm at a mall. `` We were there about an hour and all their lights went off,'' Ms. <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> said.

When the family returned to Ms. <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>' mother's house on Christmas Day, there was electricity but no water.

 The cold snap may have had at least one beneficial effect by putting the chill on next summer's bug population. The record cold last week and over the weekend may have killed off large quantities of fleas, ticks, gnats, mosquitoes and flies, said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Funderburk </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Bibb </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> extension agent. `` It's hard to say what nature is going to do, but the insects that bother man should be less in number early in the summer,'' he said. The bug population could be back by late summer, <PERSON> Funderburk </PERSON> said. And household pests, such as cockroaches, probably wo n't be affected by the cold, he said. The cold also may have slowed the spread of a virus that damages peanuts, tomatoes and peppers, <LOCATION> Sumter </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Extension Agent <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> said. The virus is carried by aphids and thrips, insects susceptible to low temperatures, he said. <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s peaches may have gotten a boost from the cold. Peach grower <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickey </PERSON> of <PERSON> Musella </PERSON> said the cold was a good down payment on the 850 hours of `` chilling'' temperatures the trees need. `` It could n't be anything but beneficial to us peach growers,'' he said. `` Last winter we did n't get the adequate chilling required and that was one reason our peach crop came up real short.''

 The government's <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Facility </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that snow cover helped protect winter wheat from the severe cold over much of the central and northern <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> and the Corn Belt. `` Cold temperatures and lack of moisture stressed winter wheat in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>,'' the report said. `` The extent of the freeze damage was still unknown.'' The report covered the week of Dec. 18-24 and noted that `` a brutal blast of arctic air'' tumbled temperatures to record lows in many areas. Below-normal readings in major citrus and vegetable areas of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> cause widespread damage, although losses have not been fully determined, the report said. The facility is operated jointly by the department's of Agriculture and Commerce. Weekly reports cover general crop conditions but do not include production forecasts.

 On the 100th anniversary of the Eiffel Tower, mock charges calculated to wound French pride claim the Parisian landmark was copied from an ordinary light tower in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>. The claim, a just-for-fun charge filed with <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Jose </PERSON>'s mock <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inquiry </ORGANIZATION>, was brought against the estate of <PERSON> Alexandre </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustave </PERSON> <PERSON> Eiffel </PERSON> and demanded all profits the French have received since the 984-foot iron framework structure opened to sightseers at the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Exposition of 1889. The `` trial'' was set for Jan. 25. The complaint says Eiffel got his idea for the tower after being stricken dumb with admiration upon gazing at a now-defunct, 208-foot light tower at a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> intersection in 1881. The claim does not say what business Eiffel, an engineer, had in the orchard capital of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The claim will be prosecuted by <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernal </PERSON>, who admitted his case was built on hearsay and not a hint of direct evidence. `` It was rumored at the time the light tower was built that <PERSON> Gustave </PERSON> <PERSON> Eiffel </PERSON> came to see it. ... We are going to substantiate that rumor,'' <PERSON> Bernal </PERSON> heatedly told reporters. Lawyer <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Dulin </PERSON> pledged to defend the French origin of the tower, describing the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> version as puny. `` We,'' he fumed, `` gave -LRB- the Americans -RRB- the Statue of Liberty. We did not give them the liberty to steal any of the other monuments of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>.''

 A top official declared Wednesday that <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> is no longer a Communist country, and revolutionary leaders tried to stop citizens from waging a `` witch hunt'' of revenge against supporters of the old regime. Security police still loyal to executed leader <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> attacked the television building in the capital early Wednesday but were repulsed in a half-hour firefight, news reports said. The television building is the headquarters of the provisional government headed by new President <PERSON> Ion </PERSON> <PERSON> Iliescu </PERSON>, who on Wednesday spoke with <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and expressed his thanks for the Soviet leader's support. The men are friends from their college days in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dumitru </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazilu </PERSON>, vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> provisional government, reaffirmed that the new leaders are devoted to replacing <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s 24-year Stalinist despotism with democracy. The government has said free elections will be held in April. `` We want <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> to become a member of the free civilized world,'' <PERSON> Mazilu </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> is no longer a Communist country. <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> is a free land, and we will create a real democracy.'' But the revolutionary government still is fighting a guerrilla war with <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> loyalists, although the battles are waning. Romanian news reports said security police were holding out in `` isolated positions'' in other parts of the country, but army forces backing the revolt were for the most part in control. Trying to heal the wounds of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s revolution, the interim leadership offered the possibility of lenient penalties to <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s security forces if they surrendered. But there were suggestions those who did not give up could face the same fate as the <ORGANIZATION> Ceausescus </ORGANIZATION>, who were reported executed by firing squad on Monday. According to a communique read on <ORGANIZATION> Bucharest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>, security police members have until Thursday afternoon to surrender or they'll be `` tried and condemned'' by special tribunals. `` If they surrender voluntarily, with their weapons, they will be tried and the death penalty will not be applied,'' the communique said. Loyalist <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> forces have been launching their attacks in <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> from a maze of tunnels built by the dictator for the feared security police. On Wednesday night, Romanian TV showed nervous soldiers combing the tunnels in search of members of the security police, known as the Securitate. The soldiers found bottles of whiskey, radio equipment, food and weapons caches, and at least one gas mask _ but no security police. The army troops kicked open doors leading to small rooms in the tunnels. At one point, a young soldier tipped back his helmet and wiped his brow after forcing his way into one of the rooms. His frightened expression reflected Romanians' fear of the Securitate. Unconfirmed reports have said <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s police have walked into hospitals hiding knives to carry out acts of terrorism, and poisoned village wells. There have been reports that Securitate forces have been surrendering en masse after battling army units backing the revolution and armed citizens. However, there have been no figures on how many <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> loyalists have given up. Elsewhere, Romanian TV on Wednesday showed workers taking down <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> signs and slogans from buildings in <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Corneliu </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogdan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s new deputy foreign minister, said that while bureaucrats who worked for years under <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> still are in positions of power, the new government wants a clean, peaceful break with the past. `` They are not all criminals, they were at the most too servile and obedient. We must try to avoid a witch hunt at any costs,'' he said. The governing committee headed by <PERSON> Iliescu </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> secretary ousted for challenging <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, is made up of dissidents, intellectuals and disaffected army commanders and former government officials. In their conversation, <PERSON> Iliescu </PERSON> told <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> the situation in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> was returning to normal and that 90 percent of the factories were back at work, the Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. It said <PERSON> Iliescu </PERSON> thanked <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> for a resolution passed by Soviet lawmakers expressing support for the revolution at a time when its outcome was in doubt. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> named a new foreign minister, university professor <PERSON> Sergiu </PERSON> <PERSON> Celac </PERSON>, 58. His predecessor, <PERSON> Ion </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoian </PERSON>, has been ousted with <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s ruling cabal. Relief flights were arriving in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> as the country struggled to recover from nearly two weeks of upheaval. At <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> airport, more than 40 relief aircraft had arrived by Wednesday. `` There is even too much aid,'' said <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kouchner </PERSON>, French minister for humanitarian affairs. `` We have to decide what is needed and then coordinate.'' The revolution began with a protest in the western town of <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION> on Dec. 15, and escalated into huge demonstrations in which thousands are believed to have been slain. Thousands were reported massacred by troops in <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION> and dumped into mass graves. During his trial, <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> was accused of being responsible for the killing of 60,000 people during his 24-year reign. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> fled his palace Friday after army units joined the revolt. Since then, the revolutionary government has been fighting urban guerrilla attacks by secret police. He was captured Saturday. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was `` amazed'' at the changes that have taken place in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. `` We did say we were concerned that the trial of <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> should have been more open, but that's their matter,'' he said. <PERSON> Petre </PERSON> <PERSON> Roman </PERSON>, the country's new interim prime minister, defended the secret trial and quick executions of <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Elena </PERSON>. `` We were in circumstances which did not permit us to wait longer in a situation of instability. There were pressures. We had information concerning possible attacks on the place where he was,'' Roman told French TV. Roman previously has said there had been indications secret police were making plans to try to free <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>. At the once-prestigious university library, 500,000 volumes, including some precious manuscripts, were burned in a fire sparked by the fighting. But at the National Library, the only books destroyed were six long shelves of the works of <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>: pages upon pages of his revised Stalinist socialism. From the first signs of <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s forced departure Friday, staff members began baling the dusty volumes to be destroyed. `` No one ever read this stuff, no one,'' said <PERSON> Virgil </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiberiu </PERSON> <PERSON> Spanu </PERSON>, director of acquisitions. `` Never.'' Romanians were exultant Wednesday after state TV showed the <ORGANIZATION> Ceausescus </ORGANIZATION> being tried, as well as photos of the couple lying dead next to a bullet-riddled wall. The firing squad was eager to execute the couple, according to a man who said he was on the tribunal that tried the <ORGANIZATION> Ceausescus </ORGANIZATION>. `` We were n't even able to film -LRB- the execution -RRB- because the soldiers lost control, they could no longer wait to fire,'' the man told the network FR3 in from <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>. He declined to give his name but who appeared to be the same man who was shown on Romanian TV with <PERSON> Iliescu </PERSON> last week. <PERSON> Bogdan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lazaraen </PERSON>, a 21-year-old engineering student, shook his head when asked about the executions. `` A week ago he was screaming at us and calling us fascists and terrorists,'' he said. `` And now to see him lying in some obscure place, shot.''

 Sinhalese radicals stormed a wedding party in southern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> and stabbed to death four guests whom they accused of being government spies, military officials said Wednesday. Thirty-two other people, including some Sinhalese extremists, were reported killed since Tuesday in violence inspired by Sinhalese militants of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. The wedding party attack occurred Tuesday night in <LOCATION> Urubokke </LOCATION>, 85 miles south of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, the officials said. All the victims were Sinhalese men, and all the killers escaped. In the nearby city of <LOCATION> Tangalle </LOCATION>, extremists blew up a truck Wednesday, killing three policemen and a soldier, the officials said without elaboration. Also Wednesday, extremists shot to death two supporters of the governing <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The truck explosion occurred hours after police found the burned bodies of 13 young Sinhalese men who had been shot. It was not known who killed the men, but the method was similar to that used by vigilante groups who allegedly kill civilians suspected of associating with the radical People's <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. Government troops killed 12 front members in three separate incidents since Tuesday in central and southern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, officials said. Sinhalese extremists began a violent campaign in 1987 to protest an accord the government approved in an effort to end a war by minority Tamils demanding more autonomy. Ultranationalist Sinhalese claimed the Sinhalese-controlled government made too many concessions to the Tamils, who comprise 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people. At least 11,000 people have died in the Tamil insurrection, while another 6,000 have been killed in the Sinhalese backlash. Sinhalese make up 75 percent of the population. Tamils say the Sinhalese discriminate against them in jobs, education and use of the language.

 The <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> has been increasing its working hours gradually as employees return to work, but 125 ships were backed up Wednesday waiting to cross the isthmus, a canal official said. The canal was shut down to all ship traffic for the first 48 hours after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops invaded <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> Dec. 20. It resumed operation during daylight hours, but halted work at night because not enough employees could get to work. `` Some people are actually walking to work, as much as 15 miles, because there's no public transport,'' said <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Friar </PERSON>, a spokeswoman at <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> headquarters just west of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. But there is still a bottleneck of ships from around the world at the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> entrances waiting to pass through the canal, she said. `` We have 125 ships waiting,'' Ms. <PERSON> Friar </PERSON> said. Buses and taxis have begun cruising <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> streets, but gasoline is hard to find following a looting spree. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Col. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Murguia </PERSON> said gasoline was being distributed to service stations as life slowly returned to normal. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> is on the canal's southern end along the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, and the town of Colon is on the canal's northern mouth on the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> coast. The canal normally can handle 42 ships a day. Under its 12-hour daylight operations, only 12 ships a day passed through, Ms. <PERSON> Friar </PERSON> said. On Tuesday, as more employees returned to work, the canal began work at 3 a.m. and stopped operations 16 hours later. `` Today -LRB- Wednesday -RRB- we're hoping to go to 24 hours, but we do n't know,'' Ms. <PERSON> Friar </PERSON> said `` We are now assessing the number of employees'' that have shown up for work. Neither the canal nor any ships suffered damage during the fighting, she said. In 1988, 12,261 ships went through the canal. There are 7,602 full-time employees, of whom 86 percent are Panamanians. Last week's closing was the first time the canal has shut down for anything but natural disaster since its opening in 1914. The commission has both <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Panamanian members. Under a 1977 treaty, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will turn over operation of the canal to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> at the end of 1999.

 <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s new president thanked Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on Wednesday for backing the revolution that ended 24 years of Stalinist dictatorship in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc nation, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s provisional revolutionary leader, <PERSON> Ion </PERSON> <PERSON> Iliescu </PERSON>, spoke with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> by telephone and expressed appreciation for a supportive Soviet resolution that came at the height of the revolt, the Soviet news agency said. <PERSON> Iliescu </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> reportedly are old friends from their college days in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Iliescu </PERSON> is leader of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that took power in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> after the downfall of dictator <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>. The revolutionary government says it is a provisional leadership until free elections are held in April. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> was forced to flee his palace on Friday but fierce fighting between loyalist and revolutionary forces left the outcome of the insurrection in doubt for days. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, speaking to the Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> on Friday, suggested that a resolution be approved urging support for the <LOCATION> Romanian </LOCATION> people's `` just cause.'' <PERSON> Iliescu </PERSON> reportedly was particularly grateful for that support. <PERSON> Iliescu </PERSON> also told <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> the situation in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> was returning to normal and that 90 percent of the factories were back at work, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> congratulated <PERSON> Iliescu </PERSON> on his election as head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> at a time when patriots are trying to rescue the nation from `` forces of terror.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s message in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> was strikingly different from the usual formal congratulations of a new leader because it was signed simply <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, with no title. `` You have taken the leadership of the country in a very difficult hour for it, when the Romanian patriots have decisively moved to rescue the nations from the forces of disorder and terror, in order to install a truly <ORGANIZATION> democratic </ORGANIZATION> order in your country,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s statement said. He went on to assure <PERSON> Iliescu </PERSON> that the Romanians `` will receive the full support of the peoples and the leadership of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on their road to renewal.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Iliescu </PERSON> reportedly knew each other as university students in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> three decades ago. <PERSON> Iliescu </PERSON> was a leader in the <ORGANIZATION> Romanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> until criticizing <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>. Still, the Soviet recognition of an informal government was unusual and indicative of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s efforts to clear out the vestiges of Stalinism in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc. Reform movements with tacit Soviet approval have ousted regimes in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, a former aide to ousted East German leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> said Wednesday that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had a hand in ousting hard-line East German leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> reportedly urged <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> to embrace reform during the Soviet leader's state visit in October.

 Disney let Captain Hook and Captain <PERSON> Nemo </PERSON> wear mustaches, but First Officer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Magness </PERSON> of the Queen <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> _ the only real-life seaman of the three _ was ordered Wednesday to shave it off or ship out. <PERSON> Magness </PERSON>, the No. 3 officer on the Disney-operated ship, was sent home on a one-day suspension for violating the <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s grooming policy, which forbids beards and mustaches If <PERSON> Magness </PERSON> goes ahead with plans to keep his mustache, by next week he will have run out of suspensions and will join three other crew members _ two waiters and a busboy _ who were fired for wearing mustaches. `` It's a matter of principle,'' said <PERSON> Magness </PERSON>, 65, whose mustache is little more than a thin gray tuft. `` I've had that mustache for 42 years now. My wife wants me to keep it. My kids have not seen me without it. So there it stays.'' The policy is so strict that company founder, the mustachioed <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>, would be in violation, along with many famous <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> characters, from Uncle <PERSON> Remus </PERSON> to six of the seven dwarfs. Much of <PERSON> Minnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouse </PERSON>'s wardrobe would be too gaudy for Disney. <PERSON> Magness </PERSON>, who wore his mustache in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> through 13 engagements in World War II and three engagements in the Korean War, summed up his feelings for the policy in two words: `` It stinks.'' The flap was the latest in several disputes over what critics have called <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>'s overly conservative practices. The Burbank-based company, for instance, lost its battle to ban homosexuals from dancing together at <LOCATION> Disneyland </LOCATION>. The 35-year-old grooming policy just went into effect his month at the Disney-operated Queen <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, permanently docked in <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, 25 miles south of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Two of the employees were fired Christmas Eve. Disney bought the leasehold to the Queen <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> two years ago, along with the adjacent Spruce Goose plane, built by <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, a billionaire with a mustache. The ship is run as an attraction, and officers such as <PERSON> Magness </PERSON> basically are in charge of answering visitors' questions. The grooming policy, which applies to all park and hotel employees, bans mustaches, beards and long hair on men. Bright eye shadow, red fingernails or two-toned hair on women are also forbidden. Queen <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerlin </PERSON> said that enforcing the policy was a matter of keeping the Disney empire consistent, although he would not say why the company was so strict on facial hair. `` It's just that it's been a policy for 35 years,'' he remarked, adding that <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> himself instituted the policy. `` If we allowed the Queen <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> employees to have mustaches, we'd have to let the entire theme park and resort employees do the same,'' the spokesman said <PERSON> Kerlin </PERSON> said that the only exceptions to the no-mustache rule were if an employee needed one for `` medical reasons.'' So far, 90 of the 100 men with mustaches agreed to shave them off. Others, like <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Nazertehrani </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicolai </PERSON>, refused. They were fired Dec. 24 from their jobs as waiters and plan to protest the policy with their union. `` I feel I have a right as a person to live in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ a free country _ and to not shave my mustache,'' said <PERSON> Nazertehrani </PERSON>. `` I am Iranian. It is part of my culture. We are very proud to have a mustache.''

<HEAD>Lebanon Asks Hostages' Release, Complains to U.N. About Israeli Attacks</HEAD>

 The government on Wednesday appealed to all kidnappers in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to release their hostages. Eighteen Westerners, including eight Americans, are being held here, most by Shiite Moslem extremists. In other action, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> recognized the new governments in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and announced it was lodging an urgent complaint with the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> about new Israeli attacks that killed 12 people and wounded 31. In a separate development, a high-ranking Iranian envoy called a cease-fire late in the day to halt five days of fighting between rival Shiite Moslem militias in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Shortly afterward, police said the fighting dwindled to sporadic sniping. `` The big guns gave fallen silent, and that's a good sign. But unless the sniping is quickly halted, the situation could explode again,'' said a police spokesman, who can not be identified under standing rules. Information Minister <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Rizk </PERSON> read the government's plea to hostage-takers after a two-hour Cabinet meeting held under President <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> and Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> at an army base in east <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. `` On the occasion of Christmas and the New Year, the president, the prime minister and the council of ministers appeal jointly to all hostage-holders to release them,'' the official statement said. The plea is likely to have no impact on pro-Iranian factions holding most of the 18 hostages because government authority has been eroded by 14 years of civil war between Moslems and Christians. The hostage held the longest is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He was abducted March 16, 1985. On Tuesday, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> ground and air attacks wiped out two guerrilla bases of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in central and southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The ground assault was <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s largest in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since December 1988, and the air attack was the deadliest of 18 such raids this year. <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>' office said instructions were being transmitted to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mission to complain of `` this blatant aggression.'' The complaint, issued Wednesday, reserved the right to request a special meeting of the council, said <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chawki </PERSON> <PERSON> Choueri </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s permanent representative to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> Paratroopers backed by tanks and helicopter gunships destroyed a guerrilla base of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in southeast <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> before dawn Tuesday and warplanes blasted a Communist command post at sunset. Rescuers worked overnight to dig out victims from the rubble of the two-story command post in <LOCATION> Rmeile </LOCATION>, 20 miles south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Police put the final toll of the Rmeile attack at 10 killed, 28 wounded. Eighteen such air strikes have killed 28 people and wounded 137 since Jan. 11. The earlier ground assault on the base in the southeastern village of <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Safi </PERSON> killed two Communist guerrillas and wounded three. In south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, the rival militias battled early Wednesday. But <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s first deputy foreign minister, <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Besharti </PERSON>, said leaders of the Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> and the Syrian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> militias pledged to abide by the cease-fire. Police said eight people were killed and 37 wounded in artillery and tank fire duels Tuesday and Wednesday. That raised the overall toll to 46 people killed and 187 wounded since the current round of fighting erupted Saturday. The two factions have vied for control over <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 1.2 million Shiites, the country's largest sect, for more than two years. Since the intermittent power struggle began in May 1987, 617 people have been killed and 1,766 wounded.

<HEAD>Bulgarian Communists to Hold Talks With Opposition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The ruling Communists and an opposition coalition agreed Wednesday to hold wide-ranging talks on <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s future government Some workers staged brief strikes as a warning to the Communists. Following the agreement, an independent trade union called off a general strike scheduled for Thursday. The union demands the resignation of the government, the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. In other developments Wednesday, the government fired Interior Minister <PERSON> Georgi </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanev </PERSON> following criticism of police violence against demonstrators in October. The official <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION> news agency gave no reason for his ouster. The announcements are the latest in a series of changes since <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s longtime hard-line Communist leader, <PERSON> Todor </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON>, was ousted Nov. 10. Since then, amid a wave of democratic reform that has swept <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, leaders have scrapped a law forbidding dissent, proposed free elections in May and granted amnesty to political prisoners. The ruling party reached agreement with the opposition coalition, the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, `` toward holding consultations'' beginning Tuesday or Wednesday, said <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Angelov </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The talks were characterized as being similar to those in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> that led to a government dominated by non-Communists. For the first time in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, strikes were held throughout the country Wednesday, but only small groups of workers took part. The two-hour strikes were intended as a warning to Communist leaders. The independent union Support withdrew its Thursday strike call following the agreement, said chairman <PERSON> Konstantin </PERSON> <PERSON> Trenchev </PERSON>. Support's job action was not backed by most of the independent organizations in the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, which said workers should strike only after all other forms of a dialogue are exhausted. <PERSON> Plamen </PERSON> <PERSON> Darakchiev </PERSON>, a secretary of Support, said the trade union `` will not relinquish its demands but make them in a categoric way'' at the talks with the Communists. <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Tanev </PERSON> was replaced as Interior Minister by Gen. <PERSON> Atanas </PERSON> <PERSON> Semerdzhiev </PERSON>, the army's chief of staff. <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION> said the deputy foreign minister, <PERSON> Lyuben </PERSON> <PERSON> Gotsev </PERSON>, would move to the No. 2 position at the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, which is responsible for the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc country's police and internal security <PERSON> Tanev </PERSON>, 48, was blamed for the Oct. 26 crackdown on demonstrators of the then-banned Eco-Glasnost environmental group. The government said at least 22 people protesting in <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION> against a government hydroelectric project were beaten and kicked by police, and Western diplomats said from 30 to 40 were detained. The police action embarrassed the Bulgarian leadership because it drew sharp criticism from delegates to a 35-nation ecological forum in <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION> taking place at the time. The group was later legalized. At the last session of the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Dec. 14, <PERSON> Tanev </PERSON> read a long statement on the incident, rejecting all responsibility. He said he had only learned of the police action afterward. Under <PERSON> Tanev </PERSON>, a police squad that cracked down on human rights activists and political opponents was in operation. Under new Communist leader <PERSON> Petar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON>, it was disbanded Nov. 25.

 <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> has decided to resume joint anti-drug operations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, a week after the Peruvian leader halted the activity to protest the invasion of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON>, a department spokesman, said the `` reconstituted joint efforts in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'' between Drug Enforcement Administration and Peruvian officials began Tuesday. The Peruvian Embassy said joint operations resumed because `` the fight against drugs is so important.''' The anti-drug operations ceased after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> on Dec. 20. Peruvian officials called the invasion an `` outrage against <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' At the time, Peruvian President <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said he would boycott the Feb. 15 drug summit that is to be held in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plans to attend. An embassy official, speaking on condition he remain anonymous, said he did n't know whether <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> had changed his mind and would attend. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, talking to reporters as he began a vacation in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Wednesday, said, `` I would hope that <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> would change his mind.'' He said that `` inasmuch as <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> is an Andean country and this is an Andean summit with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> participating, trying to help them, I would think it would be lessened _ you know, less inclusive, obviously _ but I'd think that there are ways to continue to help <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> in this fight.'' The Peruvian embassy official said Peruvian officials intend to send representatives to a meeting in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> on Jan. 10 at which officials from <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Quito </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> will coordinate strategy for the drug summit. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> finances a number of joint operations aimed at wiping out the drug trade from <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>. They include anti-drug patrols in the <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huallaga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> where most of the Peruvian coca leaf is derived. Cocaine is derived from coca. <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agents also work on joint paramilitary operations with the Peruvians and help them with investigations, including locating drug traffickers.

 Federal investigators Wednesday began examining the wreckage of a commuter plane for the cause of a crash that killed all six people aboard. The twin-engine <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> turboprop went down in a field and burst into flames just short of the runway late Tuesday while en route from <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Pasco </LOCATION> via <LOCATION> Yakima </LOCATION>. At a news conference, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Belmondo </PERSON> raised the possibility that wing icing contributed to the crash but said it was `` much too early to speculate'' on the cause. Fire officials found ice at the crash scene but <PERSON> Belmondo </PERSON> said it had not been determined whether the ice came from the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jetstream </ORGANIZATION> 31, a 19-passenger plane. The crew contacted the airline's dispatch center at the <LOCATION> Tri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> here within three to five miles of landing, as is routine, and gave no indication of a problem, <PERSON> Belmondo </PERSON> said. He did not know if there was any communication between the plane and the airport tower after that. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Duff </PERSON> said the plane hit 100 feet short of the runway; <PERSON> Belmondo </PERSON> said it went in 500 to 700 feet short. Investigators from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> safety <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> arrived Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> has deicing equipment at <LOCATION> Yakima </LOCATION> but it was not immediately known if it was used on the plane before its departure for <LOCATION> Pasco </LOCATION>, a flight of about 80 miles which usually takes about 30 minutes. Visibility at the time of the crash was seven miles and wind was calm, <PERSON> Duff </PERSON> said. The plane was not equipped with voice and flight data recorders that larger commercial airlines are required to carry. The plane was built in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> in 1987 and delivered to <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> in December of that year, <PERSON> Belmondo </PERSON> said. It had 5,000 hours of flight time and had its last maintenance inspection on Dec. 20, he said. The aircraft had no record of any major mechanical problems, he said. The pilot, Capt. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, 38, had more than 11 years of regional flying experience with more than 6,600 hours of total flying time, including more than 660 hours in British <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jetstream </ORGANIZATION> aircraft, <PERSON> Belmondo </PERSON> said. Co-pilot <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> McInroe </PERSON>, 25, joined <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> in August with more than two years flying experience, <PERSON> Belmondo </PERSON> said. He said he did not know who was piloting the plane when it crashed. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>, based at <LOCATION> Pasco </LOCATION>, serves 15 cities in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>.

 A strike-bound coal company sued the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> for $ 60 million Wednesday, accusing the union and its members of attempted murder, arson and extortion as part of a nationwide racketeering scheme. The lawsuit was filed in federal court in <LOCATION> Beckley </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beckley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which also announced it will close its nearby <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> mine because of what it called union violence stemming from the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION>'s selective strikes. The UMW has been on strike against <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beckley </LOCATION> since January, idling 130 miners. The union also is engaged in a bitter strike against the <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>. The lawsuit was filed under the Racketeer Influenced, Corrupt Organizations Act. Although the racketeering statute was intended by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> primarily as a tool against organized crime, it been used frequently against unions, including a 1988 lawsuit by the government against the the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>. Earlier this year, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upheld the use of the statute against legitimate organizations, despite complaints by the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> that it had become `` a tool of harassment ... against legitimate businesses and labor organizations.'' The New Beckley Mining lawsuit cites alleged violence at more than 20 coal companies in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> since 1983, when the union began its selective strike strategy, in which the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> targeted specific companies for work stoppages. Previous strikes were industrywide. The lawsuit alleges that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beckley </LOCATION> employees have been the targets of vandalism, death threats, shootings and beatings at work and at home. The violence `` pervades the coal industry, discouraging productivity and inhibiting the economic well-being of individuals living and working in coal-producing communities,'' the lawsuit says. Union spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Duray </PERSON> called the lawsuit `` ridiculous'' and accused the company of engaging in a `` press-release lawsuit'' by hiring a public relations company to notify the news media of the filing. `` It looks to me like these guys are a lot more interested in trying their case in the media than in court,'' <PERSON> Duray </PERSON> said. District 29 President <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Acord </PERSON> said he knew nothing of the lawsuit or the mine closing. At a news conference on the courthouse steps, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beckley </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasell </PERSON> said: `` The decision to shut down and seal <PERSON> New </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckley </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Mine </PERSON> was reached because the continued organized violence orchestrated against <PERSON> New </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckley </PERSON> by the <ORGANIZATION> UMWA </ORGANIZATION> has reached an intolerable level of acceptability by any rational standard. `` Marauding pickets continue to cause great hardship upon the company and its families on a daily basis.'' The lawsuit contends that the union has engaged in a pattern of racketeering that includes 34 counts of attempted murder, 23 of arson and 79 of extortion. Under the RICO statute, the company's requested $ 20 million in damages can be tripled if the union and various individuals are found to have violated the act.

<TEXT>
 The Army has been flooded with offers from volunteers who want to go to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and help restore battered public services, a spokesman said Wednesday. `` It's unbelievable,'' said Maj. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitts </PERSON>, a spokesman at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> `` Call it patriotism, call it boredom, call it what you will, but we've had to set up a 24-hour operation just to screen the volunteers,'' <PERSON> Fitts </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> already has dispatched 25 reserve civil affairs specialists along with 107 active duty experts to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Civil affairs specialists act as liaison officers between the military and the civilian government to help re-establish public services disrupted by fighting, such as utilities and transportation. Virtually all the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s civil affairs specialists are in reserve units, and the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> paged those units for volunteers, <PERSON> Fitts </PERSON> said. `` We've -LRB- in the reserves -RRB- been requested by the -LRB- regular -RRB- Special Operations Command to augment the active duty civil affairs officers in their effort to rebuild and restore order in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' he said. The Army particularly sought specialists, such as engineers or people familiar with transit systems or sanitation programs. So many have volunteered, <PERSON> Fitts </PERSON> said in a telephone interview, that he's been unable to get a count. The number to be chosen to go to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> probably will be `` in the dozens, rather than hundreds, because we really need people with specific talents,'' he said. Most people can be expected to put in about two weeks, but regulations permit a tour of duty of up to 139 days, a bit less than 20 weeks. In <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, soldiers from the 361st Civil Affairs Bridgade in <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> and a subordinate unit, the <ORGANIZATION> 478th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Perrine </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, will leave Friday for <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, said Maj. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bechtell </PERSON>, a member of the brigade. Lt. Col. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Randall </PERSON>, plans and operations officer of the brigade, said his unit will `` help the government with certain expertise our individuals have in banking, utilities, medical -LRB- matters -RRB-, public transportation, law enforcement and education.'' The 361st trains in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> every year and routinely works with the civil government and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military there, <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> said. About 25 percent of the Pensacola-based reservists and half of those in <PERSON> Perrine </PERSON> speak Spanish, he said.

<TEXT>
 The former president and later <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> drew 12 years in prison Wednesday for bribe-taking in a scandal that touched many officials in the Central Asian republic, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The court also ordered an investigation into the prosecution's action in arresting relatives of the defendant, <PERSON> Inamzhon </PERSON> <PERSON> Usmankhodzhayev </PERSON>. The Uzbek was found guilty of accepting $ 82,100 in bribes `` discrediting state and party bodies, and severely damaging the interests of the state and society,'' the Soviet news agency reported. All his property was confiscated. He was party first secretary from 1983 to January 1988, when he retired on a pension. Prior to that, he was president of <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> for five years. Prosecutors <PERSON> Telman </PERSON> <PERSON> Gdlyan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivanov </PERSON> became instant celebrities when they said their Uzbek corruption probe reached into the ruling Politburo. But the two then were themselves accused of forcing confessions and other improprities in their investigations. The public rallied around the two prosecutors during the scandal. Both prosecutors are now members of parliament and no charges have been filed against them. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> described the scene outside the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> courtroom as tumultous after the court's rulings Wednesday. `` Gdlyan and <PERSON> Ivanov </PERSON> should have sat on that -LRB- defendants' -RRB- bench!

 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> asked four European nations Wednesday to freeze bank accounts where former Panamanian dictator <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is thought to have hidden illegal drug profits. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON>, a department spokesman, said the legal papers were filed with the governments of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>, requesting authorities to order banks to block any transactions in the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> accounts. `` The request is of money directly tied to his alleged illegal drug trafficking,'' <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said, adding there is `` more than one account in each country.'' Authorities in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> responded to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> request by freezing accounts in two banks holding $ 3.3 million under the names of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and members of his families. Swiss officials placed a `` precautionary'' freeze on two accounts in banks in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. French investigators said the banks in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> may have been used as transit points for funds destined for <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. The Swiss <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> request charged <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> with giving `` logistic support'' to Colombian drug lords' shipments to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who is hiding in the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Embassy </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, is thought to have transferred at least $ 10 million into numerous accounts in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials, however, say <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s personal wealth could total as much as $ 300 million. Deposed as dictator by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops on Dec. 20, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has been charged in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in two drug trafficking indictments. <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said department lawyers are confident they can document that money <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> sent abroad had been earned illegally in the drug trade. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops seized a slew of records in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was ousted. The four European countries are expected to cooperate with the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> request, rules of which are spelled out in international treaties. `` We have had a remarkable display of international cooperation,'' <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. `` These letters were not sprung on these countries this morning.'' Once the bank accounts have been frozen _ as <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> expects _ there is still the possibility they will be barren, <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. It's conceivable, he said, that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, his family or his bankers moved money out of accounts since the invasion. Freezing assets is the first step to seizing them, said <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON>. `` These things are not easy processes.'' Any disposition of the money, however, would be by international agreements. Preliminary discussions were also under way with others countries where <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> might has stashed money, <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. But he is not thought to have assets in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> estimates put <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s worth at between $ 200 million to $ 300 million, much of it hidden in secret bank accounts abroad. In a speech last August, Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> alluded to multimillion-dollar transactions <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has made over the past two years involving accounts in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>. The private gains <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has accumulated, <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> said, belie the image he has projected of a `` poor youth of humble origins who by virtue of individual effort, merit and talent rose through the ranks to become head of a small but respectable military force.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday urged <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s new government to prevent attacks on Arabs following reports that Arab mercenaries fought for its executed dictator. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> cautioned Romanian reformers to refrain from revenge attacks. Civic Forum, the Czechoslovak opposition group, said Wednesday the Czechoslovak consulate in <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> had confirmed reports of 2,000 foreign mercenaries fighting with those loyal to executed dictator <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>. `` They were positive about Libyans and indicated Syrians and Palestinians'' were involved, Civic Forum spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Zantovsky </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> after returning from <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>. He added that the number of mercenaries could be even higher. Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> spoke by telephone with <PERSON> Ion </PERSON> <PERSON> Iliescu </PERSON>, the new interim president, who thanked his old college chum for his support. For the first time, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> criticized <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, who had been highly regarded for his support of the Jewish state in the face of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc opposition. <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s former King <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, who said he would be willing to return, said the new government may collapse. Emergency aid poured into the country and relief agencies said they needed money and blood rather than more food, clothing and other supplies. The list of nations recognizing the new government grew longer. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> promised all possible humanitarian asssistance to <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> and said he hoped the transition to democracy would be peaceful. Some countries, including <LOCATION> Czecholsovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, the first nation to recognize the new government, arranged for diplomats to travel to <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. The provisional government, called the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, took power after <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s ouster Friday, saying it will hold power until elections can be held in April. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Elena </PERSON>, were executed by a firing squad Monday, the government said. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was `` amazed'' at the changes that have taken place in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. `` We did say we were concerned that the trial of <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> should have been more open, but that's their matter,'' he said, adding that army seemed to be bringing the remaining pro-Ceausescu forces under control. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shangkun </PERSON> on Wednesday sent congratulations to <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s new leaders and expressed hope for continued friendship between the countries. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s government had close ties with <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> was one of the few world leaders to praise <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s military crackdown of the student democracy movement in June. British Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> praised `` the extraordinary courage'' of the Romanian people in a warm message of support to <PERSON> Iliescu </PERSON>. But Foreign Office Minister <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldegrave </PERSON> said: `` There must n't be a bloodbath of revenge now.'' <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, although expressing support for the new <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> government, criticized the <ORGANIZATION> Ceausescus </ORGANIZATION>' execution without a public trial. Officials from the 22-member Arab League met with the <LOCATION> Romanian </LOCATION> ambassador in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, to demand that Romanian officials promise that Arabs living in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> not be subjected to `` bad treatment,'' a statement said. The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> alleged Tuesday its diplomatic staff and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> students in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> have been attacked in recent days. Several Eastern European news agencies have accused Palestinians, Libyans and Syrians of fighting alongside security forces loyal to <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> have denied the reports. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, a statement by Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> was the first time <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> openly criticized <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>. Referring to the thousands of victims of the anti-Ceausescu rebellion, <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> said, `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> condemns the terrible massacres carried out by <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s security forces.'' <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> was the only <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc leader to maintain ties with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> after the 1967 Middle East War, when the others sided with the Arabs. Joining the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and a score of states recognizing the new Romanian leadership were <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, whose hard-line Communist government, led by <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON>, was often compared to <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s. However, <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, who was deposed in 1947 when the Communists took over and now lives in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, said he did not expect the new government to last. `` The crowds do not accept what's there now, because they -LRB- the government -RRB- have communist backgrounds. They have come from <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s party, they worked with him before. So I do n't think the people will accept this,'' he said in a <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> television interview broadcast Wednesday night. The king, who said he would return home immediately if he was wanted, called the plan to hold elections in April `` a little premature'' because <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s political system had been destroyed over the past 40 years. `` So there is actually no political groundwork to have elections so soon,'' he said. Countries and charities sent or pledged millions of dollars, food, tons of medical supplies and equipment and doctors and nurses to help Romanians. <PERSON> Rony </PERSON> <PERSON> Brauman </PERSON>, president of the non-governmental aid agency Doctors Without Borders which has 43 people working in 13 Romanian cities, said in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> the most pressing need is money. `` The urgent needs of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> for drugs and medical and surgical material are now covered,'' said <PERSON> Brauman </PERSON>. `` The problem now is forwarding and distributing this aid as it's needed.'' A <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> official told relief workers in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> that blood is the most urgent necessity. A committee has been set up in <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> under the auspices of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to coordinate assistance arriving in <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> said. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> urged people to send money, not goods. It said 500 tons of food, clothing, blankets and medical supplies have arrived or are en route. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> said it has received information that one <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> volunteer was fatally shot Friday while bringing relief supplies to the western city of <LOCATION> Timisoara </LOCATION>.

 The rebel <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> recently put to death 17 of its senior officers and imprisoned 29 others, a ministerial source was quoted by the <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> as saying Wednesday. The new report said no explanation was offered for the orders purportedly given by rebel leader <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Garang </PERSON>. The agency quoted the source as saying the rebels imprisoned 29 officers ranging from captain to lieutenant colonel `` while at the same time demanding that the government release political detainees and observe human rights.'' The military government jailed ousted Prime Minister <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Mahdi </PERSON> and about 50 other senior political leaders after the military took power in a coup June 30. It says they will be tried for political and economic corruption. The ministerial source said that of the rebels' five-man military council, only <PERSON> Garang </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Noun </PERSON> remained. He identified the other three only as <PERSON> Karbino </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Silvar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Arok </PERSON> <PERSON> Toun </PERSON>, and said all were in jail. No immediate comment came from the rebels. The Christian and animist rebel army took up arms against the Moslem majority government in the north in 1983. The rebels demand more autonomy and a greater share in the country's economic wealth.

 Dozens of store owners whose shops were sacked by frenzied looting after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion were told Wednesday that `` acts of war'' were not covered by their insurance policies. `` We regret to inform you that the claim you have submitted ... must be rejected because the insurance policy excludes losses suffered as a direct or indirect result of acts of war,'' said one letter Panamanian insurance companies were mailing Wednesday to their clients. Conservative estimates by insurance brokers and store owners put the damage and losses between $ 750 million and $ 1 billion, according to <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Maduro </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Panamanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Maduro </PERSON> said Panamanian businessmen will now ask the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for direct assistance to try to recover losses and resume operations. `` This is a bomb worse than the ones of last Wednesday.

Businessmen have estimated that more than 90 percent of the shops were looted on <LOCATION> Via </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Espana </LOCATION> and Central Avenue, two commercial streets in downtown <LOCATION> Panana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Thousands of looters raided everything from food, furniture, televisions and appliances. Only bookstores survived. <PERSON> Lazaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Gago </PERSON>, owner of the <PERSON> Gago </PERSON> supermarket chain, said six of his nine establishments had been looted and added his company was `` in ruins.'' Eight of nine of the Arrocha pharmacies also were looted. A car company said it lost $ 4 million to looters. <ORGANIZATION> Avis </ORGANIZATION> and other rental companies still were looking for cars taken from their lots. Television stations ran ads from car distributors offering rewards for information leading to the recovery of new vehicles. Looting damage in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dorado </LOCATION>, a shopping center for upper middle neighborhoods, was estimated at $ 25 million. <PERSON> Maduro </PERSON> said the chamber would ask for direct <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance `` in the form of equipment, technology and interest-ree loans, something like a Marshall Plan for <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.'' `` It is our responsibility to rebuild the economy,'' <PERSON> Maduro </PERSON> said, `` but we do not have the capacity at this time.'' Both <PERSON> Maduro </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON> regretted the damage was done mostly by Panamanians. `` We have committed a grievous mistake,'' <PERSON> Maduro </PERSON> added. `` We attacked our own business establishments while the Americans were attacking military targets only.''

<HEAD>Archbishop Says Priest's Slaying May Have Been Politically Motivated</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The slaying of a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> priest in southeastern <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> may have been politically motivated and not the work of robbers, a Brazilian archbishop said Wednesday. The Rev. <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Maire </PERSON> `` had been receiving death threats for the past several months due to his work on behalf of justice and human rights for the poor,'' Archbishop <PERSON> Silvestre </PERSON> <PERSON> Scandian </PERSON> said by phone from <LOCATION> Vitoria </LOCATION>. Police found <PERSON> Maire </PERSON>, 53, shot in the chest and slumped over the wheel of his car Saturday on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Vitoria </LOCATION>, 310 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>. Police arrested two suspects and charged them with shooting <PERSON> Maire </PERSON> during an attempted robbery. Scandian disputed the police report, saying <PERSON> Maire </PERSON>'s wristwatch and other personal items were left in the car. A bag containing his cassock and empty wallet was found about 100 yards from the scene. The Rev. <PERSON> Mauricio </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattos </PERSON> <PERSON> Pereira </PERSON>, of the Archdiocese's <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, said three other politically motivated killings occurred in nearby towns since June `` When you try to raise the consciousness of the small, the big react,'' said <PERSON> Pereira </PERSON>. `` They want to silence all those trying to show the poor the roots of injustice.'' <PERSON> Maire </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> in 1980 and worked in the lower-class parish of <LOCATION> Vila </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Velha </LOCATION>, eight miles south of <LOCATION> Vitoria </LOCATION>. Thousands of people attended a wake for Maire on Tuesday. The priest's body will be flown to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> on Thursday, maccording to <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Seixas </PERSON> <PERSON> Correa </PERSON>, a spokeswoman at the French consulate in <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>. The Roman Catholic Church here estimates more than 800 people have been assassinated for political reasons since <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> returned to civilian rule after a right-wing military dictatorship ruled from 1964 to 1985. Many of the victims have been rural union leaders involved in land disputes and church activists who advise them. In only three cases, two involving the murder of priests, have the killers been brought to justice, according to <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, the human rights group. The most famous case involved the slaying of <PERSON> Chico </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendes </PERSON>, a world-renowned union leader and environmentalist who led peaceful protests to stop the clearing of <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> rain forest by cattle ranchers. <PERSON> Mendes </PERSON>, 44, was shot in his home in the backwoods <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Xapuri </LOCATION> on Dec. 22, 1988. Although a cattle rancher and his son have been arrested and charged in the case, a judge last week announced that the earliest possible trial date would be April 1990.

 Plumbers worked overtime across the South on Wednesday to repair thousands of water pipes that burst when they froze in record low temperatures, and frozen waterways are slowing shipping and devastating some commercial fishing. Temperatures have eased since record lows late last week and during the Christmas holiday weekend, with temperatures in the 40s and 50s Wednesday in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. Homeowners and plumbers in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> were working as fast as they could to repair thousands of pipes broken during three days of record-setting lows. `` We're so busy I ca n't believe it,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Rumsey </PERSON>, general superintendent at Crown Plumbing. `` We're trying to hold the men's working days down to 12 hours, but some of them are getting 15 or 16 hours.'' <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> officials said that by midday Wednesday, water pressure in the city was up to 80 percent as leaks were gradually plugged. Residents of some <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> apartment complexes had been without water since Friday. `` They're dipping water from the pool and carrying it to their apartments to flush their toilets,'' said <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, manager of Regency Arms apartments. In <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, Mayor <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> <PERSON> Ditto </PERSON> said it was impossible to say when the city's water problems might be over. Ditto said crews working to restore service to the remainder of 60,000 homes and businesses that had been without water were still finding new problems. He said there were 33 breaks in <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 900 miles of water lines Wednesday morning, up from 10 the night before. Non-essential federal, state, county and city government workers stayed off the job in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>. `` Our guys are working'til they drop. I do n't know how much longer they can keep up this pace,'' said <PERSON> Bennie </PERSON> <PERSON> Payne </PERSON>, owner of Central Plumb It Yourself Supply in <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, which also sends plumbers on house calls. The 50,000 residents of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>' public housing projects have had little or no water. City officials said water pressure dropped from a normal 65 pounds per square inch to about 47 because of pipe breaks. The <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> freeze, called the harshest of this century by meteorologists, sent temperatures below 32 degrees for almost 82 hours in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> and below 15 degrees for 15 hours. While water pressure plunged, the economic pressures of the freeze pushed produce prices higher at the wholesale level. Prices were expected to climb soon in supermarkets as well, experts said Wednesday. `` The pipeline stays filled for three to seven days in advance of any major prices change in the marketplace,'' said <PERSON> Reggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vegetable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>. `` You'll start seeing it showing up probably within a week.'' Heating oil prices continued to climb as well. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, the cost per gallon of home heating oil hit a record high $ 1.37, up from 81 cents on Oct. 5, <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Osgood </PERSON>, director of the Governor's <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday. The previous high was $ 1.29 in March 1981. The freeze ravaged the citrus industry in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Plaquemines </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parish </LOCATION> for the second time since 1983 Unlike growers in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> orchard owners got most of the fruit picked before the freeze, but the trees were damaged. `` It's a disaster second only to a big hurricane,'' said <PERSON> Luke </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrovich </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Plaquemines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. `` We've lost our entire citrus industry, all our truck farms are wiped out, and the fishing industry will be hit real hard. `` Not only are there thousands of frozen fish in the marshes, but we also have oysters frozen in their shells. The seafood has been totally spoiled, ruined,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Buras </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fishermen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plaquemines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parish </ORGANIZATION>. In the East, this is turning out to be the iciest winter on <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, with foot-thick ice in places, since the winter of 1976-77 when much of the estuary froze. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> has been hampered in its efforts to clear shipping lanes because of the four ships it used for ice-breaking are in for repairs, said Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldmann </PERSON>. Farther north, up to a half-foot of ice on <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>'s three rivers has brought barge and boat traffic to a virtual standstill. Ice covers 70 percent to 100 percent of the <LOCATION> Allegheny </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Monongahela </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> rivers. `` The river people I talk to are saying this is the worst they've seen since the winter of 1977-78,'' said Coast Guard Cmdr. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Regalbuto </PERSON>.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> assured the folks back home Wednesday that his wife is `` in very good health,'' notwithstanding what the they may have read in a supermarket tabloid. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, addressing more than 800 people at a barbeque dinner in his home state, said he left Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> back at the White House `` winding down her responsibilities as a grandparent'' over the Christmas holidays. `` She is in good health. I get asked that all the time,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> about his wife of 44 years who has been undergoing treatment for Graves disease. Graves disease is the result of an overactive thyroid gland and has caused teary eyes and double vision in Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, according to her doctors. The National Enquirer recently ran an article claiming her condition was worse than the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> has let on and that the first lady was in severe pain at times. The White House says Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is responding to treatment. She visited the Mayo Clinic in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, last month, where specialists decided to vary her medication, prednisone. `` You know, there is a magazine that I'm sure nobody here is too familiar with called the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enquirer </ORGANIZATION>. But apparently they printed a story about her on their front page and we've had more crazy letters and inquiries'' about her health, said the president. `` She's in very good health. She feels just great,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will join her husband on Friday in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, where they will ring in the new year. They also plan to visit soldiers wounded in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> at two military hospitals in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> on Sunday. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is spending three days in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> without his wife, hunting for quail at the ranch of a friend, <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Farish </PERSON>, as he has during Christmas week for years. The crowd gave a vigorous round of applause when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> concluded his remarks on his wife's health by saying, `` I think Bar's doing a fantastic job for our country.' The Bushes celebrated Christmas with their five children and 11 grandchildren at Camp David, the presidential retreat in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> agreed to restore diplomatic relations Wednesday after a 12-year rift caused by the late Egyptian President <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>'s peace negotiations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. A summit between presidents <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> will take place in early January, the prime ministers of both countries announced. Syrian Prime Minister <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Zoubi </PERSON> said restoring ties `` will open a new page in the history of our common destiny.'' The accord was announced at the end of a one-day visit to <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> by Prime Minister <PERSON> Atef </PERSON> <PERSON> Sedki </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. At a news conference, <PERSON> Sedki </PERSON> and <PERSON> Zoubi </PERSON> said they agreed to exchange ambassadors. They gave no date for the January summit. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials said the development could improve <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s peace prospects with the Arab world. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> is the only Arab nation with which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has a peace treaty, and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has been an implacable foe. A statement released in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> said: `` The governments of the <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> have agreed to resume full diplomatic relations, effective Wednesday, Dec. 27, 1989. This comes to express the determination of the two peoples to consolidate brotherly relations in all fields.'' The announcement said changes worldwide made both countries realize the `` necessity of achieving comprehensive Arab entente as a sound basis for joint Arab action.'' <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> were united in 1958 under a pan-Arabic movement led by <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>'s predecessor, <PERSON> Gamal </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON>. They resumed independent governments in 1961. <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> broke ties after <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> made a dramatic visit to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> in 1977, the opening move in two years of negotiations that resulted in the <LOCATION> Egypt-Israel </LOCATION> peace accord. <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON>, aide to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, characterized Wednesday's agreement as `` part of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s going back to the Arab world'' after its ostracism. `` We hope it will bring about a bigger realization in the Arab world that peace with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is possible and desirable,'' he told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. However, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> did not see the agreement as `` signifying any change in the <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> position regarding <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> or peace.'' <PERSON> Sedki </PERSON>, the first such high-ranking Egyptian official to visit the Syrian capital since the rift, met for two hours with <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> before the announcement. He said the results of the meeting were `` even more than I originally expected. `` President <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> talked very warmly about <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and recalled all the past and historic ties between the two countries. He further qualified the period of complications as an experience we should profit from.'' <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> radio said <PERSON> Sedki </PERSON> carried a message to <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> from <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>. He did not disclose its contents. `` The purpose of this trip is to take the last step, following which comes the resumption of ties,'' <PERSON> Sedki </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s goal is to unify ranks with <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and consolidate cooperation between our two countries.'' In a brief statement to reporters, <PERSON> Zoubi </PERSON> said developments `` witnessed by the Arab world require that <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> return to each other on the basis of their historical and fraternal bonds.'' <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> said Tuesday that he and <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> planned to meet, but indicated this would follow restoration of diplomatic links. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> said his policy was never to allow improvement of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s relations with any country to affect ties with another nation. This appeared aimed at both <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, ruled by rival wings of the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baath </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and at odds for years. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> aided <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> militarily in its eight-year war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> backed <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Seventeen Arab states severed relations with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> after the Camp David peace accords with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1979. All except <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> now have restored diplomatic ties with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Wednesday he is determined to bring to justice <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> `` for poisoning the children of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>'' with drugs, but he conceded that the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s refusal to give up thedeposed Panamanian dictator does `` complicate things.'' In a speech before a crowd of more than 800 at a barbeque dinner in <LOCATION> Beeville </LOCATION>, near one of his favorite South Texcas hunting haunts, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> drew loud applause both when he promised to press to bring <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to trial and to avoid `` hellacious cuts'' in the defense budget. `` I am determined to bring him to justice. We have to work with our friends in the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. We have to certainly work with respect with the new <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> government in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` But I want to see this man who is under indictment brought to justice for poisoning the children of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'' with drugs. A senior official who spoke on condition that he not be identified said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that officials believe the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> has not yet defined its position, and thus a resolution is not close. But this official said the administration expects a solution sooner rather than later because it is in no one's interest _ not that of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> or the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> _ to allow the current state of affairs to drag on. Earlier, at a news conference upon landing in <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was putting `` no time limit'' on the quest to bring <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, now holed up in the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s embassy in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, to trial in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was indicted in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on federal drug trafficking charges in 1988. In his dinner remarks, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military operation in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> `` a superb effort'' and said it makes him determined to resist calls for deep cuts in defense spending. `` I believe we should keep a ready force that is able to defend American interests and American lives around the world,'' he said from a stage surrounded by bales of hay. A banner read: `` <LOCATION> Bee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> is Bush Quail Country.'' `` We're still going down the road of trying to get him sent here,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, starting a five-day hunting and fishing trip in his adopted homestate of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` We will continue to negotiate.'' He refused to criticize the Holy See, telling reporters `` we're not posturing ourselves as trying to be calling people to task'' and saying it was no time for `` name-calling. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appeared to leave open the possibility that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> could be tried in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. He said there was a threat of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> regaining power if he remained there `` unless he were in total custody and sentenced to the prison sentence he deserves.'' Answering questions at <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION>, where he took pilot training in 1943, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> exclaimed: `` <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> turning himself in was about as good a Christmas present as our soldiers, <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION>, airmen and the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people could want.'' He pronounced the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military intervention `` an amazingly well-coordinated, superbly executed operation.'' The president said he was n't worried about taking a vacation while <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops remained active in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` Why should I be? `` he asked. `` It's winding down.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> commenced his vacation as a <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON>, said there was no legal way its embassy in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> could hand over <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> made good on its Tuesday threat to seek a freeze on <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> bank accounts where <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is believed to have stashed millions of dollars in illegal drug profits. The president maintained Wednesday he had no concerns about <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> revealing U.S.-Panamanian intelligence secrets at a trial. He was referring to things <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> might reveal about his previous close relations with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, including the period in the 1970s when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director and <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was an intelligence source. `` I think that's history, and I think the main thing is he should be tried and brought to justice,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said at a brief news conference. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trial could result in `` some release of certain confidential documents that he may try to blindside the whole justice process.'' But, he added, `` The system works, so I would n't worry about that. Earlier, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters aboard <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> One that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> `` can talk about the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> until he's blue in the face. It wo n't hurt anything.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, asked whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would let <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> try <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, replied: `` That would require a lot of conversations because we do n't want to do anything that even implies undermining the sovereign power of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> or the fact the government is operating with the trust of the people.'' The president said he was personally involved in efforts to gain custody of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> from the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> embassy in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has been sheltered since Christmas Eve, but he had not contacted either the papal nuncio in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> or Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> II. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did say he planned to hold talks with Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, his longtime friend and hunting partner, while in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Asked about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demands that the embassy directly turn over <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities, the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> spokesman said there was no legal way that could be done. He said the embassy is empowered to deal only with the government of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and no other foreign government. On a related matter, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said it will take `` a lot of diplomatic effort and a lot of it on my part'' to repair relations with Latin countries offended by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. He said he thinks that once they see the democratically elected government in place, and they see that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is `` out of the picture _ none of them supported him at all; they found him outrageous _ then I think you begin to see the problem that might have been caused by a prolonged conflict down there.'' Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday asked authorities in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to halt transactions in bank accounts believed to hold $ 10 million <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> amassed through drug dealing. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> responded by freezing accounts in four banks. In another development, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s new government sent a high-level economic team to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for talks with officials from the State and <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> departments and other agencies about reviving that country's economy, blasted by months of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions against the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> regime. The assistant secretary for inter-American affairs, <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Aronson </PERSON>, said a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation will be sent to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> soon to continue the talks. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had some success in his fishing and hunting expedition Wednesday. The president, who was plagued by bad luck fishing at his home in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, last summer, caught three fish off <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and showed off a huge, 22-inch redfish to reporters to prove his claim. `` I wanted you to know we were n't lying,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Beeville </LOCATION>. His fishing companion, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, showed off part of his catch, a large trout. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> caught four or five fish to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s three White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> also bagged 10 quail between them in a morning shoot.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers on Wednesday blasted rock music and the latest <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> news bulletins at the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> embassy where Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is shuttered, as the stalemate over his fate continued. Both the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the new U.S-backed Panamanian government renewed their pleas Wednesday to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> to release the ousted dictator. `` We feel that the nunciature, the papal nuncio should in the very near future ask the ex-dictator to leave,'' said President <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>. `` We believe that Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s crimes are not political. He is a common criminal of the worst kind.'' In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Wednesday he is determined to bring <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to justice `` for poisoning the children of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>'' with drugs, but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> conceded the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s refusal to give him up does `` complicate things.'' The diplomatic standoff went into its fourth day and <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s fate remained undetermined A <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> spokesman said he did not see how <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> could be released to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Among alternatives being discussed were transfer to a third country and a trial for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` He has been accused, justly accused, of homicides and narcotrafficking and very, very horrendous crimes,'' <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> said at a news conference. Also on Wednesday, the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> was returning to normal gradually, and a spokeswoman said waterway officials hoped to go to 24-hour operation to clear a 125-ship backup as more personnel returned to work. In <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, battered by days of fighting and looting, people were returning to work and lined up outside grocery stores that were not looted. The president of the <ORGANIZATION> Panamanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Maduro </PERSON>, put losses caused by looting between $ 750 million and $ 1 billion. At some gasoline stations, motorists were lowering buckets into below-ground storage tanks to fill up their cars. The pumps were destroyed at many stations by looters. In Colon, 50 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers confiscated a warehouse belonging to <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Duque </PERSON>, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s candidate for president in the annulled May elections A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldier who helped in the search said the drug-sniffing dog `` was running around in circles'' but the troops would n't say if drugs were found. On Wednesday, some of the 100 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops surrounding the <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> hooked up powerful loudspeakers in a nearby parking lot and played rock songs that included `` I Fought the Law,'' `` Voodoo Child'' and `` You're No Good.'' The music could be heard by reporters on the 12th floor of a nearby hotel. Throughout the afternoon, the olive-green loudspeakers were hooked up to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Southern Command radio. If <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was listening, he could have heard about negotiations over his status and that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> froze millions of dollars he allegedly stashed in overseas accounts. A technician who got out of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military communications van opened a telephone line box outside the walls of the embassy, but it could n't be determined if the lines were being fixed or tapped. The Americans also shot out all street lights with pellet guns and mowed tall grass outside the embassy compound. A <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> spokesman refused to say whether the actions might be for security or for harassment. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> fled to the embassy on Sunday, five days after a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion toppled his government and sent him into hiding. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops, armored cars and helicopters ring the embassy around the clock to ensure the toppled strongman does n't escape or get spirited away. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants to capture <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and bring him to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to face drug trafficking charges filed in 1988. In <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> reiterated Wednesday there is no legal way the Holy See can hand <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> over as there is no extradition treaty with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> added the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> is studying the case in its `` juridical, diplomatic and humanitarian, and therefore, ethical considerations.'' Without an agreement, it would be nearly impossible for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to get past the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops surrounding the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> mission. At the same time, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops can not go after <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> because embassies are inviolable under international law. Faced with the possibility <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> could be granted asylum in another country, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> filed papers Wednesday in four countries to freeze bank accounts in which <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is believed to have stashed more than $ 10 million in `` illegal drug money.'' <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, where one of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s daughters lives, have been mentioned as possible havens However, Dominican Foreign Minister <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> said Wednesday his country has an extradition treaty with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> could be extradited if he goes there. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appeared to leave open the possibility that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> could be tried in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. He said there was a threat of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> regaining power if he remained `` unless he were ... sentenced to the prison sentence he deserves.'' <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s constitution forbids extradition of Panamaniam nationals to another country but said a loophole might be provided by the 1904 treaty that allowed the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to build the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. Also Wednesday, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s election commission certified that <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> won a May 7 election nullified by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The commission said tallies collected by <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>'s coalition were enough to show his ticket winning with 62.5 percent of the vote. <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> was sworn in on Dec. 20, shortly after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion began. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military said it arrested most members of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, which numbered 15,000, and only a few hundred remained unaccounted for Among those reported arrested Wednesday was <PERSON> Vicky </PERSON> <PERSON> Amado </PERSON>, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s long-time mistress. <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday 23 Americans were killed and 322 wounded since the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> invaded. It said 297 Panamanians were killed and 123 wounded. Doctors say more than 100 civilians also died during the fighting. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON>, resigned and asked for asylum in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, a Panamanian Embassy employee said on condition of anonymity. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has not officially recognized the <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> government. `` I can not accept a government that was imposed under the machine guns of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> was quoted as saying by <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s Excelsior news service.

The Rev. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Reardon </PERSON> told mourners that his death `` shatters the superficial beauty of Christmastime.'' `` This is n't the Christmas that any one of us planned,'' <PERSON> Reardon </PERSON> said. `` We are grateful to him for the sacrifice he made. We value and appreciate all the honors and awards being given to him today.'' Gov. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> were among those at the ceremony. <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said he was `` here to honor someone who has fallen in the line of duty for his country, and to comfort his family.'' At <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agnes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, about 550 family, friends and sympathizers, including Roman Catholic Cardinal <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Law </PERSON>, mourned <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Lt. j.g. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Connors </PERSON>. <PERSON> Connors </PERSON>, a 25-year-old <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> native, had volunteered for service in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.

Law picked up on the theme of the search for meaning in <PERSON> Connors </PERSON>' death `` It is a senselessness,'' Law said. `` The senselessness of sin, and sin works itself out in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> and elsewhere.'' Among the mourners was the new <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Vallerino </PERSON>, who lives in the neighboring town of <LOCATION> Belmont </LOCATION>.

The complete works of <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> are headed for the pulping machine. `` Perhaps we'll keep one copy of each, somewhere,'' allowed <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Popescu </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradiceni </PERSON>, director since 1955, with a slight sniff. `` After all, we are a library.'' A trigger of the revolution was the looming presence of the dictator's numbing words, bound in bulk. They were stacked in the window of every bookstore. At the national library, they filled six long rows. Enthusiastic workmen have already carted off various translations of `` On the Way of Building up the <ORGANIZATION> Multilaterally </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Developed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>,'' all 32 volumes, 700 pages each. The English edition was baled to go. Had anyone ever checked out volume 26, for example, he would have learned: `` The visit I have paid to <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> at the invitation of President <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Siad </PERSON> <PERSON> Barre </PERSON> has yielded highly good results.'' The pile included leaflets of speeches, collected mental musings and 12-ounce publicity packets to the glory of a man who traveled the world ceaselessly to exchange fulsome toasts and pose for photos. One collection had almost identical covers. At the left, there was <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> with slicked down jet black hair and a debonaire mien, a photo from 1957. At the right, there was someone else: <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mengistu </LOCATION>, or whichever of his friends he happened to be visiting. But not all the purged books were his. There was also `` Research in the Field of Systems and Characteristics of Macromolecules'' by his wife, <PERSON> Elena </PERSON>. `` No one ever read this stuff, no one,'' said <PERSON> Virgil </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiberiu </PERSON> <PERSON> Spanu </PERSON>, director of acquisitions. `` Never.'' The couple was ousted from power Friday. They were reported executed Monday A new revolutionary council has promised free elections and democracy. At <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the Romanian Mission tossed out dozens of books by <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, cut the hammer and sickle from its flag, and dropped `` socialist'' from its name. Delegation member <PERSON> Dino </PERSON> <PERSON> Marian </PERSON> said Wednesday, `` I must confess there already was a thick layer of dust on the books.'' For the librarians, destroying <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s books was sweet revenge for bibliophiles forced to hide away 10 percent of their collection under lock and key. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s strict laws forbade anyone without a special permit to see books about Romanian politics since World War I, or works of anyone suspected to be even a mild dissident. Books by foreign radicals or <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economists also were restricted. Romanian and foreign researchers had to apply to a cultural council that decided whether to grant permission. Applications were referred to the secret police. `` When you applied to the council, a very secret, complex mechanism came into play,'' <PERSON> Spanu </PERSON> said. `` Most people did not bother.'' Some books were banned altogether. Mostly, books were not bought because the library had no foreign currency. `` We were 10 to 15 years behind the world in scientific material,'' <PERSON> Spanu </PERSON> said. The library's latest edition of the journal `` Chemical Abstracts'' is from 1972. But the problem went beyond money. In <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, each typewriter had to be registered with the police, along with a sample of its characters. At the news agency Agerpres, editors made a careful selection of what was truth for the general public, what would be passed along in a single copy and what would go nowhere at all. At the national library, directors are confident of a sharp shift. As one good omen, their collection survived the revolution. Although the nearby university library lost 500,000 books, burned in fighting between <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> loyalists and revolutionaries, all of the national library's 1.5 million volumes survived. `` We were lucky because we have no building of our own, and our books are in storage all over town,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bradiceni </PERSON> said. She looked around at at the shelves purged of <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s works. `` Now we have plenty of room.''

 Attorneys for <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> wanted to shield top executives from details of environmental problems at chemical plants to protect them from legal action, according to court papers filed in a lawsuit against the oil giant. The papers were filed in federal court here in a lawsuit against the nation's second largest oil company by <PERSON> Valcar </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Riverdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s former environmental affairs manager. <PERSON> Bowman </PERSON> claims he was fired in April 1986 because he refused to go along with a cover-up of pollution problems. <PERSON> Bowman </PERSON> had been the division's second ranking environmental official. The court papers also quote a memorandum by a company lawyer as saying attorney-client privilege can be used to keep documents out of the hands of government agencies. The papers shed new light on wording changes sought by <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> lawyers in confidential reports about environmental conditions at plants nationwide. Those reports, filed with the court, remain sealed. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> unsealed them Friday but delayed his order when <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> said it would appeal. The company denies covering up pollution problems, argues that the changes were minor and and contends that <PERSON> Bowman </PERSON> was fired in an economic cutback. <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> ruled Dec. 11 that enough evidence existed for the case to go to trial, denying <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION>'s summary judgment motion. Briefs submitted by both sides for the motion were released this week and contain the disclosures. <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s then-environmental counsel, <PERSON> Winfred </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Colbert </PERSON>, `` voiced concern'' in a 1985 memorandum about the company's `` longstanding practice'' of distributing the environmental reports to upper-level management, according to a brief by <PERSON> Bowman </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiley </PERSON>. The memo concerns a report about the company's <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, plant. `` I note that the report contains several admissions of non-compliance, which in some cases are unavoidable,'' the memo read. `` The principal concern I have in this regard relates to the potential liability which can attach to all managers who receive the report.'' <PERSON> Colbert </PERSON> said only plant managers, <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> environmental officials and lawyers should see whole reports. Others would receive summaries on a `` need-to-know basis.'' `` This revised procedure will properly focus direct responsibility for necessary actions at the plant level and minimize the potential exposure of higher level management,'' the brief quoted <PERSON> Colbert </PERSON> as writing. `` What <PERSON> Colbert </PERSON> said there, I think, is general lawyering,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, denying it was company policy. <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s president, <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Biggs </PERSON>, wrote a letter at about the same time that required line managers to report `` significant'' environmental problems to him, said the division's general counsel, <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Neill </PERSON> <PERSON> Colbert </PERSON> `` was n't trying to shield anybody from liability,'' <PERSON> Neill </PERSON> said, but was only making sure that responsibility for plant operations was properly delegated. <PERSON> Bowman </PERSON> also charges that <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> removed records from its <LOCATION> Bakersfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, plant, which was under scrutiny by environmental officials, to keep the records out of regulators' hands The records were given to an outside attorney, <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Straw </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, to `` cloak'' them in the attorney-client privilege, said <PERSON> Wiley </PERSON>'s brief. The brief cited a May 30, 1985, memo from another <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> lawyer, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindberg </PERSON>, to <PERSON> Bowman </PERSON> explaining that the attorney-client privilege `` is much broader and receives greater protection under the law than most of our company documents which are not protected by legal privilege. `` In fact, it would be more difficult for any governmental agency to obtain any of the information delivered to Mr. <PERSON> Straw </PERSON> than it would for them to obtain that information from <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> directly under a subpoena,'' <PERSON> Lindberg </PERSON> wrote. `` I'm not going to excuse what <PERSON> Lindberg </PERSON> said,'' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> commented, calling the statement another example of `` lawyering.'' He said all papers required by law to be at the <LOCATION> Bakersfield </LOCATION> plant never left there. Two or three boxes of documents were sent to <PERSON> Straw </PERSON>, but have never been subpoenaed, he said. As an example of alleged `` sanitizing'' of environmental reports by lawyers, <PERSON> Bowman </PERSON>'s brief refers to <PERSON> Colbert </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> memo. <PERSON> Colbert </PERSON> wanted the word `` fully'' placed before `` acquainted'' in the sentence, `` Plant personnel have not had time to become acquainted with'' Superfund reporting procedures, according to court papers. In a report about the <LOCATION> Frankfort </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, plant, <PERSON> Colbert </PERSON> added `` Records do not indicate that'' to the sentence, `` the plant is not consistently reporting excursions within five days of becoming aware of the incident.'' <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> says the second `` not'' was accidental and that the other two changes made the reports more accurate.

<HEAD>Former Employee Says Firm Covered Up Microchip Defects</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FULLERTON, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A former <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> engineer has filed a $ 9.6 billion lawsuit against the company charging that it concealed a potential defect in computer chips used in defense systems. The lawsuit was dismissed as mostly `` fantasy'' by a Hughes official. Metallurgist <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Denlinger </PERSON>, a former senior staff engineer at a <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> division here, filed the lawsuit in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION> last June, but it remained sealed until it was served on Tuesday. <PERSON> Denlinger </PERSON> claims that more than 4 million computer chips used in national defense systems may corrode because <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> took a shortcut in a soldering process that can cause cracks in what should be airtight surfaces. `` We think our national security is compromised,'' his attorney, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbaro </PERSON>, said Tuesday. <PERSON> Denlinger </PERSON>, who worked for <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> for 14 years and was most recently responsible for testing strengths of materials, brought the action under the federal False Claims Act, which allows whistleblowers to share in damage awards in defense fraud cases. Damages in false claims cases are usually triple the value of the products. <PERSON> Denlinger </PERSON>'s attorneys claim the company sold $ 3.2 billion worth of systems using the allegedly faulty computer chips. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> must decide whether to join such false claims lawsuits, which usually are sealed while the department investigates. The department told the federal court that its research of the <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> case was complete, and court papers indicated the department would make a decision on the case within 60 days. <PERSON> Denlinger </PERSON> alleges that defective chips installed since 1984 caused two failures in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s submarine-launched Advance Capability torpedo system. While routine screening found two defective chips in torpedoes, the lawsuit's allegations are wrong, said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Reeder </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>' Ground Systems Group in <LOCATION> Fullerton </LOCATION>. `` Most of the stuff is just fantasy,'' he said. `` We have never had any failure of the test torpedoes due to hardware problems during any of the hundreds of runs we have gone through.'' <PERSON> Denlinger </PERSON> said in the lawsuit that he repeatedly wrote memos about possible cracking of the chips but they were ignored. He resigned in November 1988. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said Tuesday that it has inspected every chip since becoming aware of a cracking problem in 1985, and said it was an industry-wide problem.

In <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, where the citrus industry is worth an estimated $ 3.5 billion a year, the Christmas cold wave struck with about 80 percent of the citrus crop still on the trees, and there was heavy icing of oranges and grapefruit. In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, an estimated 65 percent of the crop _ or $ 55 million worth wholesale _ was still on the trees, according to growers and farm officials.

<HEAD>Decade Unleashes Religious Right And East European Believers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 In religion, the decade of the 1980s started with a plunge into politics by <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s `` religious right'' and is ending with a burst of new freedoms for believers within the Soviet orbit. Over the past 10 years, the religion domain also has been jolted with scandals, hit with jail terms for `` sanctuary'' workers and shaken with conflicts over homosexuality, the Bible and abortion. Simultaneously the quest for <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> unity, though flagging from its earlier euphoria, nevertheless made substantial strides. So did closer Jewish-Christian relations, despite rocky moments. But the main religious hallmarks of the 80s were the burst into <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> political activism by church conservatives and the burgeoning of religious rights in lands long shackled under atheist statism. The freshening spiritual breath in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> emanated in part from the churches themselves and from that surprising Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Capping the trend was the unprecedented friendly meeting this year between <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> was scorned by previous Soviet leadership as impotent for lack of military power. But while religious opportunities grew in most Communist areas, even in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> despite the brutal anti-democracy suppression last summer, the churches met persistent harassment in Latin American. But they also became bastions of human rights there, although a long line of Christian workers were slain, particularly <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatamala </LOCATION>, along with thousands of civilians. The decade there began with the assassination of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s Roman Catholic Archbishop <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON> in 1980 and ended in 1989 with the murder of six Jesuit priests <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> churches entered a sanctuary movement to shelter refugees fleeing the strife-ridden area. But the formerly open movement edged underground after several participants were convicted in 1986 of smuggling aliens. A key religious development of the decade was the emergence into public affairs of the long insular religious right, which had previously denounced such activity as meddling in politics. But they surged from their spiritual closet in l980, along with their paragon, former President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, claiming credit for electing him that year and again in 1984. The changed mode was sparked by a suave <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> preacher, <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>, who founded Moral Majority in l979, and led it through 10 years of robust politicking, closing it down only this year. `` Mission accomplished,'' he said, adding that other conservative Christian lobbying groups had evolved to handle the cause. The movement's prime objectives _ public school prayer, tuition tax credits for church schools and stopping abortion _ remained unaccomplished. But ferment continued about them. A conservative tide also swept the Southern Baptist Convention, where fundamentalists gained the presidency in 1979 and held it through l989, broadening control throughout that biggest Protestant body. It was a battle for the Bible, fundamentalists contended, gradually imposing their demand for literalist `` biblical inerrancy'' _ historically and scientifically _ on denominational agencies. Meanwhile, mainline denominations suffered declines in membership, and their chief cooperative organization, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, fell into operational and financial disarray late in the decade. But remodeling work was underway, with efforts to bring more evangelical churches and Roman Catholicism into full membership. Also, quiet but steady progress continued on the ecumenical front. Northern and Southern Presbyterians, separated since the Civil War, united in 1983 into the Presbyterian Church -LRB- U.S.A -RRB- and three branches of Lutherans united in 1987 into the <ORGANIZATION> Evangelical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Of wider significance, a stream of world-wide, largely favorable responses flowed into the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION> to a remarkably inclusive `` convergence agreeement.'' Dealing with key issues dividing churches _ baptism, eucharist and ministry _ the `` BEM'' document was produced by representatives of Protestantism, Roman Catholicism and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orthodoxy </ORGANIZATION> at a l982 meeting in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>. The deepening ties were dramatized at a giant largely Baptist rally in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, where the pope preached on his 1987 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trip, flanked by leading figures of most <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> denominations. But he had a tense session with his <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hierarchy in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, where bishops told him Americans were used to being persuaded rather than told what to believe. But he insisted dissenters were' t good Seeking to tighten <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> controls, he stripped noted moral theologian <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> of teaching credentials in 1986 and temporarily curtailed the authority of <LOCATION> Seatle </LOCATION> Archbishop <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunthausen </PERSON>, restoring it in 1987. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s mid-decade repudiation of homosexualty as a `` moral disorder'' continued to stir sharp resentments and disruptions in Catholic churches. Sex scandals hit two prominent television evangelists, <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> resigned his <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> network in 1987 over a sexual tryst and in 1989 was convicted and imprisoned for defrauding contributors. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> was defrocked in 1988 for sexual misbehavior after he refused to to accept disciplines imposed by his denomination, the Assemblies of God.

<HEAD>Noriega: Cloistered Fugitive Picks Own Prison</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Temporarily, at least, <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> picked his own prison by taking refuge at the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> embassy in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> _ where Secretary of Defense <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> thinks the ousted military boss might be a long-term resident. That's not what the administration wants, but worse things could happen, and have. So long as the deposed military boss of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is a cloistered fugitive, he is isolated, silenced and confined to small compound, living in a spare, single room. Despite <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s sharp demands that the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> turn over <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stake to the right of embassy refuge seems more important than his case, so long as he is out of power and neutralized. American embassies sometimes have been havens for dissenters, notably in Cold War <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and now <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials argue that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> should not be granted asylum because he is a common criminal, not a political fugitive. In his case there is solid evidence of it, but totalitarian governments have no difficulty constructing criminal charges against their dissenters. Chinese dissident <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON> and his wife took refuge in the American embassy in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> more than six months ago, after the government crushed the democracy movement and began a purge of its leaders. He's still there, despite repeated protests from the Chinese, who say the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is interfering in their internal affairs. For 15 years, Cardinal <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Mindszenty </PERSON> lived in asylum in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>. He had been freed from a Communist prison in the Hungarian uprising of 1956, and took refuge at the embassy after the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> put down that rebellion. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> finally was able to arrange his release to the West in 1971. Embassies are considered to be the territory of the nations they represent, and when they choose to grant haven, even the most dictatorial of regimes have accepted it. Now, as <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said, lawyers and diplomats are trying to figure out what happens next in the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> case. He left open the possibility that it could be nothing. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said Tuesday that the embassy is surrounded, with no way out for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and no way in for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities. `` It could be that they'll have a long-term resident in their embassy in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> would hardly seem a welcome guest; church leaders including Monsignor <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sebastian </PERSON> <PERSON> Laboa </PERSON>, the papal nuncio in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, had long been critics of the general's regime. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> embassy had been a refuge for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> opponents when they needed one. Unless there is a deal to let <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> go to exile rather than to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trial, the ousted dictator can keep hiding, but he ca n't run. `` At present, if he leaves the embassy under any circumstances, he will in fact be arrested by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces and returned to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said Tuesday. Embassy refuge does not apply outside an embassy compound, so as soon as <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> stepped outside guarded <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> mission, he could be seized. The way around that would be a diplomatic deal to let him go into exile. It would have to be distant and silent, lest he regain his voice and try to incite his supporters against the new government. For all the demands that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> go on drug trial, the administration had been willing as recently as October to let him go into exile without prosecution if he yielded power. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> has no extradition agreement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> so if the church decided <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> should be expelled from the diplomatic mission, it would be to the custody of the Panamanian government. The Panamanian constitution forbids the extradition of any citizen. <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, the new president installed with <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> protection after <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was ousted, said if his government had custody, he could not deliver the dictator for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug trial. The fledgling <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> government, apparent winner of the May elections <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> annulled, needs to establish itself and display a power to govern independent of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Yielding up <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> would be counterproductive. But the <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> government could put him on trial as a killer; there have been <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hints that prosecution in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> might be acceptable. Until and unless the diplomats find a solution, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> presumably stays put, a captive in spare surroundings that mock the luxuries of his days in power, the cash, cocaine and voodoo cults said to have been his lifestyle.

<TEXT>
 It's an accomplishment when a writer can get even one television series going, but <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Hargrove </PERSON> has two hits on the air and next week launches two more shows. `` Father Dowling Mysteries,'' previously on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, makes its debut on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> next Thursday. `` <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>: Loose Cannon'' premieres on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> on Friday. <PERSON> Hargrove </PERSON> also created <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Matlock'' and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> and the Fatman.'' Earlier, he also developed the very successful series of `` Perry Mason'' movies for <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. His frequent collaborator is <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON>. `` Everybody has a theory about why a show is successful,'' said <PERSON> Hargrove </PERSON>. `` I think the audience basically is attracted by characters, and when you have that perfect wedding of character and performer you have a success. `` Most successful TV series are identified by a name: <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Archie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON>, Columbo, <PERSON> J.R </PERSON>. Even with shows like ` thirtysomething' or ` <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION> Law,' I think people tune in for the characters Basically, I tailor shows for the stars, like <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosley </PERSON>.'' `` Loose Cannon'' stars <PERSON> Shadoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> as <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>, a police detective whose wild and unconventional tactics have earned him the nickname of Loose Cannon. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> is a rock' n' roll disc jockey who is host of `` American Top 40'' and a panelist on `` Hollywood Squares.'' `` It's a new kind of show for us,'' said <PERSON> Hargrove </PERSON>, whose partner is <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON>, former president of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and former head of programming at <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. `` The series we've done so far have been traditional, middle of the road series. `` Working with <PERSON> Shadoe </PERSON> gives us an opportunity to design a show that's offbeat and contemporary. It has a strong vein of humor. I think almost all successful shows have had humor. I got my start as a comedy writer and I still think of myself as a comedy writer.'' `` Father Dowling'' stars <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> as two ecclesiastical snoops. He's the good father, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Dowling </PERSON>, and she's Sister <PERSON> Steve </PERSON>. Father <PERSON> Dowling </PERSON> is always running afoul of church hierarchy in the person of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> as <PERSON> Father </PERSON> <PERSON> Prestwick </PERSON>, the bishop's aide. The show's set in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, but like `` <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>,'' it's filmed in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. The next `` <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>'' movie, however, has been filmed in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. It's the 14th in the series since <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON> sold the project to <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. `` Fred talked to <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Burr </PERSON>, got the rights and got <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> interested,'' <PERSON> Hargrove </PERSON> said. `` He asked me to write the script. We thought it would be a good idea to bring in a younger character, so we cast <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Katt </PERSON> as <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>'s investigator. `` My notion was to put a detective story in the middle of ` <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>.' The detective gets an assignment early and goes off to pursue it. <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> carries on his mystery-solving, and the detective works on solving another element of the case. <PERSON> Katt </PERSON> has left, but we use the same technique with <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Moses </PERSON>.'' In the show set in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> defends an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> officer in a court-martial. <PERSON> Hargrove </PERSON> grew up in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and began writing student films while in college. He attended the <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> as a graduate student, but dropped out to write professionally. His first job was writing for `` The <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Newhart </PERSON> Show,'' <PERSON> Newhart </PERSON>'s first series on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> in 1961-63. `` <PERSON> Newhart </PERSON> was the button-down mind just out of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` We wrote a lot of telephone routines for him. <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Kibbe </PERSON> hired me and we later worked together on ` Columbo' and ` <PERSON> Madigan </PERSON>.' I also wrote for ` The Man From U.N.C.L.E.' because they wanted to bring a sense of humor to the show.'' <PERSON> Hargrove </PERSON> wrote the pilot for `` The Girl From U.N.C.L.E'' and was story consultant for `` It Takes a Thief.'' He wrote and produced <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>'s segments on `` Name of the Game.''

<HEAD>Zorro Rides Again</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When the New Year arrives, so will a gallant masked figure from the past of old <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. With sword flashing, black cape billowing, white teeth gleaming, here comes ... Zorro? Yes, by neddies. Zorro. With a Z. It's the latest in a long line of Zorros that includes the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> series of 1957-59 that set millions of tykes to running about in Zorro costumes, trying to puncture each other in the name of justice. That one starred <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. This one, starring <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> <PERSON> Regehr </PERSON>, 36, is the first new `` Zorro'' series ever on cable, specifically the Family Channel, where the half-hour series will debut on Jan. 5. The show's star, a Canadian with Shakespearean stage credits, is a very big Zorro. He stands 6 feet 5 inches tall and weighs 215 pounds. Were this a `` Zorro'' of fistics, not fencing, he'd be right at home. This is because <PERSON> Regehr </PERSON>, a soft-spoken man with a dry sense of humor, regularly used to put his dukes for sport. He once thought of seeking a spot on <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s Olympic boxing team. He fought 65 amateur bouts, he says, and had only three losses, none of them by knockouts. It did enter his mind that a flattened nose might be bad for someone seeking work as the handsome leading man in a work by <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>. `` That's why it was kind of dumb idea, do n't you think?'' he wryly asks. But that was when he was in his late teens, when the notion that he could get his face rearranged had not quite sunk in: `` No, at that age I think I was so stupid and cocky that I figured it would n't happen to me. `` And fortunately I got out before it did. I hope.'' <PERSON> Regehr </PERSON>'s dossier includes such varied work as `` Hamlet'' at <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Stratford </LOCATION> Shakespeare Festival and the role of the late <PERSON> Erroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> in <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` My Wicked, Wicked Ways.'' He shot 25 `` Zorro'' episodes in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> this fall. The new series takes place, as have most ` Zorro'' films, in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in 1820. <PERSON> Regehr </PERSON> has, as have others before him, a two-role part _ the dandy <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Vega </PERSON> who really is the masked <PERSON> Senor </PERSON> <PERSON> Zorro </PERSON> who zips about righting wrongs and leaving his trademark `` Z'' carved in various places. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> played things for laughs _ and with a gay look-alike brother _ in 1981's `` Zorro, The Gay Blade.'' So did CBS in 1983 with a contemporary `` Zorro and Son,'' which was the sort of show in which a Franciscan monk was arrested for `` selling wine before its time.'' But in this edition, done in the old romantic tradition, <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Diego </PERSON>, usually played as a popinjay or even a fop, does n't get that treatment from Regehr: `` I've played hm more like a Renaissance man, interested in art, science and music, more bookish rather than being, er, a little light on the feet.'' The actor, the son of an artist and a painter himself, has lived for the past ten years in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. But he and his wife, <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON>, have a New Year's project _ to move to <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. He would keep a place in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and commute there for film and TV work, he says. But he no longer wants to call it home. `` I did sort of like it 10 years ago, when it was n't as crowded or smog-filled,'' he says. Not now. And he has found that there is such a thing as too much mellow, of which there is said to be a lot in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>. In the old days, <PERSON> Regehr </PERSON> says, `` I could deal with the people there, the ` laid-backness.' Now, I do n't know. It just seems too relaxed to me.'' __ Elsewhere in television: NO NEW YEAR'S EVE WHOOPEE ON NBC _ On Dec. 31, a night many viewers are in funny hats, blowing horns and throwing confetti in the air, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> is airing a one-hour news special, `` <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s Ghost,'' at 10 p.m. EST. It's about the legacy of death and repression by the late Soviet leader, and the Stalinists who seek to turn back the reforms and liberalization of the <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> era. It is possible the show's ratings wo n't be very big.

<HEAD>Tough Choices For Income-Minded Savers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The financial menu looks pretty skimpy as income-conscious investors consider where to put their money for a new year and a new decade. No matter how far in time you are willing to extend yourself, alluring returns on certificates of deposit, bonds and other interest-bearing investments are hard to find these days. Certainly, you are unlikely to come across anything now that matches the two-digit yields on low-risk securities that were so commonly available in the early 1980s. But inflation has also declined in recent years, and so has the maximum rate at which the federal government taxes most people's interest income So, in the view of many analysts, the `` real'' returns offered now are n't as stingy as they might look. Suppose as 1990 begins that you can get a yield of 8.3 percent from a CD or money-market mutual fund. If your income tax bracket is 28 percent _ the top rate that applies to most savers and investors _ you have a return of 6 percent left over after Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> takes his cut. After taking into account consumer inflation in the 4 percent to 5 percent annual range, you still emerge with a positive return. On paper at least, that beats the results you might have achieved at a nominal interest rate of, say, 13 percent a decade ago, when inflation and taxes together would have left you actually in the red. Of course the current returns savers and investors can get are only part of the story. The ideal investment choice also must keep looking good through the future ups and downs of inflation and interest rates. Right now, many analysts are predicting at least a modest decline in interest rates over the next several months. That would argue in favor of longer-term investments such as CDs or bonds rather than short-term options such as money market funds. Unfortunately, interest rates at present are such that you get paid little or nothing for making that kind of longer-term commitment. A recent tally by the Bank Rate Monitor showed three-month CDs yielding an average of 7.87 percent; two-year CDs 7.71 percent, and five-year CDs 7.73 percent. This is known in financial circles as a flat, or slightly `` inverted,'' yield curve, and it is abnormal although by no means unprecedented in modern history. The yield curve has been out of kilter for more than a year now. But some analysts think it is slowly beginning to resume a more orthodox shape. For now the Value Line Investment Survey, the nation's largest independent investment advisory service, recommends keeping your options open by sticking mainly with short-term commitments. `` A bit more patience,'' the firm urges, `` a wait until the long rate offers more of a yield advantage to warrant the added risk.'' Staying short-term, of course, also gives you protection should interest rates pull a surprise by heading higher. In that event, yields on vehicles such as money market funds would stand to move up as well. What if interest rates should neither rise nor fall, but hover around present levels for some indeterminate period? That would create few opportunities for investors to pull off heroic coups of market timing. But it would leave enough goodies to go around that hardly anyone need be entirely dissatisfied. `` The sideways scenario is n't bad for either camp,'' observed <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON>, economist at the Wall Street firm of <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. `` The bulls earn the coupon -LRB- or nominal interest rate on long-term investments -RRB-, and since the yield curve is flat, the bears earn a comparable return in the short-term money markets.''

<TEXT>
 The fury of Romanians against their former government is revealed partly by the economic statistics. <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, in recent years, has been the economic backwater of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Alone among those nations _ <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> _ the country's gross national product and industrial production declined in 1988. Its GNP last year, in fact, was about where it was in 1980, while almost every other developed nation, communist and non-communist, registered increases. In that time <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> more than doubled its GNP. While <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s neighbors increased exports between 1980 and 1986, its exports stagnated. <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s population of 23 million is exceeded only by that of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, but <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s imports were lower than any fraternal East Bloc country. Its per capita gross national product of $ 5,500 also remains the lowest in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, less than one-half that of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and it is falling. Whereas East Germans had an automobile-to-population ratio of one to five, in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> the ratio was just a bit more than one in 100. While Romanian meat production averaged 70 kilograms per capita, that of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> was 160. In effect, the old government was leading the nation into economic decline and lower living standards at a time when growth, if perhaps slowly, was the rule in every other European country, possibly excluding tiny <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION>. The profile of economic deterioration amid growth emerges from research completed in August and published in September by the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. It shows a vivid contrast between communist and capitalist nations. The figures also suggest the urgent need of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to renovate and spur its own economy, in which growth rates have steadily deteriorated in recent years. The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> research shows Soviet GNP falling from average annual growth of 4.8 percent in 1961-65 and 4.9 percent from 1966-70, to 3.1 percent in 1971-75, 2.1 percent in 1976-80 and 1.9 percent in 1981-85. After a 4 percent spurt in 1986, mainly the result of a 10.3 percent surge in agricultural production, the GNP growth rate subsided to 1.3 percent in 1987 and 1.5 percent in 1988. Agricultural production shrank in the latter years. Reviewing the numbers, and contrasting them with those of the capitalist world, it's clear that the economies of the communist countries as a whole were becoming outmatched. In 1988, the annual rate of GNP growth in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and all countries of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> excepted, exceeded that of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the Soviet bloc nations of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Even the economies of the less developed countries, taken as a whole, showed a growth rate of 3.7 percent, or higher than the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the Communists nations of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Among the large communist nations, a swiftly industrializing <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> stands out, registering a growth rate of 11.2 percent in 1988, the third time since 1983 in which it has reached double-digit levels. The stark contrast between the communist and non-communist nations that emerges from the data emphasizes the economic origins of the upheavals. In an age of developing communications, that contrast was obvious to all, except perhaps for a few leaders.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Picked Top `Religion Newsmaker' Of 1989</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Although he ostensibly is not a religious man, Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is the top `` religion newsmaker'' of 1989, according to specialists in reporting that field. A poll of members of the <ORGANIZATION> Religion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newswriters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> made that choice, and also picked the extraordinary meeting of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> as the No. 1 religion news story of the year. It was the first meeting ever between a pope and leader of a government that for decades has upheld atheism and spurned religion, shackling it. But <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, baptized as an infant but a committed Communist, broke the pattern. `` We need spiritual values,'' he told the pope. The meeting presaged diplomatic relations between the two, long antagonistic leaderships, cleared the way for a possible papal visit to the <ORGANIZATION> USSR </ORGANIZATION> and brought assurances from <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> of broadened religious freedoms. Those expanding religious freedoms already were proliferating in the Soviet orbit _ in the swift shift toward democracy in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> _ in what some hailed as a triumph of faith over Marxism. That tide, and the fading of restrictions on religion in that area, even ahead of revised statutes, was picked by religion news specialists as 1989's third ranked religion story. `` A lot of that reform movement was fueled by the churches,'' said religion reporter <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorkelson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> who compiled the survey results. `` By and large, that aspect has n't been told.'' The second-ranked religion story was the trial, conviction and sentencing of television evangelist <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> to 45 years in prison and $ 500,000 in fines for defrauding contributors. He had quit his network in 1987 in a sex scandal. Other religion events ranked in this order: Fourth _ The murder of six Roman Catholic priests and jailing and torture of other church workers in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, sparking new demands by religious groups for an end to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to that nation. Fifth _ Worldwide controvery over publication of <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s `` The Satanic Verses,'' which Islamic zealots called blasphemous and degrading to the prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>. Iranian death threats sent <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> into hiding. Sixth _ Election by the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> diocese of the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barbara </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clementine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION>, 55, as suffragan bishop, the first woman to become a bishop in the worldwide Anglican communion. Seventh _ A warning by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops to politicians against taking pro-choice stands on abortion. <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> <PERSON> Killea </PERSON>, running for the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, did so and was barred from Holy Communion by <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>'s Bishop <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Maher </PERSON>. She won. Eighth _ The Rev. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Augustus </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> priest, was suspended after he formed his own <PERSON> African-American </PERSON> congregation in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, calling Catholicism racist. Ninth _ The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> backed relocation of a Carmelite convent from the <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> death camp after Polish Cardinal <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON> outraged Jews and some Catholic prelates with his comments about Jews in the controversy. Tenth _ Religious leaders condemned suppression of a student democracy movement in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and the <PERSON> Dalia </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, exiled Tibetan <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> leader, receives the Nobel Peace Prize in a move to point up the brutal crackdown. Besides picking the top-rated religion stories, religion reporters singled out incidents that tended to cover up religious affairs and stifle the public's right to know. Cited for first place in this `` Into the Darkness Award'' was the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION>, who went into closed session for an entire afternoon at their Novermber meeting and refused to disclose even their topic. Second place went to the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> at which newly predominant fundamentalist trustees of denominational agencies summoned executives behind closed doors to lay down tightened rules. Other `` darkness'' citations went to Episcopal bishops, who barred reporters from small-group discussions about women bishops, and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION>, which refused to divulge vote totals in election of the denomination's new president in which a white won over a black. Church officials said people simply should take their word on the outcome.

 <PERSON> Brahms </PERSON> loved <PERSON> Buffalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bill </PERSON>'s Wild West shows when they played in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> and so, presumes conductor <PERSON> Zubin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mehta </PERSON>, did <PERSON> Johann </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> Sr.. At any rate, <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> composed `` Indian Maidens Galop'' and <PERSON> Mehta </PERSON> will conduct the work with the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> Philharmonic on New Year's Day `` From <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>: the New Year's Celebration 1990,'' <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>'s traditional New Year's concert of effervescent <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> music, will be televised on Jan. 1 at 2:30 p.m. EST by PBS `` There is such an output by the <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> family, taking <PERSON> Johann </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and Sr., cousins and uncles, we can go on for 10 years of concerts without repeating a single piece,'' said <PERSON> Mehta </PERSON>, who was born in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. However `` The Blue Danube Waltz'' and `` Radetzky March'' will be repeated. They're played every year. `` The accent is on <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> in this year's program,'' said <PERSON> Mehta </PERSON>, who has never conducted a New Year's concert in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. `` I'm doing an overture, by <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Suppe </PERSON>, to ` Morning, Noon and Night in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>.''' Also on the program is <PERSON> Mehta </PERSON>'s favorite by <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, `` <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> Blood,'' which he has often presented as an encore when he conducted the <PERSON> Vienna </PERSON> <PERSON> Philharmonic </PERSON>. `` They used to ask the music director of the opera to do it. They have come to another sort of a plan now; each year they want to ask another one of their regular conductors to take over. Next year will be somebody else.'' In an interview at his office in <PERSON> Avery </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mehta </PERSON> said he has watched the concert on TV in the past and will in the future. `` I think <PERSON> Johann </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> is as classical as <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON> is. The pieces are played too much and without the right style, which tends to diminish the quality of this music. When played in the right style, it is sheer pleasure. It is the kind of music, like <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON>, that one feels there's not an extra note. `` This music reflects an age before the turn of the century when <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> was the cultural center of the world. It's the height of the <LOCATION> Hapsburg </LOCATION> monarchy that it reflects.'' <PERSON> Mehta </PERSON>, 53-year-old artistic director of both the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philharmonic </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Philharmonic </LOCATION>, conducted the <ORGANIZATION> Vienna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philharmonic </ORGANIZATION> last year in <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> but has n't toured with it. `` I ca n't be music director to two orchestras and tour with a third one. That would n't be fair to any side.'' Last year, <PERSON> Mehta </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philharmonic </ORGANIZATION> that when his contract expires in 1991, he wo n't renew, even though he believes the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philharmonic </ORGANIZATION> is one of the greatest orchestras around today. `` I feel after 13 years of my contributions here, somebody else should take over now,'' he said. `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> takes its toll on your spirit. Nobody can work harder than I can. But 13 years of playing 20 programs a season takes its toll on your inner person. `` And one has to be honest with oneself and say, I like to be free. I'm going to do a lot but I'm going to do what I want. I'm planning my freedom I'm planning more free time and I'm also planning projects. The next person waiting to meet me now is the director of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lyric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opera </ORGANIZATION>. From 1993 I'll be doing a new Ring cycle in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>.'' He also plans to record more operas. The physical part of conducting does n't tire <PERSON> Mehta </PERSON>. `` It is that inexplicable love and drive that you have from within for the music that makes you supersede all these material discomforts.'' In <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION>, when he conducted `` Gotterdammerung,'' the fourth and last opera in <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>'s Ring cycle, he said, `` You come out of the pit after conducting two hours. The longest Mahler symphony is an hour and a half. You've got the second and third acts to look forward to. And I ca n't wait for the second act to begin! For me these <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> pauses are necessary because of stage changes and the singers have to rest. But I ca n't wait to go back.'' <PERSON> Mehta </PERSON> planned to fly to <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> the Wednesday before New Year's. `` This concert is carefully prepared,'' he said. `` Though it's music that comes out of their blood, there are four rehearsals and two previous concerts, one for the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, one for the public, to prepare for it.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and its old <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc allies roared out of the 1980s on an incredible wave of reform that shattered the very foundations of communism. They move now into the 1990s on an uncharted course of high hopes and deep concerns. One grim possibility came from Soviet journalist <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Kabakov </PERSON>, writing in the monthly magazine Art of Film: It is the mid-1990s and <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms have failed. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has splintered into warring cantons. Famine grips the land, and roaming gangs of thugs rule <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. His nightmare is no idle fancy for a people who have known revolution, civil war and famine in this century. Again there is widespread worry, disillusionment and lack of faith as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, 72 years old, staggers into a new decade. In <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s allies are still aglow over the contagious political reforms that toppled the region's last hardline leader, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, in the final days of the 1980s. But they are also girding for tough years ahead. `` Someone will have to tell Czechoslovaks they have to work harder and earn less,'' warns the Czechoslovak economist <PERSON> Dusan </PERSON> <PERSON> Triska </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, `` We can hardly point to a sub-branch and even a single production which is competitive on free international markets,'' says Premier <PERSON> Georgi </PERSON> <PERSON> Atanasov </PERSON>. A liberator of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> who has also freed his own people from decades of repression, the 58-year-old <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has failed to deliver more tangible goods at home. As the 1990s dawn, and with them the sixth year of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reign, there still are lines for soap, matches, even sausage so foul it's called `` doggy delight.'' Many items are n't available at all. Communists no longer talk about burying capitalists; they want to mimic them. `` Now we need your ideas. Now we need your lessons in managing,'' <PERSON> Vitaly </PERSON> <PERSON> Korotich </PERSON>, editor in chief of <ORGANIZATION> Ogonyok </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, told Americans recently. Marxism has n't adequately fed Soviets; soon <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION> will have a chance. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s first McDonald's opens in January. The 1990s pose history's greatest challenge for what was once labeled `` the Soviet bloc.'' Erstwhile truths now discredited, Old Guard leaders tossed in the trash bin of history, Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> want to become smoothly functioning components in the modern world economic order. But can they? Even in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, a pioneer in implementing free-market practices, managers still have little concept of profit-oriented thinking, competition and labor productivity `` where you pay those who work and fire those who do n't,'' says <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>. The specter of hard times looms everywhere: <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s government is proposing an austerity program foreseeing a 15 percent increase in consumer prices and a slash in state subsidies. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, which had <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s No. 6 economy before World War II, must undo 40 years of Communist under-investment and shoddy maintenance of industry. `` We will have to abolish many insufficient factories and gradually open to the international market,'' says economist <PERSON> Miroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Slouf </PERSON>, deputy mayor of <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. `` Any newly elected government will be unpopular within months.'' Inflation tops 600 percent in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, and Poles donate the family silver and money hidden under mattresses to a fund to help the nation. Economists in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, their desks piled high with dire forecasts, struggle to draft a reform blueprint that will encourage Western help. The coming austerity could have high political costs. Shorn of their legally guaranteed grip on power in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, Communists are now condemned to share power and even lose it. Their Bulgarian comrades, possibly the Romanians, and finally the Soviets, are fated to follow. Politicians more responsive to voter demands will bring even more unraveling in the old Soviet bloc. Communism, borne into <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> on the bayonets of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in World War II, already must compete with other creeds, like Solidarity-style trade unionism and Roman Catholicism in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. The Kremlin is sending signals it will brook virtually any style of reform, as long as its allies stay in the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact military alliance. The late Soviet dissident <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Amalric </PERSON> wrote a book, `` Will the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> Survive Until 1984?'' It has, but enters the 1990s riven by ethnic disputes that constitute the most violent menace both to unity and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s authority. This continent-sized land of more than 100 nationalities is being unraveled by demands of Azerbaijanis, Armenians, Georgians, Estonians, Latvians and others. In the 1990s <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> must placate those nationalities or see the multi-ethnic empire the <ORGANIZATION> Bolsheviks </ORGANIZATION> seized from the czars disintegrate. So far, the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts have largely failed. Using more traditional tactics _ repression _ would cost the Soviets much of the good will they have accumulated abroad in the <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> era. More than anything else, the next Soviet decade depends on one man, <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Sergeyevich </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the stocky son of a southern Russian peasant who is unquestionably one of the most gifted political operators of the century. He may not be able to realize his vision of a more modern, open, better working <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> at peace with the world. But it is impossible to imagine anyone else doing it. The last rock of Stalinist stability in the Soviet bloc was swept away by the reform tide on the eve of the 1990s, though not without bloody resistance. <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, 71, was driven from power by a mass uprising of Romanians enraged that his security forces had slain thousands of anti-government demonstrators. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Elena </PERSON>, were executed on Christmas Day. That revolt, which lasted less than a week, was the final act in a remarkable year that saw hardline leaders in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> ousted by popular pressure, street demonstrations and civic bravery. Still untouched, by all accounts, was <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION>, which long ago sealed itself up in a Stalinist mold apart from the world and now is more alone than ever in a churning sea of change. But a joke making the rounds in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> reflected a view of Poles that the liberalization process they began is inevitable for all. The joke goes: Q. How long does it take to overthrow communism? A. Ten years in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, 10 weeks in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, 10 days in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> ... and 10 seconds in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Advances in science and technology promise to make the 10 years that begin Jan. 1 a decade of unparalleled accomplishment. But damage to the atmosphere, accumulation of solid wastes, the spread of AIDS and other threats also make the 1990s a decade of potential peril. `` Human beings now have the power to control their own fate to a degree that they've never had before,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Cornish </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Future </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. Topping the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Future </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>'s list of challenges for the 1990s: environmental damage to the Earth's climate, land, water and atmosphere. Here, in capsules drawn from the reporting of <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> specialists, is a look at some major areas of human endeavor and concern for the coming decade:
</TEXT>
<NOTE>THE AIR ABOVE</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 The intertwined issues of air pollution, the ozone layer and the greenhouse effect will all be high on the environmental agenda in the 1990s. In smog-bound <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, authorities will try to change a way of life by starting to wean commuters off gasoline-powered automobiles. Other cities are likely to follow suit. Scientists, meanwhile, will train their instruments on the thinning ozone in the stratosphere, a layer that shields the Earth from ultraviolet rays, which can cause skin cancer. A human pollutant _ chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs _ is destroying the ozone. Governments are trying to reduce <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> releases, but the question for the 1990s is whether it is too little too late. Scientists almost universally agree that carbon dioxide and other gases released into the atmosphere will produce the greenhouse effect _ letting sunlight in, but not letting <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s heat out But specialists disagree on when the warming will occur and how bad it will be. Pessimists predict the 1990s will be even warmer than the 1980s, one of the warmest recent decades.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>SOLID WASTE</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 Specialists see an upcoming crunch on the garbage front: Half the nation's 6,000 dumps will be filled and closed in the'90s. Said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Weddle </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s municipal solid waste program: `` By the end of the decade, I think recycling is going to be part of the cultural fabric of society. People will be separating out all bottles, cans, newspapers, plastics, leaves and grass clippings instead of throwing them in one can.'' Americans now bury about 80 percent of their waste in dumps, burn 10 percent and recycle the remainder. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> predicts recycling will jump to 25 percent by 1992.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>THE AIDS EPIDEMIC</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> estimates that nine times more people around the world will get AIDS in the 1990s than did in the 1980s. By the year 2000, there could be 6 million AIDS cases, and 18 million people could be infected. An estimated 1 million to 1.5 million Americans are now infected with the deadly disease. Most, perhaps all, will eventually become ill. Researchers can not confidently predict a vaccine or cure in the coming decade, but they believe AIDS could be subdued to the point of becoming a chronic disease, one for which those infected must take long-term medication.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>HEART DISEASE-CANCER</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 If current death rates continue, 13 million American lives will be claimed in the 1990s by two big killers _ heart disease and cancer. Medical researchers do not expect cures in the next decade. Instead, they look for new insights to help them attack the diseases from many directions. Better understanding of cancer-causing genes and how to block them, for example, and of cancer-suppressing genes and how to harness them, would give medical scientists crucial new weapons to wield against cancer. New discoveries about the relationship of diet to heart disease might lead to innovative treatments for the nation's leading killer.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>GENETICS</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 Biologists who have uncovered the genetic causes of such ailments as cystic fibrosis will turn their attention to the genetics of human behavior in the 1990s. In human genes, scientists may find the roots of such complex disorders as manic-depressive illness and schizophrenia. Specialists believe understanding of some behavioral disorders should come by the year 2000. `` I think this will be a tremendously exciting field in the next 10 years,'' says <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Baltimore </PERSON>, a Nobel laureate at the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>SPACE</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 After years of tight budgets, American scientists hope the 1990s will introduce a new `` golden age'' of space exploration. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has proposed a major commitment to completing the manned space station Freedom in the 1990s and to a permanent base on the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION> and a manned mission to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION> early in the next century. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> probe <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION>, launched from a space shuttle last May, is to orbit <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> next August. The probe <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION>, launched from a shuttle in October, is to orbit Jupiter in 1995. En route, <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> will also study <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> and take the first closeup look at an asteroid. In 1992, the Mars Observer will be launched, to orbit the red planet for a multi-year examination. The Soviets, meanwhile, will continue development of a space shuttle and exploit their own space station Mir, as they pursue their stated goal of dispatching cosmonauts to Mars early in the 21st century.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>MASS TRANSPORT</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 Specialists foresee more automobiles on the road in the 1990s, on a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> highway system that will never keep pace. Experts say air pollution and possible oil shortages in the'90s will spur production of cleaner, higher-mileage cars; increased use of vehicles that run on methanol, natural gas, electricity or solar power; construction of more trolleys and other `` light rail'' systems, and more vacation travel done by trains, planes and cruise ships. Traffic management will include synchronized traffic lights, metered on-ramps, car-pool and bus lanes, reversible traffic lanes, staggered work hours, and limits on times trucks can move goods.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>COMPUTERS</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 The high technologists look ahead to a personal computer in the 1990s that will be a blend of 3-D television and quadraphonic stereo with the hand controls of a video game machine and more speed than car-sized mainframes of the 1980s. `` Multimedia'' computers will rival television for attention, able to surround the user with, for example, the sights and sounds of an early morning in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> or an erupting Hawaiian volcano. Experts say they will help educate the next generation of video-hungry schoolchildren. Other advances expected in the'90s: Machine translation of language, and telerobots with human guidance that will clean up crippled nuclear reactors and scour sclerotic arteries.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>U.S. SOCIETY</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 Demographics will change the face of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factory and office _ and of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> society _ in the coming decade. The private <ORGANIZATION> Population </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> reports that in the 1970s, 24.1 million young people entered the workforce, in the 1980s only 18.0 million did so, and in the 1990s the number is expected to decline to 15.6 million. Much of the dropoff is among non-Hispanic white males. Women and minority-group members will account for more than 80 percent of all new entrants in the labor force in the'90s, the bureau says. Some businesses, such as fast-food outlets, are already feeling the shortage of new labor-market entrants and have begun seeking out retired people to fill jobs.

<TEXT>
 Prominent personalities in political life, science, the arts and other fields were asked by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> to sum up their views of new directions in the world in the 1990s. Here are their responses:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>VALERY GISCARD D'ESTAING, French statesman and former president:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s exit from communism appears to be the most difficult process to manage in the next 10 years. No doubt it will involve periods of ... high inflation, and also political convulsions. As the states of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> move rather quickly toward the European model, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will seek a separate way, whose definition it probably will not be able to find soon. This will lead it to remain in a state of uncertainty and strong internal tension.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>LESTER R. BROWN, president of the Washington-based Worldwatch Institute:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The'90s promise to be the environmental decade, a time when environmental trends increasingly will shape economic trends. Rising world grain prices will likely be the first economic indicator to signal trouble in the relationship between ourselves, now numbering 5.2 billion, and the natural systems and resources on which we depend. ... As the decade unfolds, the degradation of the planet will begin showing up at harvest time. Reversing the deterioration of the planet will require governments everywhere to redefine security, recognizing that the principal threats to our future come less from military aggression and more from environmental degradation.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>J. MICHAEL BISHOP, U.S. cancer researcher, co-winner of 1989 Nobel
Prize in medicine:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The prospect that seems most important to me is the potential that our position as a pre-eminent nation in scientific research may be eroded. I attribute it to the decline in real funding for fundamental research. And to a decline in public education. ... I think our nation is in danger of not taking intellect seriously enough. ... Not even the parents of affluent children take the education of their children as seriously as they should. They look to it as an avenue to material success; they do not look to it for enrichment of adult life. ... The public no longer cares about the creative side of life.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DESMOND TUTU, South African Anglican archbishop:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 We are discovering a fundamental law of our human existence _ that we are made for interdependence with one another and with the rest of creation. Consequently there will be increasing revulsion with the arms race, with an increase in people's participation in the peace movement. The big powers will persuade their surrogates and clients to make peace in their respective areas. There will be an upsurge of concern for human rights and interest in participatory styles of government. ... AIDS and poverty will draw us closer together.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BAI HUA, leading Chinese poet and playwright:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Developments in the 1990s will be closer to the hopes of the common people. Changes in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> all illustrate this point. Also people are becoming more and more concerned with man's living environment, not only in the relationship between people. I think there is hope.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>GRO HARLEM BRUNDTLAND, former Norwegian prime minister:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 I hope that we will see an increased democratization in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> but also in other parts of the world and that human rights everywhere will be raised to a higher standard. People are more aware of the world economy and the world's ecology than was the case when we go back even one decade.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>MARGARET THATCHER, British prime minister:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Global environment _ protecting the ozone layer, working towards combatting the greenhouse effect _ are problems we must tackle together. On the political front, while maintaining a strong <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, we should continue to work for further nuclear disarmament. We must also continue to encourage the democratization process in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, where we have seen such encouraging developments recently. The prospects for progress in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> are also very much at the front of our minds. Closer to home, we shall need to ensure that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and its <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> partners develop into a truly common market.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>JUAN ANTONIO SAMARANCH, International Olympic Committee president:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 We have to face some dangers. One of the dangers is doping, but I think with the help of the governments and the international federations, we will win this fight. ... Commercialization is very necessary but we have to avoid its controlling sports. ... Speaking about the situation in the Communist countries, I will say that the political changes in these countries are also helping sports relations. The Olympic Games in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> were perhaps the best ever because there was a very good political ambience in the world.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>GEOFFREY PALMER, New Zealand prime minister:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 There is a danger that rapid economic growth in some parts of the developing world could be mistakenly interpreted as the end of the problems of economic imbalance between developed and developing countries. In the 1990s, the international community must sustain its commitment to development assistance efforts for deprived countries and the poorest people within those countries. `` Sustainable development'' _ development of resources without degradation of the environment _ will be the catchword of the next decade.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>NAGUIB MAHFOUZ, Egyptian winner of 1988 Nobel Prize in literature:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 At present in the Third World, readership has diminished because people are preoccupied with their problems, their economic problems. Art and literature are not flourishing. But hopefully inflation will decrease, and at least a small base of literature will be formed.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DEREK BOK, President, Harvard University:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Government agencies, foundations, corporations, and other institutions tug insistently at professors for advice on a wide variety of topics, while the public expresses irritation that faculty members fly about so much and neglect their teaching and students. Everyone is angry over rising college costs ... These conflicts reflect a mounting confusion in the country over what we really want of our colleges and universities and how we would like their most creative, knowledgeable professors to allocate their time. ... In the 1990s, universities, the government, and the public at large will need to work harder to reconcile their differences or we will surely damage institutions of great potential value that are pre-eminent in the world and essential to our society.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BARRY COMMONER, leading U.S. environmentalist:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 We enter the next decade with the troubling knowledge that the 20-year effort to clean up the environment has failed. ... Environmental pollution is an incurable disease; it can only be prevented. Pollution prevention means building new smog-less car engines; eliminating the use of agricultural chemicals by shifting to organic farming; replacing fossil fuels with solar energy. The transition to such ecologically sound production technologies will challenge the taboo against questioning the dominance of private interests over the public interest in environmental quality. In the 1990s, we will need a perestroika of our own.

 Bargain hunters had reason to rejoice this Christmas, but store owners had less cause for celebrating. Retailers rang up mostly respectable holiday sales gains but many relied on profit-eating discounts to woo customers. <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON>, publisher of the newsletter Retail Marketing Report, said Tuesday that judging by the evidence so far, his prediction of a 5 percent increase in holiday sales this year looks accurate. To eke out the estimated increase _ which falls short of 1988's 7 percent rise above the prior year _ retailers had to accept lower prices that pinched their profits `` I think the consumer had a very, very merry Christmas and I'm not so sure that the retailers did from a profit point of view,'' said analyst <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> PNC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> Many stores still are stuck with too much inventory, so post-Christmas price cutting is expected to be more extensive than normal, <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON> said. Holiday shoppers lived up to their reputation as procrastinators and did n't spend heavily until the final days before Christmas, helping to salvage the season for some retailers. Last year, a belated buying surge boosted business and more than made up for earlier weakness. `` Thank goodness it came and pulled out the Christmas season,'' said <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Hess </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Earlier, sales at the chain had been erratic _ healthy when the weather was favorable for shopping and poor when it was n't, he said. This past Saturday was the best day ever for <ORGANIZATION> Hess </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, a Pennsylvania-based chain of 76 department stores operating in 11 Eastern states and owned by <ORGANIZATION> Crown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Like other retailers, <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>'s made a special effort to get shoppers in the door `` We were as promotional as you can get. I do n't know how you can get more promotional than this Christmas season.'' For <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>'s, the merchandising tactic paid off. A big increase in sales volume offset the price markdowns and the chain appears likely to register unexpectedly strong fourth-quarter sales, <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> said. Not every retailer had to resort to unusually intense price-cutting. <ORGANIZATION> Dayton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hudson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which operates the Target discount chain and the <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Mervyn </PERSON>'s department stores, said business this year was slightly less promotional than in 1988. However, sales were good. `` We are very pleased with the results,'' said <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Macke </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of the Minneapolis-based retailer. `` We continue to expect a strong fourth quarter.'' Deep discounts, giveaways and other promotional gimmicks have been fiercest in the most competitive areas of the country, particularly in cities where department stores owned by heavily indebted <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> operate. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> stores such as <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s, The <LOCATION> Bon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marche </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Burdines </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>'s have been under pressure to generate sales to cover the parent company's debt payments. Stores emphasizing clothing indicated they enjoyed better results than general merchants, continuing a yearlong pattern. Frigid weather in many parts of the country sent shoppers searching for overcoats, sweaters, scarves and similar cold-weather garb, retailers said. <ORGANIZATION> J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which does the bulk of its business in clothing, finished the holiday season strongly, said spokesman <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> <PERSON> Muir </PERSON> He said double-digit sales gains occurred at many stores around the country run by the Texas-based retailer. The nation's biggest retailer, <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, benefited from a late surge in shopping, which reached a high point Saturday, spokesman <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Arms </PERSON> said. But overall Sears holiday sales probably will turn out to be about even with last year, when the retailer reported a 12.1 percent jump in sales over 1987. Most of the major <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> retailers will issue reports Jan. 4 on their sales in the weeks between Thanksgiving and New Year's Eve. <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Turk </PERSON>, a retail specialist with the accounting firm <ORGANIZATION> Deloitte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Touche </ORGANIZATION>, estimated that chains achieved sales gains of 5 percent to 8 percent over last year. `` The higher gains within this average clearly are among the specialty stores,'' she said. `` There is, however, a lot of disappointment because of the weak profitability environment.''

 Orange juice prices leaped on the futures market after a weekend freeze overwhelmed <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> citrus groves, but experts said consumers may escape big price increases because of a bumper crop in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. However, Big Chill'89 likely will drive up vegetable prices in the <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> because the cold wiped out thousands of acres of carrots, cauliflower, broccoli and other crops in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, agriculture officials said. Experts assessing the damage Tuesday said it was too early for definite predictions about prices. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> economist <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Parlett </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said price increases were likely, but he had n't changed his earlier forecast of a 3 percent to 5 percent overall rise in food prices in 1990. In <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, where the citrus industry is worth an estimated $ 3.5 billion a year, the Christmas cold wave struck with about 80 percent of the citrus crop still on the trees, and there was heavy icing of oranges and grapefruit. In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, an estimated 65 percent of the crop _ or $ 55 million worth wholesale _ was still on the trees, according to growers and farm officials. Fruit frozen on the trees can still be used for juice, as long as it's picked and processed before the weather warms too much, and crews raced through groves salvaging what they could. A large juice reserve in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, booming citrus production in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and swift processing of iced oranges should stabilize juice prices somewhat, said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunter </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citrus </ORGANIZATION>. `` Because of that, there might be a more moderate impact than we might expect for a freeze year,'' <PERSON> Gunter </PERSON> said. Ever-jumpy commodities traders ran up the price of frozen orange juice futures _ in effect a contract to buy a set amount of juice on a specified date. The contract for January delivery of frozen concentrated orange juice jumped 16.1 cents to $ 1.531 a pound Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, an 11.8 percent gain. The contracts for March and May delivery rose their permitted daily limits of 5 cents a pound. The freeze did n't affect <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> citrus, which generally is sold fresh rather than frozen for juice. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> farmers use about 90 percent of their oranges for juice and about 50 percent of the grapefruit. Consumers' biggest worry from the freeze appeared to be vegetable prices. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> farmers reported widespread damage to vegetable crops from one end of the peninsula to the other, said state Agriculture Commissioner <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Conner </PERSON>. Much of the winter vegetable crop was destined for the northeastern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and central and south <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> growers said thousands of acres of carrots, radishes, cauliflower and broccoli were destroyed and that little would be salvageable. Near-total losses were reported in winter vegetables in large areas of the state, and heavy losses of beans, squash, corn, tomatoes and watermelons. Strawberries, ornamental plants and other crops also were hard hit. `` With shortages, naturally prices will go up,'' <PERSON> Conner </PERSON> said. Vegetable losses are `` a more temporary kind of thing'' because those crops can be replanted, noted the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s Parlett. Continued production from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> could also cushion the blow, he said. `` There's no doubt that some of the supplies will be cut short, and we'll probably see higher prices'' at produce counters, <PERSON> Parlett </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> growers were optimistic that trees throughout the 700,000-acre citrus belt had been spared extensive damage. Nevertheless, losses to the industry _ just starting to recover from disastrous freezes in 1983 and 1985 _ were expected to be heavy. `` Growers are concerned about their trees,'' said <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> McKown </PERSON>, executive vice president of Lakeland-based <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citrus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mutual </ORGANIZATION>, a trade association of more than 12,000 growers. `` But right now, we do n't see the black leaves that we had in 1983.'' Freeze fallout could include unemployment for thousands of migrant farm workers. Once the rush to save the oranges subsides and the crops disappear, those workers workers could lose their jobs, said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON>, program manager for the Beth-El Mission in <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Former Employee Says Firm Covered Up Microchip Defects</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FULLERTON, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A former employee of the <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> division here sued the company for $ 9.6 billion, contending it covered up a potential defect in more than 4 million computer chips used in defense systems. The suit was filed in June in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION> and was unsealed and served Tuesday, said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbaro </PERSON>, an attorney for plaintiff <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Denlinger </PERSON>. `` We think our national security is compromised,'' <PERSON> Barbaro </PERSON> said. The suit was brought under the federal False Claims Act, which allows so-called `` whistleblowers'' to share in damage awards in defense fraud cases. <PERSON> Denlinger </PERSON>, a former senior staff engineer at the <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> division, alleged that defective chips installed since 1984 caused two failures in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s submarine-launched Advance Capability torpedo system. While routine screening found two defective chips in torpedoes, but the suit's allegations are wrong, said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Reeder </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>' Ground Systems Group here. `` Erroneous,'' <PERSON> Reeder </PERSON> said. `` We have never had any failure of the test torpedoes due to hardware problems during any of the hundreds of runs we have gone through.'' The microchips were used in several defense systems, including an information-processing system for the radar on board the U.S.S. <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>, which mistakenly shot down an Iranian commercial jetliner in 1988, the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today. In his suit, <PERSON> Denlinger </PERSON> said his repeated memos about possible cracking of the chips because of a soldering process were ignored. He resigned in November 1988. The basis for the unusually large multibillion-dollar damage request was not immediately available. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said Tuesday that it has inspected every chip since becoming aware of a cracking problem in 1985, and said it was an industrywide problem, the Times said. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> already is the target of another defense-related lawsuit. It alleges that the Radar Systems Group in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Segundo </LOCATION> overcharged the government $ 50 million on four radar programs, including one for the B-2 stealth bomber. That suit seeks $ 120 million in damages.

 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's second largest carrier, has announced it will match some winter fare cuts of as much as 30 percent introduced by rival <ORGANIZATION> Midway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. United's action spread the fare-cutting that began last week when <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> reduced prices on its longer routes, a move other carriers followed on a limited basis Midway, which operates its main hub out of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Midway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, had announced one-way fares ranging from $ 19 to $ 99 across its 50-city route system within the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` The entire industry is seeing soft bookings the first quarter,'' said Midway spokeswoman <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Podlesny </PERSON>, in explaining the fare cuts. Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>, whose main hub is at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, said Tuesday it would match the fare cuts on routes where it competes with Midway. `` We're going to be competitive, but not on all flights,'' said <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>. `` In <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, for example, we'll offer the reduced fares on specific flights, but not on all.'' Midway reduced its Chicago-Los Angeles round-trip fare from $ 318 to $ 198, and its Chicago-Washington round-trip fare from $ 228 to $ 158.

 Japanese firms spent a record 4.55 trillion yen, or $ 32 billion, on entertainment and gifts in 1988, more than the government plans to spend on defense next year, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. Total expense account spending rose by 8.7 percent from the previous high of 4.19 trillion yen, or $ 29 billion, in 1987, said an agency official, speaking on condition of anonymity. He said the agency estimated total expense account spending based on a survey of 57,599 of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s 1,851,653 companies that closed their annual accounts in January 1989. The survey showed average expense account spending of 3 cents for every $ 7 in company income, the official said. Japanese executives often are given carte blanche to entertain at exclusive night clubs and Japanese-style inns. Inviting clients for golf and presenting gifts are other customary entertainment expenses. The government's draft budget for the fiscal year beginning in April 1990 allocates 4.14 trillion yen, or $ 29.1 billion, for defense spending, up 5.5 percent from fiscal 1989.

 Grain and soybean futures prices were little changed in quiet early trading today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as export optimism offset selling linked to warmer temperatures in the nation's midsection. Trading was light, which is typical for a holiday period. The markets opened mostly lower, extending the weaker pattern established Tuesday due to warmer temperatures in the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> after a two-week cold spell. But selling pressure waned and buying interest surfaced early in the session, partly reflecting the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s weekly grain-inspections report, which showed unexpectedly large exports of corn, wheat and soybeans last week. Some buying also stemmed from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s overnight purchase of 180,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn and from expectations that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> will tender tonight for 26,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybean oil, said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>ATM Usage During Holidays On The Rise</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 For many people, trips to crowded shopping malls, airports or restaurants this holiday season were n't complete without a stop at an automated teller machine. One of the world's largest ATM networks, <ORGANIZATION> Plus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, predicts that between Dec. 1 and New Year's Day consumers will have used the high-tech bank machines twice as much as last year, largely for withdrawals. That's good news for many financial institutions who charge anywhere from 10 cents to $ 3 per transaction for such ATM services as cash withdrawals, deposits, transfers or balance inquiries. `` Consumers have clearly embraced the idea of using ATMs. They've become more confident in technolgoy,'' said <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Browning </PERSON>, president of Plus System, which estimates its ATM customers will withdraw more than $ 500 million through 6.5 million transactions this month At the same time usage has risen and the number of available ATMs has grown since their introduction more than a decade ago, the likelihood of fraud committed by and against consumers also has increased, especially during the holidays, experts say. `` The potential for it to rise is there just as credit-card fraud rose as people started to use their cards more and -LRB- thieves -RRB- became more aware of how they can beat the system,'' said <PERSON> Marsha </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. There are few estimates available on ATM-related losses. But some experts say it runs as high as $ 200 million a year and has the potential to move into the billions as it has in the credit-card industry. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> narrowly escaped $ 14 million in potential losses earlier this year after uncovering a scam in which several insiders planned to use stolen secret codes of ATM cardholders to withdraw money from 8,000 bank accounts. The group planned to carry out the scheme with bogus bank cards made of posterboard. A recent survey by the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> found that 25 percent of the 1,200 banks polled reported cases of fraud committed by a customer. Thirteen percent reported fraud against a customer. The average financial institution had 62 cases of ATM fraud, or about one incident for every 28,070 transactions, last year, according to another study by <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rolling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meadows </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. That was down sharply from the 390 incidents reported in 1986, due largely, the <ORGANIZATION> BIA </ORGANIZATION> says, to increased safeguards by banks ATM fraud can include from white-collar scams, such as thieves withdrawing money after stealing bank customers' personal identification numbers; strong-armed tactics, like robberies at ATM locations; or overwithdrawals by customers. Still, fraud cases involving ATM cards are much rarer than with credit cards. That's because in order to use an ATM card a thief must also gain access to the person's personal identification code _ usually a secret four-digit number punched into an ATM keyboard to gain access to an account. Despite this safeguard, a significant number of <ORGANIZATION> ATM </ORGANIZATION> cardholders _ about 25 percent by some accounts _ still make the mistake of noting their PINs either on the back of their cards or somewhere in their wallets. Purse snatchers, usually out in full force during the holidays, often can figure out what the number stands for and use it long before the card is missed. `` While it is important for you to read you monthly credit-card statement to check for unauthorized charges, it's even more crucial to read your bank statement to find unauthorized withdrawal through an ATM,'' said <PERSON> Elgie </PERSON> <PERSON> Holstein </PERSON>, director of the consumer group <ORGANIZATION> Bankcard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Herndon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Holstein </PERSON> says consumers receive far less protection on ATM cards than on credit cards Liability from losses on an ATM card is $ 50 for the first two days after it is reported missing, the same as with credit cards. But it rises to $ 500 for the next 60 days from the time a bank statement is mailed out, after which there is technically no limit. Financial institutions have built a number of safeguards into the ATM system to prevent customers from seeing their savings wiped out, such as placing limits on the amount of an ATM withdrawal per transaction. In addition, the computers that operate ATMs are kept in high security areas in financial institutions. The data that travels across the wires each time a customer uses a machine is `` scrambled,'' meaning the information never travels across the line the same way twice. <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Melnikoff </PERSON>, vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION>'s security and risk management division, says technology exists to make it virtually impossible for anybody but the cardholder to withdraw money from his or her account. Among those being considered are identification on the basis of fingerprints, handprints or a customer's retinas. `` -LRB- But -RRB- it has to be a practical approach,'' <PERSON> Melnikoff </PERSON> said. `` Not everyone might feel comfortable sticking their face in a device so their retinas could be examined.''

 Sales of existing homes advanced 3.2 percent in November, with a big jump in activity in the South spurring the fastest growth rate in 11 months, a real estate trade group reported Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> said sales of existing single-family homes rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.59 million units last month, the best performance since sales reached a rate of 3.92 million units in December 1988. The 3.2 percent October-to-November sales increase followed a 1.1 percent decline in October. It was the biggest percentage gain since a 4.5 percent rise in August. Analysts credited declining mortgage rates for the upturn in sales activity. But they said that housing sales presented a mixed picture with some areas of the country such as the Northeast hurting because of a rapid surge in prices in the past several years. `` Some large, high-cost markets have experienced some softening this year. However, many smaller, secondary cities are quite strong,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON>, chief economist for the realtors. He said the disparity in sales between high-cost areas and more moderately priced markets should continue in 1990. Sluggish sales in high-cost areas has prompted some fears of a coming housing recession, but <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>, president of the realtors group, said the doomsayers would be proven wrong. `` People who are predicting hard times for housing are not considering how much prices rose in high-cost areas over the past few years,'' said <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>, who cited the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, where the median price is up 85 percent from five years ago. <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON> predicted that falling mortgage rates would continue to boost home sales in coming months. The national average for fixed-rate mortgages dipped to 9.69 percent last week, down from a high last March of 11.22 percent. The median price for homes sold in November edged up 0.4 percent to $ 93,000. The West pulled ahead of the Northeast in November as the region with the highest priced homes, recording a median resale cost of $ 150,200 last month. The Northeast was second with a median price of $ 145,800, followed by the South at $ 82,400 and the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> at $ 70,900. The median is the point at which half the homes sold for more and half for less. In November, the sales increase was led by a 9.2 percent jump in sales in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, where homes were sold at an annual rate of 1.42 million units in November. Sales were up 3.2 percent in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> to an annual rate of 640,000 units. The <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> posted a 1.7 percent rise to an annual rate of 590,000 units. Sales in the Midwest were down 4 percent to an annual rate of 950,000 units. All of the percentage comparisons were with October sales rates. When compared to sales in November 1988, the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> had a small increase of 1.1 percent while activity in the South was up by 0.7 percent. However, sales in the Northeast are down 13.2 percent when compared to a year ago while sales in the West are off by 5.9 percent compared to November 1988.

 Manufacturers who supply merchandise to <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s department stores continued to watch Wednesday for clues whether the retail operations would file for bankruptcy protection. In the meantime, many of the clothing makers and other companies that do business with the stores have stopped shipments or postponed decisions about future shipments amid worries about <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s solvency. Toronto-based <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s nearly 260 department stores around the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are continuing to sell and stock goods but executives at some of the stores said this week that they have noticed shipment disruptions. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> announced three weeks ago that its Cincinnati-based retail divisions, <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, might seek protection from creditors in bankruptcy court early next year. `` It's now a game of Russian roulette,'' said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Millstein </PERSON>, publisher of the Fashion Network Report. `` The spigot's been turned off on Seventh Avenue,'' he said referring to the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> garment district where many apparel companies have their headquarters. `` The only way to turn it back on is some sort of resolution of the current situation,'' he said. Merchandise credit companies and several clothing makers announced before Christmas that they had suspended business with <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> and Allied as a result of <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s financial problems. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> and Allied warned in a quarterly financial statement in mid-December that they might seek bankruptcy protection as early as next month if $ 6.9 billion in debt ca n't be restructured. The debt was created as part of <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s acquisition of the department store chains. Among <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s chains are <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s, <LOCATION> Burdines </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>'s, <ORGANIZATION> Abraham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Straus </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON> and others. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Suilichem </PERSON>, senior vice president and director of marketing at Atlanta-based <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>'s, said there have been some limited interruptions in shipments. `` We expect there will be some more. But at this point, it's been really negligible,'' he said One of <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>'s vendors, New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Greif </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>, said it wo n't make any shipments until the financial health of <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>'s parent becomes clearer <PERSON> Greif </PERSON> supplies men's suits and sport coats under the <ORGANIZATION> Polo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> labels. `` They're hanging and waiting to go out,'' said <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Fryman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Greif </PERSON>'s president and chief executive officer. He said <PERSON> Greif </PERSON> already has manufactured hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of goods for <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>'s and other <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> units. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s suppliers are concerned about their prospects if a filing under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code ensues. `` What I see happening, and what is going to make me angry along with all -LRB- the -RRB- other customers owed money, is a Chapter 11 just before they have to pay their debts,'' said <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> Konheim </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Nicole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, a dress maker. `` The perfect time is just prior to Jan. 10.'' The Jan. 10 date is when payment is due for the goods suppliers shipped to <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> in late November and December. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> announced Friday that <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> had informed <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> that it might technically be in default on a loan agreement because it can not provide assurance about its solvency. <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION>, which is <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s major lender, could call for full repayment on the $ 2.34 billion in loans it made for acquisition financing if <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> ca n't remedy the situation by Dec. 31

 When it comes to quackgrass, a slimy, crop-chewing slug is a dead duck, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. Weed scientist <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagin </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said that when quackgrass is killed, it releases a compound into the soil that acts as a nerve poison against slugs. `` The poison is highly specific to slugs,'' he said. `` It has been tested with no ill effects on three species of freshwater snails, as well as mammals in general.'' <PERSON> Hagin </PERSON>, who works at the agency's <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ithaca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, has isolated and synthesized the quackgrass compound. A patent on the material is in the works, which could clear the way for commercial development of a new lethal bait for slugs. Commercial poisons are available now to kill slugs, but those also are toxic to birds and animals, he said. The quackgrass treatment could be applied at much lower rates and at less cost. <PERSON> Hagin </PERSON> field-tested the compound for two years in snapbeans, alfalfa and other crops. He said the snapbean yields were nearly doubled as a result of reduced slug damage. Quackgrass is widespread and competes strongly for fertilizer and water in crops such as corn, soybeans and forages, <PERSON> Hagin </PERSON> said. Slugs are especially troublesome in humid areas and have taken a heavy toll of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> strawberry fields and citrus orchards. <PERSON> Hagin </PERSON> said they also interfere with corn production on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. Further, slugs are a serious problem in no-till or minimum-tillage farming, where the soil is not cultivated heavily. `` We're currently looking at the possibility of using the slug poison compound as a seed treatment in minimum-tillage situations,'' <PERSON> Hagin </PERSON> said. `` We might be able to get the crop plants to take this material up as a defense against slug attacks.'' <PERSON> Hagin </PERSON> accidentally discovered the quackgrass connection in 1981 after he had used herbicides to get rid of weeds before he planted no-till corn on land where red clover had been raised. `` When the corn was about six inches tall, I noticed that slugs were attacking it heavily,'' he said. `` But there were little islands in the field where quackgrass had been growing with the clover, and in those areas the slugs were n't attacking the corn at all.'' Quackgrass is known to leave two `` allelopathic'' chemical compounds behind in the soil that inhibit the growth of certain other plants. But those are different from the compound that kills the slugs, <PERSON> Hagin </PERSON> said.

 The furor that marked approval of the free trade agreement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has subsided, but critics in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> blame the year-old pact for bad economic news ranging from unemployment to a big rise in imports. The agreement's supporters, just as adamantly, credit it with operating smoothly and preparing the way for growth. The pact that took effect on Jan. 1, 1989, phases out over a 10-year period virtually all remaining tariffs in the world's largest trading partnership Most analysts agree that no method has been devised to measure its early effects accurately. `` I think the concrete ways to measure it are difficult at this point,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> deWilde </PERSON>, a professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ontario </ORGANIZATION>'s business school. `` It's an adjustment in the way <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> conduct a very large trading relationship.'' `` It's going to be very difficult to calculate the precise impact,'' economist <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rugman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toronto </ORGANIZATION> said. The value of two-way trade in goods grew dramatically during the past decade, more than doubling from $ 76.85 billion in 1980 to $ 153.02 billion in 1988, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Commerce Department figures show. In all of those years, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> bought more goods from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> than the Canadians bought in return, netting <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> a trade surplus that helped restrain inflation and keep people working. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> approved the pact only after a heated election campaign dominated by the trade debate returned Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> for a second consecutive majority government. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> argued that the agreement he had signed with then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would ensure <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s access to the vastly larger <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market at a time when protectionism was increasing around the world. His opponents insisted the pact was unnecessary because 80 percent of U.S.-Canadian trade already was tariff-free. By lowering the remaining barriers, the opponents argued, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> would be swamped culturally and economically by its more populous, powerful southern neighbor. The argument lingers on. `` The fact is, when choices have to be made between saving Canadian and American jobs, multinational firms sacrifice Canadian jobs every time,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, leader of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in early December following a flurry of announcements about plant closings and layoffs. Finance Minister <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> replied that any job losses are unfortunate, `` but we have to realize we have a dynamic economy. There are jobs that are being created every day, there are jobs being lost every day.'' The Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, a key opponent of the trade agreement, has a list of 70,000 jobs lost in plant closings and layoffs this year, by such companies as <PERSON> Gerber </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Burlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Maude </PERSON> <PERSON> Barlow </PERSON>, head of the nationalistic Council of Canadians that opposes the agreement, said the trends sending jobs to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> over Canadian operations are clear even if not every layoff can be traced directly to free trade. A survey taken for the national news weekly <PERSON> Maclean </PERSON>'s at yearend found that 52 percent of Canadians think the free trade agreement is a bad idea, up from 32 percent a year ago. But, while 42 percent of Canadians a year ago believed that free trade was the most important issue facing the country, only 7 percent believe that now. The persistent criticism of the trade agreement parallels evidence of an economic slowdown in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, with some warnings of an imminent recession. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s healthy trade balance, historically considered a sign of economic strength, showed a monthly deficit in October, the first time that has happened in more than 13 years. Federal officials attributed the $ 362 million shortfall partly to the high value of the Canadian dollar, which makes imports cheaper and Canadian goods more expensive. Government critics blamed the trade agreement. `` Is this what the prime minister meant when he said that his trade deal would make our trade more and more secure?'' Turner asked. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> replied that the deficit reflected increased imports of capital goods and machinery, which he said will help <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> restructure its industries and exploit the free trade pact more effectively. The agreement not only phases out tariffs but also creates new ways to settle trade disputes and eases investment and the movement of employees between the two countries. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> agreed recently that the pact was working well enough to merit acceleration of tariff cuts on an additional $ 6 billion worth of trade starting April 1. `` Overall, we're extremely satisfied,'' Trade Minister <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosbie </PERSON> said Nov. 30 after the second meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> created by the pact. `` It's remarkable how well it is working and what few disputes we have,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> told reporters at the meeting in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION>. Although the impact of the trade agreement may be difficult to measure, companies now refer to it regularly in their planning. `` It's accelerated the need for Canadian corporate strategists to think about the performance of their companies in a larger context,'' said deWilde, of the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> business school in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Champion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Road </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, said his company has started to examine Japanese management techniques and take other steps to increase productivity as his larger <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> competitors discover the Canadian market. `` I truly believe that before free trade many of our <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> competitors did not know where <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> was,'' he said at a forum for exporters. `` We can complain, or we can do something about it.''

 The dollar drifted mostly lower in very thin pre-holiday trading Wednesday, dipping to what traders said was its lowest level against the West German mark since the spring of 1988. Gold prices, meanwhile, declined sharply in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and overseas. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $ 400.80 a troy ounce, down $ 6 from Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, quoted a late bid for gold at $ 400.55 an ounce, off $ 6.45. Currency dealers said the dollar remained pressured by the continued strength of the West German mark and from expectations that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates will decline further because of weakness in the American economy. The mark has been on the rise for several weeks amid rapid political and economic reforms in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Many economists predict <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s economy will be bolstered as more Eastern European countries, including neighboring <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, open their doors to the West. In late <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> trading, the dollar closed at 1.6895 West German marks, down from 1.7090 Tuesday. <PERSON> Gabriele </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmitt </PERSON>, a currency trader with the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, said that was the weakest close this year and the lowest level since April 1988. Although sentiment toward the dollar remains bullish, dealers said they expect trading to remain very light in the two days before the long New Year's holiday weekend. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar fell to 142.10 Japanese yen from 142.37 yen Tuesday. It traded at 142.05 yen in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, and at 142.00 yen in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, up from 141.845 yen Tuesday. The dollar was weaker against the British pound. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, sterling rose to $ 1.6255 from $ 1.6205 late Friday. Later, in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, it fetched $ 1.6275, up from $ 1.6265 Tuesday. Most European financial markets were closed on Monday and Tuesday for the Christmas holiday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with Tuesday's quotes, included: 1.5295 Swiss francs, down from 1.54525; 5.7600 French francs, down from 5.8020; 1.15735 Canadian dollars, down from 1.6005; and 1,263.75 Italian lire, down from 1,272.75 Late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> compared with Friday: 1.6895 West German marks, down from 1.7090; 1.5355 Swiss francs, down from 1.5475; 5.7760 French francs, down from 5.8385; 1.9080 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9330; 1,266.00 Italian lire, down from 1,277.75; 1.1587 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1585. Gold closed in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a late bid price of $ 406.25 an ounce, down from $ 412.25 Friday. It fell in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION> to $ 406 an ounce from $ 413. In <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold closed at $ 408.49 an ounce, down $ 5.45 from Tuesday. Silver prices also slipped.

<HEAD>State Investigates Southern Bell Pay Phone Commissions</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s attorney general said Wednesday the state is investigating whether <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> underpaid commissions for pay telephone use to governments in several Southeastern states. Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Butterworth </PERSON> said the delinquent commissions could total in the millions of dollars but determining the exact amount has been hampered by the telephone company's inability to provide records. The commissions were to have been paid over two years starting in August 1986. <PERSON> Butterworth </PERSON> said Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> knew of the problem in February 1987, but did nothing until a report in The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> last month. `` Computer mistakes do happen,'' he said. `` It is troubling, however, that <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> knew about this problem for more than 2 -LCB- years, yet apparently made little effort to reimburse its short-changed government customers.'' <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> contracts with government agencies to put pay phones in buildings and then pays a percentage based on usage. Southern Bell did not immediately return calls seeking comment. Officials previously have denied any wrongdoing and said the mistake was caused by a computer error. <PERSON> Butterworth </PERSON> said the failure to make back-payments promptly could violate the state's grand theft law. <PERSON> Butterworth </PERSON> said he began sending letters Wednesday to federal, state and local agencies advising them not to accept restitution from <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> until his office accounts for the delinquent commissions. `` As soon as we can determine what appears to be owed, we will advise you,'' <PERSON> Butterworth </PERSON> said in one letter. `` You may well be entitled to to a claim exceeding the contract amount plus interest.'' <PERSON> Butterworth </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> may owe commissions to agencies in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. In a letter last week to <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, <PERSON> Butterworth </PERSON> said key documents regarding the commissions were lost or destroyed and that the company initially said it could not replace them. Now, however, <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> is `` reconstructing'' those records, he said. <PERSON> Butterworth </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> to ensure that <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> does not attempt to pay restitution and that whatever amount the utility believes it owes be placed in an interest-bearing trust account until the investigation ends. The <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> reported that <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> had underpaid <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> agencies more than $ 150,000 in commissions. The newspaper quoted a former utility manager as saying the company knew the revenue reports were wrong.

 The stock market gained ground in a quiet session Wednesday, bidding again to mount a yearend rally. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 2.13 on Tuesday, climbed 15.14 to 2,724.40. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 3 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 928 up, 560 down and 476 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 133.73 million shares, up from 77.61 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 176.89 million shares. Analysts found little in the economic news to stir the market out of its recent lethargy. Interest rates were narrowly mixed in the credit markets. But traders still appeared to be hopeful that stocks might gather strength in early 1990, once yearend maneuvering by investors for tax and portfolio reporting purposes is out of the way.

<TEXT>
 At an age when most men would consider waking up in the morning an accomplishment, <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON>. Long gets his kicks by creating headlines in financial publications around the world. The 90-year-old chairman emeritus of <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> has made a career out of taking the lead in cutting the prime lending rate and watching other banks follow in his tracks. Until Nov. 8, <PERSON> Long </PERSON> was batting .900 as a bellwether. But other banks did n't match him that time and he became news because <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> had to backtrack three weeks later and readjust its prime from 10 percent to 10.5 percent. Considering that it was the first time in at least 10 years that he has had to retreat, <PERSON> Long </PERSON> took it well. `` We're still batting about .875,'' he said. `` That's still a pretty good average.'' In fact, <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said, the move was well worth it. `` What we really did was give our commercial customers a Christmas bonus a little early,'' he said. `` We feel it was an excellent investment from an advertising and public relations standpoint.'' The prime rate is important because it is used by many banks as a basis for determining rates on a wide range of other loans, including highly popular home-equity loans. A drop in the prime would be followed by lower interest rates for loans to consumers and small businesses. Speculation has persisted in the past few weeks that banks would cut the prime rate because their own borrowing costs have declined, a result of recent credit-easing moves by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's central bank, to forestall an economic downturn. As of this past week, however, neither Long's bank nor any other appeared willing to lower the prime rate. Using the year 1989 as an example of Long's influence on the banking industry, the prime rate rested at 11.5 percent until Friday, June 2. That's when Long announced <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> was dropping its prime to 11 percent. On Monday, the next work day, all the major banks in the country followed. On Friday, July 7, <PERSON> Long </PERSON> again rattled the industry's chains and dropped his prime to 10.5 percent. The following Monday, only <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> followed <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>'s lead. It was n't until the 29th that <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> joined them and it was two more days before the other big banks fell into step Then came Nov. 8 and the cut that separated <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> from the rest of the pack. `` I.A. Long sort of hung himself out there to dry,'' said <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Worseck </PERSON>, chief economist at <ORGANIZATION> A.G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Son, <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> a <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> investment firm. `` I think the optimists got a little bit ahead of themselves on this.'' Long said one of the reasons he erred was the difficulty in interpreting the behavior of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, which historically has acted with great secrecy in order to keep financial markets stable. But the nation's central bank can send subtle signals about its possible intentions, partly by control over the amount of money available to lend. That control sometimes can be seen in the behavior of the federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks. The rate had fallen below 8.5 percent in November, convincing Long that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> was easing and it was time for a prime-rate cut. Then the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> appeared to suddenly reverse itself and the federal funds rate rose to 8.75 on Nov. 28, forcing Long to backtrack. Some <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> bankers may have enjoyed seeing Long with egg on his face, but the old veteran says his aim, ever since he began his rate crusade in the 1970s, has never been to make the big banks look bad. `` Our policy, our ambition, is not to upstage the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> banks,'' <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said. `` Our customers are very appreciative of the fact that they do n't have to wait for what banks in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> do. We make our own decisions.'' Those decisions, he said, are based on lengthy analysis. He said <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> looks at trends rather than specific economic indicators and he said he prefers to look at a six month period. Long broke into banking with the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in 1920. After organizing the first branch bank in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> in 1922, he came to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> in 1927 and has never left the area. Named president of <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in 1953, Long soon became its largest stockholder. He often is called Col. <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, a title that has stuck since he served a term as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. `` The bank has had the same location and the same name for 69 years,'' said Long. The bank's president, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Berra </PERSON>, and a vice chairman, <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Giacoma </PERSON>, were both hired by Long 29 years ago. Long finally sold controlling interest in the institution in 1984. `` I think it's interesting that every time we get in the news for being a national leader they call us ` a small bank,''' Long said. `` But if you look at the figres, we're in the top 5 percent nationally and we're the largest independent bank in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>.'' As chairman emeritus, Long is n't involved in day-to-day operations of the bank, but he remains active and is considered an authority on interest rates. `` I enjoy being here every day, keeping in touch with what's going on,'' he said `` It's really a lot of fun. I attribute my longivity to having steady employment and my wife of 51 years.'' As for retirement, <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said, `` I have n't given it a thought. I'll worry about it when I get closer to retirement age.''

<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Inman </PERSON>, a former intelligence chief, has resigned as head of <ORGANIZATION> Westmark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a defense electronics contractor striving to pay for its $ 867 million buyout of <ORGANIZATION> Tracor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Westmark </ORGANIZATION>, whose sole holding is <ORGANIZATION> Tracor </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Inman </PERSON> `` initiated the action after concluding that a transition in management would facilitate the long-term financial and organizational decisions which will be made at <ORGANIZATION> Westmark </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Tracor </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Inman </PERSON>, who submitted his resignation Friday, said Tuesday he made the decision nine days ago and `` the offers have begun to flow.'' He said his future probably would involve technology investments, and that he will make a decision within six weeks. Earlier, <PERSON> Inman </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Week </ORGANIZATION> magazine he planned to write a book about leveraged buyouts, the practice of using cash flow or asset sales to pay off money borrowed to buy a company. <PERSON> Inman </PERSON> has held the positions of chairman, president and chief executive officer at both <ORGANIZATION> Tracor </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Westmark </ORGANIZATION> since 1987. Austin-based <ORGANIZATION> Westmark </ORGANIZATION> announced that <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, managing partner of <ORGANIZATION> Mason </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Best </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, was elected chairman and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> Westmark </ORGANIZATION> on an interim basis. <ORGANIZATION> Mason </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Best </ORGANIZATION> is a Dallas-based merchant bank that founded <ORGANIZATION> Westmark </ORGANIZATION> and is its largest shareholder. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> served as chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Westmark </ORGANIZATION> during its formation and as a director until two years ago. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Moyer </PERSON> has been named acting president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Tracor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Westmark </ORGANIZATION> was created in 1986 to purchase electronics companies, and bought <ORGANIZATION> Tracor </ORGANIZATION> the following year. But the <ORGANIZATION> Tracor </ORGANIZATION> purchase was funded with high-yield bonds, loading the company with high-cost debt. Declining margins have further squeezed the company, which announced this month it was seeking to sell off assets to pay down the debt. <ORGANIZATION> Westmark </ORGANIZATION> has a $ 16 million interest payment on the junk bonds due Feb. 1. <ORGANIZATION> Tracor </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, produces advanced defense electronics systems. It also modifies commercial and government aircraft and makes analytical instruments and electrical components. <PERSON> Inman </PERSON> joined <ORGANIZATION> Westmark </ORGANIZATION> in 1986. Prior to that, he was the first director of <ORGANIZATION> Microelectronics </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> MCC </ORGANIZATION> was the first government-approved consortium to help the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> computer industry regain competitive advantages. <PERSON> Inman </PERSON> spent 30 years in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, and rose to the rank of admiral.

<HEAD>Heating Oil Up Sharply Again; Gold, Silver Plunge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Heating oil futures rose dramatically again Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as speculation continued that supplies would be tight amid continued cold weather. On other commodity markets, gold and silver prices plummeted as investment buying dried up; orange juice futures were widely mixed; livestock and meat were mixed; and grains and soybeans were mostly lower. With temperatures slowly warming, oil traders focused on reports of reduced production capacity at the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, where several refineries were forced to shut down because of cold-weather damage to equipment. The spot January heating-oil contract again led the gainers but analysts said the market could become extremely volatile in the next two sessions as the January contracts approach expiration on Friday. `` The risk-to-reward at these price levels dictates a lot of prudence and probably profit-taking,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, research director with <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Wholesale home heating oil settled .36 cent lower to 7.23 cent higher with January at 99.71 cents a gallon, a six-year high. In other energy futures, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate crude oil finished .13 cent lower to .16 cent higher with February at $ 21.78 a barrel and unleaded gasoline was .09 cent lower to 2.45 cents higher with January at 60.85 cents a gallon. Gold futures settled $ 6 to $ 7 lower on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> with the spot contract for delivery in December at $ 400.80 a troy ounce, a five-week low. Silver futures fell 27.2 cents to 30.8 cents with spot December settling at a seven-week low of $ 5.24 a troy ounce. Market analysts said the investment buying that drove precious metals up sharply in October and November had dwindled with the easing of international tensions. That development, compounded by typically thin holiday trading conditions, caused a dearth of willing buyers when commercial traders turned sellers early in Wednesday's session. `` There was nothing on the other side,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` As the market started breaking through chart support, you started seeing some computer-fund selling, which was not easily absorbed by speculators so the market pretty much got hammered.'' The recent bull move had carried spot gold to almost $ 420 an ounce and spot silver to nearly $ 5.90. Most orange juice futures soared the permitted daily limit of 5 cents a pound on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> but the January contract fell 2.95 cents to $ 1.5015 a pound amid profit-taking after Tuesday's strong gains. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> officials said they still could not estimate the damage from the weekend freeze in the orange groves, but an increasing number of experts said Brazilian imports and stockpiled <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> juice should prevent a sharp rise in cash prices. Cattle futures fell on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> amid profit-taking after steep gains on Tuesday. Hog futures rose and pork belly futures fell in light trading ahead of the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s monthly cold storage report. The report showed 68.7 million pounds of bellies in cold storage as of Dec. 1 compared with 39.8 million pounds a month earlier and 93.3 million pounds a year ago. Live cattle settled .15 cent to .48 cent lower with February at 77.45 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .43 cent lower with January at 84.82 cents a pound; hogs were .08 cent to .35 cent higher with February at 49.25 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .57 cent lower to .15 cent higher with February at 49.20 cents a pound. Grain and soybean futures prices ended mostly lower on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, led by a drop in the soybean market that analysts attributed mainly to technical factors. Wheat futures settled \ cent to 3 -RCB- cents lower with March at $ 4.06 \ a bushel; corn was unchanged to -LCB- cent higher with March at $ 2.39 a bushel; oats were -LCB- cent lower to -LCB- cent lower with March at $ 1.52 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 1 -RCB- cents to 4 cents lower with January at $ 5.64 -LCB- a bushel

 A small film company that makes videos of the nation's top tourist attractions said Wednesday it had settled a breach-of-contract lawsuit against a division of photography giant <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a co-founder VideoTours, said the company had agreed to drop its lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Programs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>'s home video division, in exchange for an undisclosed cash The agreement also calls for <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> to cease marketing VideoTours' tapes and pay certain royalties due its clients, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> declined to discuss specifics of the settlement, but said it meant the affiliation between the two companies _ one with revenues of $ 17 billion, the other with sales of $ 1 million _ was over. Glastonbury-based VideoTours produces videos of top tourist attractions so viewers can `` visit'' the sites without leaving their living rooms. VideoTours filed suit in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> in October, alleging breach of contract in its distribution deal with <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>. The lawsuit sought more than $ 50,000 in damages. VideoTours charged that <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> failed to help VideoTours market and promote videos already produced and assist in financing additional productions. It also charged that <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> failed to pay royalties to VideoTours clients, many of whom are non-profit institutions, monitor on-site sales, refill inventories and maintain displays with zoos, aquariums and museums where the tapes are sold. VideoTours, founded in 1986, has produced 13 videos featuring the <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aquarium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sturbridge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mystic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seaport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and other sites.

<HEAD>Great Northern Claims Takeover Would Prevent Needed Expenditures</HEAD>

 <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nekoosa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday in federal court that needed capital investments at its <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> operations could not be made and that anti-competitive practices would result if <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is successful in its $ 3.8 billion takeover attempt. The testimony came in the opening day of a hearing on Great Northern's request for an injunction to block the unfriendly takeover. Great Northern claims antitrust laws would be violated if the two forest products companies merged. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eginton </PERSON> set aside 14 days for the hearing. The chairman of Great Northern, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Laidig </PERSON>, testified about the Norwalk-based company's plans for $ 2.5 billion in capital investments and acquisitions in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> over the next five years. Laidig, during questioning by the company's attorney, said <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> would be so laden with debt if it were successful in the takeover that it could not possibly carry out the capital plans. The takeover would result in anti-competitive practices in southern pulpwood markets and in the national market for paper used in personal bank checks, Great Northern also asserted. <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive officer, <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>, said outside the courtroom that the projected cash flow after a merger of the two companies would be adequate `` even in a financial crisis'' to finance needed capital expenditures. `` It's an old-fashioned combination of two strong industrial companies,'' <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> said, calling Great Northern's claims `` transparent nonsense.'' `` There is no junk debt involved,'' he said. Great Northern has calculated the resulting debt would total $ 4.5 billion. Attorneys for Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> said a merger would increase efficiency. As of Friday, 73.4 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> stockholders tendered their shares under <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 63-a-share offer, <PERSON> Stapleton </PERSON> said. The takeover battle is also being waged in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, where Great Northern is incorporated. <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> is challenging anti-takeover provisions in Great Northern's bylaws, as well as <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>'s corporate takeover law, which forces hostile suitors to wait five years before merging with a targeted company.

<HEAD>Judge Lifts Ban on Pennzoil Suits</HEAD>

 A federal judge in <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s suit over <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s alleged clandestine takeover attempt lifted restrictions Wednesday on <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION>'s ability to file countersuits in other courts. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Thelton </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> refused to extend an order imposed by another federal judge Dec. 7 that prohibited <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> from suing anywhere on related issues without approval of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> federal court. <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> noted that <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> had denied any intention of suing, said <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION>'s claims to the contrary were based on speculation, and added that the local court had the power to prevent inconsistent rulings even if other suits were filed elsewhere. The decision was a skirmish in <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION>'s battle to force <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> to sell its newly acquired $ 2.1 billion, 8.8 percent share of <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION>'s stock and prohibit it from buying more stock without court approval. San Francisco-based <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> also is seeking to validate the anti-takeover measures its directors took around the time of the disclosure of <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION>'s purchases three weeks ago. <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, said it was using $ 2.1 billion of its $ 2.6 billion net proceeds from a settlement of its suit with <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> as a long-term investment in <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> for tax purposes. <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> said it might invest the other $ 500 million in <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> stock but denied any intention of a takeover of the nation's fourth-largest oil company But <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION>, citing <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION>'s past attempts to acquire oil property, contended the rival firm intended a hostile merger or a forced restructuring. <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION>'s suit accuses <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> of violating federal laws requiring advance notice and a 30-day waiting period before major stock purchases by anyone but a passive long-term investor. <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION>, saying <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION>'s suit is based on unfounded suspicions, has asked <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> to dismiss the case. A ruling is pending. Wednesday's decision involved an order <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> obtained Dec. 7 from Chief U.S. District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON> forbidding suits by <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> without approval from the local court. <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> would inevitably sue to challenge the restrictions on takeovers, and argued that restrictions were needed to avoid inconsistent decisions.

<HEAD>Report That Bids Are Low Causes Hilton Stock Price To Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotels </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> stock plunged Wednesday on a report that offers for the hotel-casino company are in the $ 90 range instead of the $ 120 some analysts had believed <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> would fetch. <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION>, which was put up for sale last summer after the settlement of a dispute over the estate of founder <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON>, fell $ 6.87 -LCB- to close at $ 82.87 -LCB- a share on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The Wall Street Journal reported that <ORGANIZATION> JMB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a Chicago-based pension fund manager, had offered about $ 90 a share for <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION>, which would bring the total offer to $ 4.3 billion. Hilton general counsel <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lebo </PERSON> declined to comment on the report. Another of the bidders for <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> is <ORGANIZATION> Miller-Klutznick-Davis-Gray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, billionaire investor <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' Denver-based real estate vehicle. The Journal reported that <PERSON> Miller-Klutznick </PERSON> was bidding about the market price for the stock, which was about $ 90 before the Journal report Wednesday. Calls to Miller-Klutznick and <ORGANIZATION> JMB </ORGANIZATION> were not returned. <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> stock was trading at $ 63 per share when <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Barron </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON>, settled the estate dispute in May In August, <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> stock soared to $ 112 a share on reports that the company would consider at least two formal buyout bids. At that time, some analysts were estimating that shareholders were likely to get $ 120 per share if <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> was sold and possibly as much as $ 140. But the collapse of the junk bond market and fears of a recession have made it much harder to complete takeovers recently, and the stock price has gradually fallen as no deal was announced. <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> had its best year ever in 1987, when profits rose 43 percent and earnings were $ 5.59 per share. Earnings fell to $ 2.72 per share last year and have remained relatively flat this year, rising 2 percent in the July-September quarter to $ 28.1 million, or 57 cents a share.
