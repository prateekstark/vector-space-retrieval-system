 U2, the Irish rock group with a passion for politics, picked up two Grammys Wednesday for `` The <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> <PERSON> Tree </PERSON>,'' their 12-million selling album, and declared, `` This is just a beginning.'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> won record of the year honors for `` Graceland,'' the title track from his South African-inflected album which was the Grammy album of the year last year. But Little <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> upstaged everyone as he hijacked the nationally televised ceremony for several frantic moments, declaring that he had won the Grammy for best new artist. `` I have never received nuthin' _ y' all never gave me no Grammys, and I've been singing for years,'' declared the man who sang `` Tutti Frutti'' and `` Good Golly, Miss Molly. `` I am the architect of rock' n' roll,'' he shouted, and the crowd roared approval. After again announcing that he had, in fact, won the award, <PERSON> Little </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> revealed the Academy's choice _ <PERSON> Jody </PERSON> <PERSON> Whatley </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> sound-alike from the old dance band, <LOCATION> Shalamar </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> <PERSON> Houston </PERSON>, a winner two years ago with her debut album, took honors at the 30th Annual Grammy Awards for best female pop vocalist for her effervescent single, `` I Wan na Dance with Somebody,'' from her LP, `` Whitney.'' <PERSON> Narada </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Walden </PERSON> won a Grammy for producing `` Whitney.'' <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON> won a combined male and female rock vocalist category with `` Tunnel of Love.'' `` Somewhere Out There,'' a sweet ballad written by veteran songwriters <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Horner </PERSON>, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Weil </PERSON> for the animated film `` An American Tail,'' won as song of the year. `` We wrote it for the mice,'' <PERSON> Weill </PERSON> said. Guitarist The Edge, born <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, pulled out a list as he accepted the Grammy for best rock group with vocal `` The <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> <PERSON> Tree </PERSON>.'' He thanked luminaries such as <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dylan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jimi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrix </PERSON>, Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, Dr. <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Westheimer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> the Cat, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and college radio stations. After `` <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> <PERSON> Tree </PERSON>'' won as album of the year, lead singer <PERSON> Bono </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hewson </PERSON> -RRB- quipped, `` It's really hard to carry the weight of the world on your shoulders.'' `` We do n't see this as a peak for U2,'' <PERSON> Bono </PERSON> said backstage. `` It's just a beginning. We've got 12 songs ready for the next album.'' U2, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Houston </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lobos </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> each had four nominations this year, but none threatened threatened to equal <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s eight-award sweep in the 1984 ceremony. And none had a prayer of overtaking Sir <PERSON> Georg </PERSON> <PERSON> Solti </PERSON>, conductor of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION>, whose recording of <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON>'s 9th Symphony won a Grammy for best orchestral recording and raised his lifetime total to 26 <ORGANIZATION> Grammys </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON>, the pianist who had 20 Grammys entering the ceremonies, won two more for best classical instrumental performance and best classical album for `` <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>.'' He also received the President's Special Merit Award from the Academy. `` I am so very happy the classical music still has an appreciation,'' the fiery pianist told the crowd as he accepted the special award. After he won the best album award, he simply smiled and carried it away, saying nothing. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s `` Bad'' album won an early Grammy, for best-produced non-classical recording for producers <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Swedien </PERSON> and <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Gatica </PERSON>. Ladysmith Black Mambazo, the South African vocal group featured on <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s `` Graceland'' album, won a Grammy for themselves for best traditional folk recording for `` <PERSON> Shaka </PERSON> <PERSON> Zulu </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>'s recording of requiems by <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Faure </PERSON> and <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Durufle </PERSON> with the <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chorus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orchestra </ORGANIZATION> won Grammys for best engineered classical recording and for producer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>.

 About 200 people staged a candlelight march at <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday night to protest as racist a student newspaper's criticism of a black professor. Members of <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION>'s Afro-American Society and others marched down the <ORGANIZATION> Ivy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> school's Fraternity Row without incident and held a moment of silence on the campus green in the protest aimed at the <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION>. The demonstration came a day after a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit filed against the school by three former students involved in a 1986 sledgehammer attack on anti-apartheid shanties. The former students wanted their college records cleared and the school barred from `` intimidating or interfering'' with The <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> and staff members of the conservative student weekly. In 1986, 12 students, mostly Review staffers, took sledgehammers to symbolic anti-apartheid shanties on the campus green. The raid, hours after a service marking the birthday of <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, sparked a semester of turmoil. Racial tensions were revived last week with the Review's stinging written attack on a black professor who once sued the newspaper for libel Four Review staffers now are charged by the school with harassing professor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> after confronting him in his classroom over the article, which criticized a music course he teaches and his ability as a professor. Critics of the Review also plan a larger rally on Thursday. Three former Review staffers involved in the 1986 incident said the shanty attack constituted `` symbolic speech'' similar to that of the group that erected the shanties to protest <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> investments in companies doing business in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. On Tuesday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Shane </PERSON> <PERSON> Devine </PERSON> dismissed the lawsuit, deciding that the students failed to prove that their rights were violated. The suit was filed by <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> <PERSON> of </PERSON> <PERSON> Keene </PERSON>, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Reichel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Polenz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Katonah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and the company that publishes the Review. The four Review staffers now charged with harassing <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> face a college disciplinary hearing on Tuesday and possible expulsion. The staffers say are being persecuted for taking strong stands on the quality of <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> life and education, and deny that race is a factor. The <ORGANIZATION> Afro-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> believes the Review contributes to racial problems at <LOCATION> Dartmouth </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Delta Air Lines Case Against U.S. Government Begins</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>' suit blaming federal agencies for the fiery crash of a <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> jet that killed 137 people went to trial Tuesday with both sides accusing the other of negligence. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> crew played Russian roulette with the lives of their passengers,'' said <PERSON> Kathlynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Fadely </PERSON>, a government attorney, during opening arguments in the complex case. Flight 191 crashed and exploded into flames Aug. 2, 1985, as it headed toward a <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> runway during a storm. The 137 dead included the driver of a car that was hit as the plane plunged downward. Twenty-five people were injured. In his opening statement, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said the government is to blame, arguing that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> tower and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sevice </ORGANIZATION> failed to warn the flight crew of the severity of a weather system at the airport. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> flight happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time and air traffic control completely broke down at D-FW when the crash occured. But <PERSON> Fadely </PERSON> said the crew did n't listen to warnings from the control tower and flew into the storm system. A report by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> concluded that the crash was caused, in part, by the pilot's decision to fly into a wind shear, a violent downdraft. The trial of <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>'s claims against the government, delayed six months from its original date, seeks to determine who is to blame for the crash and may also decide how much can be recovered in damages. The decision also will determine whether the government must pay part of $ 91.2 million in claims that <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>'s insurers have paid so far in connection with the crash. In December, about 90 lawsuits filed by individuals against <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> were parceled out from federal court in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> to other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District courts. Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Belew </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> ruled that lawsuits filed by passengers' families will be sent back to the courts where they were originally filed. About half of those 90 suits have been settled. The non-jury trial between the airline and the government could last up to three months and could include testimony from any of 550 potential fact and expert witnesses named by the two sides.

 Government leaders concerned about <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s battered image abroad are arguing increasingly in favor of barring journalists from the occupied territories after nearly three months of violent protests there Most of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 24 Cabinet ministers support closing the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> to journalists as long as the unrest persists, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said after attending a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> session where the issue was raised this week. Closing areas to reporters `` is done in various countries around the world where confrontations of this sort take place,'' said Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>. `` If it becomes clear that indeed it may limit the damage, I would be willing to consider it,'' he said. The executive committee of <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc voted unanimously Monday evening that journalists should be banned from entering the territories. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> army commander Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Amram </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitzna </PERSON> reissued instructions to field commanders to close areas to reporters for several hours if they believe it is necessary to keep or restore calm, army officials told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on condition of anonymity. But <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s government partner, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> of the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, warned against further restrictions. `` If we were to close off the area, in my opinion, rumors of atrocities would be spread around the world that we would not be able to refute,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is an open society and a free society and even if -LRB- journalists -RRB- are not always pleasant, we have to allow them to fulfill their jobs,'' he told reporters Tuesday. Other officials oppose closing the territories on the grounds that such a move might fuel comparisons between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, an issue about which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has been particularily sensitive. South African police, like <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> army officers, have the discretion to declare an area closed to media on the spot because of unrest. Journalists then are barred from entry and must leave if already there. <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>'s bureau chief <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers seized videotape last week from a crew which photographed a Palestinian hanging dead from a pole in the village of <LOCATION> Qabatiyeh </LOCATION> after his neighbors lynched him because he was suspected of collaborating with the Israelis. The army was criticized afterward for failing to rescue the Palestinian. <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON> said the soldiers detained the CNN crew for three hours and refused to return the videotape, saying it contained material damaging to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s security. The Israeli military command said Tuesday that `` our policy is to keep the administered territories open to journalists. However there are exceptions to the rule in isolated incidents where certain troublesome areas can be closed.'' The latest debate over media access was triggered by a <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> report last week that showed four Israeli soldiers beating two captive Palestinians. The two were beaten for more than half an hour while a <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> cameraman photographed it surreptitiously. After the footage was broadcast, embassies in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> received many complaints and Jewish communities abroad also expressed concern, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials said. The four soldiers are being investigated, the army said. The CBS office in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> has received anonymous threatening telephone calls, said <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> bureau chief <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Plantinga </PERSON>. `` One more incident like the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> film and the territories will be closed to journalists,'' a government official told The <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> met Monday with a delegation from the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and said most Cabinet ministers supported blocking journalists from entering the territories but he did not, according to <ORGANIZATION> FPA </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Slater </PERSON>. `` The voices in favor of closing the territories have become much louder than the others,'' <PERSON> Slater </PERSON> said. `` It appears more likely than ever before that such a step will be taken and the <ORGANIZATION> FPA </ORGANIZATION> is increasingly worried.'' Two Israeli newspapers, the left-wing <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamishmar </PERSON> and the independent Maariv, ran editorials Tuesday criticizing discussions in government circles about closing the territories to journalists. `` Without media in the territories we may live in a warm comfortable bubble next to an erupting volcano,'' <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamishmar </PERSON> said. `` But we will be caught by surprise and off guard when the lava overflows and threatens our very existence.''

<HEAD>Chinese Crush Tibetan Monks' Peaceful Dissent</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Chinese authorities have crushed efforts at peaceful dissent by the nationalist monks of <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> as swiftly as they did last year's bold and violent protests by the <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> holy men. Hundreds of monks boycotted the opening of a prayer festival, in the first major clash of wills since at least 14 people were killed in a demonstration Oct. 1. By the second day, however, a major monastery that led the boycott yielded to Chinese pressure and sent more than 200 monks to the festival, other monks reported. Official media had called the gathering a sign of normality in the troubled Himalayan region. `` The monks did n't want to come,'' one holy man whispered at the <ORGANIZATION> Jokhang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> in central <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION>, where the prayer festival began last Thursday and continued this week. They finally did, he said, because `` they were afraid _ afraid that the police will grab them.'' He glanced over his shoulder at an approaching plainclothes policeman, one of dozens patrolling the temple. Fear remains the primary legacy of the three pro-independence demonstrations led by monks over a two-week period in September and October in <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION>, the mile-high Tibetan capital whose name means `` holy ground.'' The monks dispute <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s claim to sovereignty and want independence under the leadership of their exiled god-king, the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>. Chinese authorities have removed all remnants of a police station near the <ORGANIZATION> Jokhang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> that was burned Oct. 1 by hundreds of angry monks and lay Tibetans, prompting police to fire on the crowd. A new stone building is being built on the site. Military roadblocks have been removed from outside the three main monasteries in the <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> area _ Sera, <LOCATION> Drepung </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ganden </LOCATION> _ and police who were billeted inside the monasteries have been withdrawn. Plainclothes Chinese agents now keep watch. All but 15 of the 80 people arrested during the protests have been released from jail after repenting, according to official reports. The prayer festival, called Moinlam Qenmo, has been held at <ORGANIZATION> Jokhang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> every year since 1409 except for the period 1960-85, when it was banned by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. It gathers monks from the <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> area for eight days of continuous prayer and is one of the the most important Tibetan <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> events. As a precaution, <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> sent the highest-ranking Tibetan <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> leader in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> Panchen </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, to <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> in early February to persuade monks to cooperate. He is regarded as second in prestige only to the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, who fled to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> nine years after the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> army entered <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> in 1950. `` The <PERSON> Panchen </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> said ` Do n't demonstrate,''' said a 20-year-old monk at the <LOCATION> Sera </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monastery </LOCATION>, whose whitewashed stone buildings cling to a mountainside on the southern fringe of the city. `` Some -LRB- monks -RRB- said OK, but some were quiet, did n't answer,'' he said, gathering his blood-red robes against a chill wind. Their answer came Thursday, when fewer than 600 showed up in <LOCATION> Jokhang </LOCATION>'s silk-draped central courtyard for the opening of the prayer festival, which attracted more than 1,000 monks last year. Those attending quickly spread the word: `` Not one monk from <LOCATION> Ganden </LOCATION> is here.'' A monk from <PERSON> Sera </PERSON> said the holy men of <LOCATION> Ganden </LOCATION> stayed away because `` the situation is not good. Too many Chinese are here; too many police.'' Other monks said the same. <PERSON> Sera </PERSON> and <PERSON> Drepung </PERSON> sent fewer monks than usual, and those who remained at <LOCATION> Drepung </LOCATION> conducted their own, small-scale prayer festival. `` We're afraid of the police,'' said one boycotter at <LOCATION> Drepung </LOCATION>. `` It's a very big festival, but if we make a small mistake we will be in trouble.'' In addition to plainclothes officers inside, uniformed police were stationed every few yards around the whitewashed stone <ORGANIZATION> Jokhang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>, which is the size of a city block. Several policemen watched from the roof of a nearby police building and others photographed foreign visitors, some of the few allowed into <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> since the protests last year. The <LOCATION> Ganden </LOCATION> monks finally arrived quietly Thursday night from their home on a holy mountain 35 miles west of <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION>. Their presence brought to nearly 800 the number of monks who sat cross-legged most of the day in the stone courtyard, chanting. A stream of pilgrims, including herdsmen in tattered furs, edged around the courtyard and spooned offerings of butter into lamps that flickered in racks along the wall. Tibetan sources and Westerners who have seen previous festivals said there were fewer pilgrims, as well as monks, this year. One Tibetan said <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION>'s population of 40,000 usually doubled with the influx of monks and pilgrims during <PERSON> Moinlam </PERSON> <PERSON> Qenmo </PERSON>. No count of pilgrims was available because most stay only a few days and sleep in the streets. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s official media said festival attendance was up, from 1,100 monks and pilgrims last year to more than 2,300. Dozens of Chinese reporters wrote of the event and the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> quoted local authorities as saying: `` Last year's riot has not had any impact on the ceremony.'' Monks who stayed behind at the the <LOCATION> Ganden </LOCATION> monastery, which was leveled by radicals during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution and is only partially restored, were not allowed to talk freely to visitors. Of more than a dozen monks interviewed at the <ORGANIZATION> Jokhang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> and at <LOCATION> Sera </LOCATION>, Drepung and smaller monasteries, none expressed regret for the violence of the protests. All were emphatic in disdain for the Chinese. `` Chinese are no good,'' a 12-year-old novice monk said in English. `` But we are not afraid.'' A lay Tibetan said: `` <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> had its own culture, its own religion, its own border guards. How can they say we are one country?''

 <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> the </PERSON> <PERSON> Red </PERSON>, leader of student revolts in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in the 1960s, jokingly says he was never quite as leftist as his nickname implied. `` They only meant my hair color,'' said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohn-Bendit </PERSON>, referring to his rust-colored hair during an interview in his <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> office. `` I've always been an anti-Communist, more of one than <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>.'' He's now 42 years old and an active member of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s anti-establishment, environmentalist <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> _ the moderate wing _ and publishes a left-leaning regional magazine in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> He ran unsuccessfully for mayor of <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> in 1986 in a purely symbolic move, he said. But he is considering seriously running for <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>'s city council next year. <PERSON> Cohn-Bendit </PERSON> has also become an author. A collection of interviews with other 1960s activists around the world was published in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in September. American activists featured in the book include <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Abbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffmann </PERSON>, leading Yippies of the era, and the Black Panther activist, <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Seale </PERSON>. The book, `` We Loved It So, The Revolution,'' portrays <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> as a Yippie-turned-Yuppie and <PERSON> Seale </PERSON> as hoping for commercial success as a cookbook author. His book is n't the only look back: <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s news media have carried numerous articles on the tumultuous times of 1968. <PERSON> Cohn-Bendit </PERSON> said that he has basically remained true to many views he had 20 years ago. `` I believe that I can still legitimize everything I do from my standpoint in 1968,'' <PERSON> Cohn-Bendit </PERSON> said. As a moderate member of the Greens, <PERSON> Cohn-Bendit </PERSON> favors forming coalitions with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s liberal <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which the <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION>' radical wing opposes. Nor does <PERSON> Cohn-Bendit </PERSON> favor a West German withdrawal from <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, as some of the radicals do. `` West German militarization is more dangerous on its own than embedded in a larger context,'' he said. `` That's the lesson of World War II.'' <PERSON> Cohn-Bendit </PERSON> has always been a figure who defied traditional national, political, and religious labels. He was born in <LOCATION> Montauban </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, on April 4, 1945, the son of German Jews who fled <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s persecution in the 1930s. His parents moved to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> when <PERSON> Cohn-Bendit </PERSON> was 13. In 1961 <PERSON> Cohn-Bendit </PERSON> became a West German citizen. `` I did it only for pragmatical reasons,'' he said. `` I did n't want to serve in the military. Jews whose parents or siblings were persecuted under the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> are by West German law exempted from the country's mandatory military service. <PERSON> Cohn-Bendit </PERSON>, who speaks French and German fluently, said he does n't assign his national identify to either country. As a French citizen, he would have been subject to the military draft in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. `` I'm just me. I'm not German or French,'' he added. `` I do n't need a national definition. <PERSON> Cohn-Bendit </PERSON>'s views have led to occasional flaps with <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>'s Jewish community. In a highly publicized dispute in 1985 he publicly supported the city playhouse in presenting a play by <PERSON> Rainer </PERSON> <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> <PERSON> Fassbinder </PERSON>, which many Jews wanted banned as anti-Semitic. In the Feb. 18 issue of his magazine `` Pflasterstrand,'' <PERSON> Cohn-Bendit </PERSON> described himself as a `` convinced anti-Zionist.'' In the interview, he said he favored the existence of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> but also a separate <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state and `` a limitation of Zionism.'' Tenants' housing rights and terrorist amnesty are among other issues that have made <PERSON> Cohn-Bendit </PERSON> a household name. But the era that propelled the activist to world fame, the 1960s, is a topic <PERSON> Cohn-Bendit </PERSON> said he no longer wants to talk a lot about. In his book, originally published in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, he writes that people have used him `` like a machine that turns back time.'' <PERSON> Cohn-Bendit </PERSON> captured world attention as a university student in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, at a time when youth protests were rocking the globe. He was a spokesman for students whose demands included greater social equality and an end to war, in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and elsewhere. <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> the </PERSON> <PERSON> Red </PERSON> became the leader of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>' tumultuous _ and occasionally bloody _ student revolts. `` We had the will to change our lives, to participate in history right at the moment it happened,'' <PERSON> Cohn-Bendit </PERSON> writes of his revolutionary days. In May 1968 French authorities expelled him from the country on grounds of disturbing the peace. The ban was not officially lifted until 1978, <PERSON> Cohn-Bendit </PERSON> wrote in his book. <PERSON> Cohn-Bendit </PERSON> lives with his girl friend, but he said he does n't intend to get married

<HEAD>Colon Cancer Risk Tied To Acid Rain Pollutants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Elevated rates of colon cancer in the nation's <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> and north-central region may be due to an acid rain pollutant that absorbs sunlight, impairing the body's ability to make vitamin D, reseachers say Preliminary studies have suggested that vitamin D and calcium combine to lower the risk of colon cancer. According to the new theory, sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere absorbs ultraviolet rays from the sun that trigger the production of vitamin D in the skin, researchers said at a press conference Tuesday. Sulfur dioxide, produced by the burning of high-sulfur coal, is a principal ingredient of acid rain. A similar effect was observed in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> more than 350 years ago, said the originators of the new theory, said <PERSON> Cedric </PERSON> <PERSON> Garland </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> and his brother, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. Around 1629, Londoners began burning high-sulfur coal from <LOCATION> Newcastle </LOCATION>, they said. Within a short time, children began exhibiting the leg malformations characteristic of rickets _ a vitamin D deficiency disease. Vitamin D aids the absorption of calcium, and calcium and vitamin D together appear to lower the risk of colon cancer, the Garlands said. Dr. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Lipkin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center said the Garlands' theory `` is a legitimate theory'' and work is in progress to clarify the role of vitamin D and calcium in colon cancer. `` We're looking into how many individuals might be benefited by calcium _ and the degree to which they might be,'' said <PERSON> Lipkin </PERSON>. Two years ago, he showed that calcium supplements could change the growth of cells in the colons of people at high risk of colon cancer and might therefore lower colon cancer risk. An authority on diet and cancer, <PERSON> Regina </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziegler </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, cautioned that because this was only a theory, people should not begin taking vitamin D supplements to protect against colon cancer. `` People have trouble distinguishing theories from proven effects,'' she said. `` With evidence such as this, you certainly do n't want to start taking large doses of vitamin <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vitamin </PERSON> D in high doses can be hazardous to your health.'' The Garlands' explanation is not the only theory to explain why colon cancer rates are highest in the north-central and northeastern states. `` Other people have hypothesized that increased exercise, increased fruit and vegetable intake and differences in drinking water may lead to the lower incidence in the South,'' said <PERSON> Ziegler </PERSON>. The Garlands cautioned that people should not spend more time in the sun to increase their vitamin D production because exposure to sunlight increases the risk of skin cancer. They suggested instead that people eat foods high in vitamin D, which include anchovies, sardines, salmon and tuna. Milk is fortified with vitamin D, but most other dairy products are not, they said. Breast cancer also occurs at an increased rate in the areas where colon cancer is highest, and the Garlands suggested that breast cancer, too, might be indirectly related to sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere. That theory is more speculative than the colon cancer theory, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Garland </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> Courtney </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> became the fourth Texan in a row to win the Miss <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> crown Tuesday, besting Miss <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in the nationally televised pageant. `` It feels fabulous,'' Ms. <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON>, 21, said moments after being crowned by her predecessor and fellow Texan, <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Royer </PERSON>. `` One of the gifts <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> gave me was a dictionary with the word ` impossible' whited out. So of course it was possible.'' Ms. <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, won the right to compete in the Miss Universe pageant May 23 in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Royer </PERSON>, of <PERSON> Keller </PERSON>, came in third in last year's worldwide competition, which was won by Miss <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>. The blue-eyed brunette, a junior in advertising and public relations at <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, won over <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Magana </PERSON>, 22, of Rancho <PERSON> Palos </PERSON> <PERSON> Verdes </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, the first runner-up. Miss <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Stacy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sacco </PERSON> said she was stunned by the fourth Miss <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> victory in a row. `` What are the odds?'' she said. Second runner-up was Miss <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Rampy </PERSON>, 24, followed by <LOCATION> Miss </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Monica </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruni </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>, 23, and Miss <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Michele </PERSON> <PERSON> Richmond </PERSON>, 20. Soon after the beaming new Miss <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> ascended her throne, the last three title holders posed with her for photographers. Ms. <PERSON> Royer </PERSON>'s predecessor, <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> <PERSON> Fichtner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, called the last four winners `` four aces in a deck of cards.'' The woman who started the string, <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez-Herring </PERSON> of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, said: `` It's always been known <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> is full of beautiful women, and this just proves it. I just feel sorry for the next Miss <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.'' Actress <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> <PERSON> Scoggins </PERSON> and actor <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Thicke </PERSON> served as co-hosts for the program, televised by <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>. Ten semifinalists, who had been chosen last week, were announced as the pageant opened Tuesday night. The pageant capped three bizarre weeks in which two contestants quit because of police records, animal-rights activists protested the awarding of fur coats and the co-host, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Scoggins </PERSON>, was attacked in a hotel elevator. The hosts made no mention of the various problems during the television show. The late departures of two contestants, both from <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, opened a spot for <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, 20, of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, but the lateness meant she arrived about a week after the other contestants. `` Actually, I've found this oddball situation to be quite an advantage,'' she said before the pageant opened. `` Having so short a time to pull myself together, getting all my clothes together, finding a fur coat, dropping everything _ when all the other girls had months to prepare. It shows off my abilities.'' Miss <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> was not among the 10 semifinalists.

 Besides a mink jacket and full-length coat worth a total of $ 15,000, <ORGANIZATION> Miss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> wins a $ 25,000 personal appearance contract, $ 46,000 cash, a sports car, $ 10,000 worth of jewelry and other prizes, including a portable home tanning center. About 25 animal-rights activists picketed Tuesday outside the <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> to protest the awarding of the furs to the winner. Members of the <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruces </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, chapters of <ORGANIZATION> Sangre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cristo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> contend fur ranching and trapping are cruel to the animals. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Sangre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cristo </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruces </LOCATION> chapter, had asked <PERSON> Thicke </PERSON> to do as longtime host <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> had done earlier: resign in protest over the awarding of the furs. <PERSON> Thicke </PERSON> refused, saying the furs were taken from ranch-raised minks that had been treated humanely. He and <PERSON> Young </PERSON> released a joint statement Monday saying they agreed that fur-trapping is cruel but disagreed on fur-ranching. In another prepageant incident, a man accused of attempted sexual assault in the attack on Miss <PERSON> Scoggins </PERSON> last week was released on $ 100 bail. Prosecutors usually ask for $ 15,000 bail in third-degree felonies like attempted sexual assaults. A man ripped Miss <PERSON> Scoggins </PERSON>' dress and shoved her into the back of a hotel elevator, authorities said. She fought the man off and a man was arrested at the hotel. The man's bail was later raised to $ 100,000, which he posted. Another person connected with the pageant has a date with the law. <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitman </PERSON>, Miss Kentucky-USA, is awaiting trial on drunken-driving charges. Two other contestants with arrest records, both from <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and both accused of shoplifting, elected to bow out. The original Miss Minnesota-USA, <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolich </PERSON>, resigned after it was disclosed she'd been accused of shoplifting $ 370 worth of clothing. Her replacement, first runner-up <PERSON> Jolene </PERSON> <PERSON> Stavrakis </PERSON>, quit after disclosing she had pleaded no contest to stealing from a store in March 1986. The first Miss USA pageant was in 1952 in <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>.

 Three-fourths of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders who will be national convention delegates are not yet supporting any of the presidential candidates as the initial round of primaries and caucuses draws to a close, an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> survey found. Since late last year, the candidates together have attracted support that will add up to fewer than three dozen votes at the convention, according to the survey, in which hundreds of the party's `` super delegates'' were contacted. And despite the months of debates and the weeks of primaries and caucuses, many of the automatic delegates, who include <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> members, <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> governors and others, are not closing in on which candidate they plan to suppport. `` The more I hear, the more uncommitted I become,'' said <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Moss </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member from <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the winner of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary, leads the pack with commitments totaling just 31.5 votes at the convention. By comparison, the runaway favorite so far is `` uncommitted,'' a category in which delegates with 247.65 votes at the convention place themselves, the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> survey found. Missouri Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, winner of the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses, is next behind <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with commitments amounting to 21 votes at the convention, followed by <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> with 19.55, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> with 16.55 and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> with 15.5. Only <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, who has acknowledged his chances of winning the Democratic nomination are remote at best, has not received a commitment from any of the delegates contacted by the AP. When added to delegates won by the candidates in the primaries and caucuses so far, that brings the total to 63.5 for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, 47 for <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, 35.5 for <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, 27.55 for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, 16.55 for <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and none for <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>. A total of 258.65 are counted as uncommitted. The survey, conducted during the last two weeks of February, indicates that the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses and the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary, along with nearly weekly debates, have made little impression on <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders. The survey found that just 35.25 more convention votes have been won by the candidates since a similar <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> survey late last year. `` I'm still not convinced that <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> are representative of the cross section of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> party chairman <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Pick </PERSON>. `` Call over to the grammar school and talk to any first-grader _ he knows just as much as I do,'' said J.T. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> DNC </ORGANIZATION> member from <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>. `` It's up for grabs. I'm just sitting back enjoying it.'' That's not what the <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> campaign had hoped to hear after the victory in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. `` I think we expected a bigger bounce,'' said <PERSON> Jude </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> campaign aide who works on delegate selection. `` We would like people to commit sooner, but we're encouraged by what they're telling us. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutcheson </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> campaign aide involved in delegate selection, said he is not surprised to see the super delegates holding back. `` These are political people; they want to wait and see what the voters in the primaries decide and then they will exercise their judgment,'' he said. However, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said party leaders may feel some incentive to begin committing themselves after next week's Super Tuesday contests, when nearly one-third of the party's delegates are at stake. `` At that point I think that people start looking at the calendar,'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said. `` People who come in after <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> -LRB- which holds an April 19 primary -RRB- are really going to be seen as coming late to the party.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> allots 362 convention votes to members of its national committee, some of whom will cast only fractions of votes. An additional 25 votes are given to governors of states and territories and five to former leaders, including former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>, a former vice president who was the party's nominee in 1984. Delegates representing 352.75 convention votes were contacted for the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> survey in February. An additional 253 delegate slots will be awarded to Democratic members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in April. The Republican Party makes no such provision for automatic delegates, awarding all the seats to its national convention through the primaries and caucuses. In all, 4,162 delegates are to attend the Democratic National Convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> July 18-21, and 2,082 are needed to win the presidential nomination.

 That masterpiece of music comedy and nostalgic Americana, `` The Music Man,'' suffered from a lack of strong, clear singing as the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION> opened its annual season of musical comedy. The acting, directing, dancing and scenery were first-rate Tuesday at the New York State Theater. But some of the verve and excitement of those glorious, fast-paced songs was lost during the first act as the singing did not carry well over the orchestra. The problem was alleviated after intermission. Perhaps it was the shift to mostly ballads, or perhaps the level of the singers' microphones had been boosted, but Act 2 was the rich, delightful experience one hopes the whole show will be for the rest of its run through April 10 <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunton </PERSON>, debuting with the company as <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, had the most trouble. A Broadway performer, he moves as gracefully as a dancer and sold his `` 76 Trombones'' to the folks of <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> with more charm than brass. But his light voice did n't project in Act 1's `` Ya Got Trouble'' and `` The Sadder but Wiser Girl.'' The female chorus also was difficult to understand in `` Pick-a-Little, Talk-a-Little,'' and the townspeople blurred the words of joyful anticipation in `` The Wells Fargo Wagon.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Burdick </PERSON>, smaller than most boys who play the lisping <PERSON> Winthrop </PERSON>, also is no belter, and did n't get his words across the footlights. Opera singers learn to project their voices and they came out best, making themselves understood and never sounding too operatic for the music. <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON> <PERSON> Munro </PERSON> was a pretty and sympathetic <PERSON> Marian </PERSON> the librarian, <PERSON> Muriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Costa-Greenspon </PERSON> a natural leader of ladies as the mayor's wife, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> McKee </PERSON> as the pompous mayor, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Billings </PERSON> as <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>'s cohort, <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> <PERSON> Almy </PERSON> as <PERSON> Marian </PERSON>'s mother and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Ledbetter </PERSON> as the constable. The dancing chorus was splendid, with choreography by <PERSON> Marcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Milgrom </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodge </PERSON>, making her company debut. There's a generous amount of dancing, in the library, in rehearsals for a `` social,'' in the center of town several times. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>' set of business buildings pulled back to give the dancers room. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Marlay </PERSON>'s costumes for 1912 were glorious, from feathered hats to peppermint suits for the four school board members who squabbled every minute they were n't harmonizing `` <LOCATION> Lida </LOCATION> Rose. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Pippin </PERSON>, a Broadway conductor, was conducting at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION> for the first time. It was wonderful to hear the overture played by a big orchestra, less wonderful later when words were covered. The late <PERSON> Meredith </PERSON> <PERSON> Willson </PERSON> wrote the book, music and lyrics. He and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacey </PERSON> wrote the plot, which came out as a memory of bygone innocent days of <LOCATION> Mason </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Willson </PERSON> grew up. One wonderful song follows another _ `` Goodnight, My Someone,'' `` My White Knight,'' `` Till There Was You'' _ and the audience greeted each gem like a reunion with a long-lost best friend.

<HEAD>Administration Officials Praise Fed Monetary Policies</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is trying to soften earlier accusations that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s tight monetary policies are nudging the country toward a recession. In separate forums, a trio of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials said Tuesday they believe the nation's central bank is doing a good job of supplying money to the economy. Just a few weeks ago, administration officials worried about the prospect of a recession during an election year had been complaining that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> was n't pumping enough new money into the economy. On Tuesday, however, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that he has `` absolutely no disagreement'' with the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s monetary policy. Speaking at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, Budget Director <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said, `` There seems to be a little bit of easing, and I welcome that.'' And at a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economists </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s chief economic adviser, said the administration is `` supportive of present policy as well as the plans for the future'' the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> revealed last week. The suddenly conciliatory administration tone follows a sharp counterattack by <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, who had responded to the administration complaints with some pointed remarks of his own. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said that a looser monetary policy could spark higher inflation. He also said pressure by the administration could push the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> into asserting its independence by doing the opposite of what the White House wanted. The administration began pulling back from its criticisms last week. <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON> said he supports the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s policies so far in 1988, and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said at his news conference last Wednesday that he had confidence in <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, whom he appointed to the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> job last summer. The central bank can usually increase the flow of credit by easing interest rates. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told the senators Tuesday that when it comes to finding the balance between keeping interest rates low and avoiding inflation, `` I think the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is doing that and doing a very good job of that.'' In other testimony, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> played down concerns raised by senators about the growth of the national debt. Projections by the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, cited at the hearing, are that the national debt could reach $ 4 trillion by 1993. The debt was below $ 1 trillion when <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took office in 1981. `` There are some risks in the growth of debt of this magnitude, but I think they tend to be overstated,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` I think to some extent that's a consequence of the fact that we're moving into 1988, which happens to be an election year.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> also said, however, that `` an increase in the debt is not a development about which this administration nor the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> can be very happy.''

 The head of <ORGANIZATION> Comedie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francaise </ORGANIZATION>, actor and director <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Poulain </PERSON>, died Tuesday night. He was 63. <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Poulain </PERSON> died at his home on the Avenue de l'Opera, near the famed theater he had administered for the past two years. No cause of death was given. `` It is the theater of yesterday and today which can not, tonight, hide its tears,'' Culture Minister <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Leotard </PERSON> said in a statement. `` The curtain of the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Comedie </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- <PERSON> Francaise </PERSON> has fallen on a great voice.'' <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Poulain </PERSON> had been a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Comedie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francaise </ORGANIZATION> since 1979 and was placed in charge in 1986. During his 40-year career in the theater, he acted in and directed dozens of plays from the classics to contemporary pieces. `` With his disappearance, French theater loses one of its most brilliant servants, an inheritor of the tradition of the <ORGANIZATION> Comedie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francaise </ORGANIZATION>, that which runs from <PERSON> Moliere </PERSON> to <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Charron </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Leotard </PERSON>'s statement said. <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Poulain </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Marseille </LOCATION> Sept. 12, 1924, but spent much of his childhood in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, where his father worked. Returning to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> at the age of 19, he studied at the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Conservatory, which he left in 1949 with the first prize in acting. In 1952, he founded his own theater company, directing a variety of plays from <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> to <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Anouilh </PERSON>. <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Poulain </PERSON> was known to the public as both a buffoon and a tragedien, but he received the most acclaim for his portrayals in the plays of <PERSON> Moliere </PERSON>, such as `` Tartuffe'' and `` Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme.'' After taking over the <PERSON> Comedie </PERSON> <PERSON> Francaise </PERSON>, as the candidate proposed by President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Poulain </PERSON> neither acted nor directed. He said he concentrated his time to running the institution _ `` I am the protector of its soul.''

<TEXT>
 Alarmed by a rise in drug production and the violence that goes with it, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is warning <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> that their anti-narcotics programs will receive close scrutiny in the coming months. They were singled out Tuesday in the president's annual drug report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as countries that are making some efforts to stop narcotics traffic but need to improve. They were not classed with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and a new entry on the list, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, as countries whose support for drug trafficking makes them ineligible for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid. <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Wrobleski </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for international narcotics matters, said the message to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is: `` We believe that you're cooperating and you deserve certification, but we want to put an asterisk next to it and we will be watching closely in 1988.'' In the annual report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the president certifies whether countries are doing enough to battle narcotics to deserve <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance and other benefits. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> made the list this year because its military chief and de facto leader, <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, has been indicted by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grand jury on drug conspiracy charges. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is not a major narcotics producing country, but according to <LOCATION> Wrobleski </LOCATION>, `` <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> has been a drug traffickers' and money launderers' haven.'' Putting <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> on the list will have no immediate impact, because the country had lost <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid even before <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s indictment But Tuesday's action does permit further steps by the administration, including some tariffs and tightening of customs rules that could hurt Panamanian exports. Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said he would introduce legislation to go further by imposing a trade embargo on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` The good news is that <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is on the list,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>. `` On the other hand, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> are n't ... I think we have to continue to apply pressure against these countries.'' The president's report faulted <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> for not breaking a cartel of drug dealers and for not fully backing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> requests for extradition of drug suspects wanted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. At the same time, it noted that whatever efforts <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> made in the fight were `` at great peril to its officials.'' It said <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is the largest single source of heroin and marijuana entering the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and officials there need to do more to eradicate opium poppies and deal with allegations of official corruption. Three countries said to be doing little to stop narcotics escaped inclusion on the list due to special `` national security concerns,'' the report said. <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> was kept off the list out of concern that a condemnation would harm <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to win <LOCATION> Laotian </LOCATION> help in accounting for more than 500 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen listed as missing there after the Vietnam War, <PERSON> Wrobleski </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> does n't get <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid anyway. <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> escaped decertification because officials think it would be counter-productive at a time the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is trying to woo that country toward democracy. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> retained its certification because there is n't much the central government can do to stop trafficking and production in regions of the country it does not control. In its estimates of worldwide drug production, the report predicted that coca leaf output would increase from a high of 211,400 metric tons in 1987 to as much as 213,650 metric tons this year. Marijuana production will drop from a high of 17,625 metric tons to 10,100 tons, and opium output will drop from a high of 3,017 metric tons to 2,992 metric tons in 1988, the report said. A metric ton equals 2,200 pounds. Ms. <PERSON> Wrobleski </PERSON> said one of the gloomiest outlooks is for control of coca leaf growth, especially in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, the origin of a vast majority of the world's cocaine. <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> has made some strides in eradicating the crop by sending work crews into the production areas to kill the plants. That's impossible in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, she said, because the growers control the regions In <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, for example, 27 eradication workers have been killed, she said.

<HEAD>In Final Days Before Super Tuesday, Television Ads Get Tougher</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Presidential candidates are turning to increasingly aggressive television advertising in the week before the high-stakes Super Tuesday contests in 20 states and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Samoa </LOCATION>. Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is taking some heat on the Iran-Contra affair from Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> is moving onto the populist turf claimed thus far by Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>. And <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> is continuing his broadside against <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, D-Mo., also is running an ad in which Rep. <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Leath </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> praises him for standing `` with us for lower taxes, for an oil import fee to make <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> strong, for a tough trade bill to stand up for American workers. <PERSON> Leath </PERSON> says <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> oppose all three. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Arlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Schardt </PERSON> said Tuesday it had not been decided yet whether the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator would release his own cache of hard-hitting ads. `` We're prepared for any needs that may arise,'' <PERSON> Schardt </PERSON> said. `` We're considering what other messages we may still want to convey over the next few days.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> did mount an indirect TV challenge to <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> on Tuesday, when he started running three new ads promoting populist themes similar to the ones <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> has adopted. One new ad depicts <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> as a fighter against polluters, price-fixers and big corporations _ exactly the type of anti-establishment image <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> has tried to cultivate. The other two ads feature <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> talking to groups of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oil workers. In one spot he says corporations need to invest in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and create jobs at home, while in the other he tells the workers that `` it's time to put people back to work in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and have the rigs in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> stand idle for a change.'' The `` blame foreigners'' message is strikingly similar to one of <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s strongest ads, the `` <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION>'' spot that helped him win the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses and is now being used across the Super Tuesday states. In that ad the congressman criticizes <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> for putting high import tariffs on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> autos and asks how many Hyundais the Koreans could sell here at $ 48,000 apiece. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> has also revived a highly effective <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> spot, now retooled for Super Tuesday, alleging that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is a tax-raiser and mocking his suggestion that depressed <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> farmers recover by growing Belgian endive. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign was planning to take aim at <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s newly acquired reputation as an anti-establishment crusader and possibly run an ad featuring a swirling weathervane to raise questions about his consistency <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dach </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s communications director, said no final decisions had been made about which ads would be used where and when. But he said the general thrust of the spots is that <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> `` says he is leading the little guy's fight but his campaign is financed and supported by the big guys. His biggest contributors are <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s biggest corporations. He has failed to show a set of principles or a set of values that give a rudder to his policies.'' He said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was also prepared to counter-attack against <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, if necessary. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has commercials on the air in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, the biggest Super Tuesday states, plus <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. His ad campaign was to expand this week into <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, aides said. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., went on the air Tuesday in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> with an ad contrasting his and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s positions on a number of issues, including the Iran-Contra affair The narrator says <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> `` opposed selling arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supported the arms-for-hostages deal.'' The ad also accuses <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of waffling on taxes, taking a soft line on the U.S.-Soviet arms control treaty, and opposing a textile bill popular in several Southern states. Another Dole spot running in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> depicts a man walking through snow but leaving no footprints. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> campaign manager <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> said the message is that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` has held all these big jobs'' yet left no mark. The vice president, in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, called the `` footprints'' commercial `` terribly ineffective.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign refused to disclose any details of how or whether it planned to respond. But the vice president said: `` We're not going to sit out there unprotected ... I think I have every right to set the record straight.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> used a negative ad against <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> last month, but it ran for only a couple of days before the primary. As the Super Tuesday TV campaign grew more heated, Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, questioned <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s judgment in radio ads throughout <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, which holds a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primary on Saturday. The <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> ad asks if the former television evangelist has `` the qualifications and the judgment to be our next president'' and cites some of his more unusual positions such as a 1979 suggestion that public schools be eliminated. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> later changed his mind about that. In addition to negative ads, the candidates are using more traditional biographical spots and political testimonials. Among them: former Sen. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> endorses <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> praises <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, and Rep. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON> _ an elderly <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> legislator with enormous clout among senior citizens _ speaks kindly of <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>. At least two candidates, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, are using Spanish-language ads in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> does the talking himself. `` The governor is fluent in Spanish, so it seemed like the thing to do,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosgrove </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> campaign director. There are 712 Republican delegates and 1,307 Democratic delegates up for grabs on Super Tuesday, March 8. Television is the candidates' major tool in seeking to win them.

<TEXT>
 Academics and business managers from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will team up to study four industrial sites in each country in an effort to develop management guidelines for joint ventures. The study will mark the first time Westerners will be allowed to participate in on-site research of Soviet decision-making methods, project director <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, a professor at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Graduate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday. The study is not aimed at encouraging joint ventures, but to `` make sure the projects that do get started are operated successfully and the combined management teams of Soviet and American managers will be able to work with each other effectively,'' <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> said. Two faculty members from the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> business school and two representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> External </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the research arm of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, will work on the study. The study, scheduled to begin in May and end in September, will include <PERSON> Electrosila </PERSON>, a Leningrad-based manufacturer of heavy industrial equipment. The other sites have not been determined, <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> said. `` We want to prepare guidelines that will help the day-to-day management of joint ventures in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> firms,'' <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> said. `` This could be in any number of fields.'' The research will focus on capital investments, appointing and terminating a middle manager, introducing a new product and formulating and implementing an annual business plan. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> said the choices are a good cross-section of real business decisions. `` They represent quite a range of the kinds of things operating managers do,'' he said. Four case studies based on the research are expected to be completed by November and the final version is scheduled for publication by July 1989. The co-director of the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> team is <PERSON> Charalambos </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlachoutsicos </PERSON>, a research fellow at the school. Co-chairmen of the Soviet team are <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> Faminsky </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> and B.I. <PERSON> Fomin </PERSON>, general director of <LOCATION> Electrosila </LOCATION>. The project will be jointly funded.

Former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, the last Democrat to occupy the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, said he thought the chances were 50-50 that no Democrat would arrive at the party nominating convention with enough delegates to claim the nomination. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sounded confident that nothing of the sort would happen in the Republican race. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in a strong position in virtually all of the Southern states that will vote next week, said, `` I'm convinced that whoever wins Super Tuesday will be the next president.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was further buoyed by the results of a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Post-ABC News poll released Tuesday, showing him with a nearly 3-to-1 lead over <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> among Republicans likely to vote Super Tuesday. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> were battling for the Democratic lead. GOP hopeful <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, meanwhile, said he intends to drop his $ 35 million libel suit against former Rep. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON> rather than go to trial on Super Tuesday. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> has accused <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON> of defaming him in a letter contending that the former television evangelist used the influence of his father, the late Sen. <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, to avoid combat duty in the Korean War. But <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> may not be able to walk away from the suit without paying <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON>'s legal fees. With nearly all the precincts reporting in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>'s `` beauty contest'' primary, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had 49 percent to <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s 39 percent. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> had 5 percent and Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> 3.4 percent. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> rolled to a solid win with 56 percent; <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had 27 percent; <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> 8 percent; <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> 6 percent and <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> 4 percent. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> was not on the ballot. `` We have found the common chord that is linking the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people, whether they are in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said about his impressive showing. The Vermont contest did not involve allocating any delegates to the Republican and Democratic national convention. In contrast, Super Tuesday on March 8 involves 1,307 delegates in <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> primaries and caucuses in 20 states and 712 delegates in 17 contests on the Republican side. The broad sweep of that day's contests means candidates must place greater stress than ever before on costly television commercials. Gone are the days of `` retail politics,'' consisting of six stops in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> in a single day. The new campaign style features chartered jets, trips to two or three regions of two or three different states _ and a heavy dose of commercials scattered across several states. In his new advertisement, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> says that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has refused to say he would veto an increase in income tax rates, that he wo n't support a textile import bill and that he `` supported the arms for hostages deal'' in the Iran-Contra affair `` That's precisely what he did _ he supported the sale of arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>,'' the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> senator said as he campaigned in <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaigned in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, where he said of <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s Iran-Contra comments, `` I support the president. I have nothing to say about <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s charges, nothing at all.'' Instead, he touted his own role in the decision to invade <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in 1983, as well as the part he has played in the administration's anti-drug program. If <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is heavily favored in most Republican Super Tuesday states, the Democratic contest shapes up as a struggle among <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. Ironically, it was a Democratic idea to develop a regional Southern primary, in the hopes that it would give a candidate from the deep South a springboard to the nomination. It has n't worked that way, and <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, who invited <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> to his home in <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, said he is no longer sure whether the idea is good or bad. He added, `` My hope is that out of the primary and caucus season will come a clear winner. I'm not sure that's a likelihood now.'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said he traveled to <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s home in rural <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> `` not to enhance my prospects but to greet an old friend.'' At the same time, he began running a new commercial in which <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Leath </PERSON> says <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> `` stood with us for lower taxes, for an oil import fee to make <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> strong, for a tough new trade bill to stand up for American workers.'' `` On all these issues, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> were opposed to us,'' he says. There was no immediate response from either <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> or <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Among the other Democrats, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, where he met with officials from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> about the recent arrests of black leaders in that country. Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, largely skipping Southern states, campaigned in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> for support in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> caucuses. Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, struggling to survive in the Republican race, said if either <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> or <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> wins the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination, `` the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Revolution is over.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, under pressure for several comments he has made in the past two weeks, said a transcript of 1967 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee testimony supports his belief that there are nuclear missiles in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. He quoted testimony by a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official who said a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> refugee told him of the missiles. `` This is documented evidence,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said.

 An assembly began an 11-day session Tuesday to elect a new president and vice president. The session opened with a 35-page report by President <PERSON> Suharto </PERSON> on the affairs of state since he was re-elected in 1983 for a fourth five-year term. The 1,000-member assembly is expected to re-elect <PERSON> Suharto </PERSON>, a 66-year-old former general and the sole candidate for president. The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consultative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, dominated by the president's governing <ORGANIZATION> GOLKAR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, is a special body summoned every five years The post of vice president, though largely ceremonial, has been the subject of intense speculation in recent weeks because it is likely to be filled by a figure considered to be <PERSON> Suharto </PERSON>'s chosen successor. Two people have been viewed as possible candidates for the vice presidency: State Secretary <PERSON> Sudharmono </PERSON>, 61, <ORGANIZATION> GOLKAR </ORGANIZATION> chairman, and Try Sutrisno, 52, newly appointed armed forces commander, who has served four years as a <PERSON> Suharto </PERSON> aide. In his report to the assembly, <PERSON> Suharto </PERSON> said his administration in the last five years has had to overcome an economic recession and a sharp drop in oil prices, a major source of foreign exchange in <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Suharto </PERSON> also said <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>'s economic growth rate was estimated to reach an average of 3.8 percent annually in the current five-year economic plan ending March 1989. The original target was set at 5 percent. In foreign affairs, the president reaffirmed <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>'s position that it will not normalize relations with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> until <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> pledges it will not provide support to communist guerrillas in the region, including <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION> suspended relations with <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in 1967 after accusing it of complicity in the abortive communist coup attempt of 1965. However, trade relations between the two nations have been restored since the signing of a memorandum of understanding in July 1985.

 <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> will seek a court order to stop the shipment of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> citrus to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and other citrus-producing states, officials say. The move was prompted by a judge's order Tuesday that overturned a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> ban on the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> fruit. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> imposed the ban last month after a federal rule took effect allowing the shipment of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> citrus that meets certain standards to other citrus-producing states.

<HEAD>Expected Budget Surplus Raises Hopes for Tax Cuts</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> steps before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> on March 15, he is expected to unveil one of the rarest of British commodities _ a budget surplus. The expectation is so real that already there is widespread talk of a massive tax cut _ and also widespread criticism of the government's reputed plans for the extra money. `` The budget on March 15 should be the most momentous of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s postwar history,'' the Economist magazine said. Anything could happen in the next two weeks, and the budget may turn out very different from what is now forecast. But for the moment, analysts are assuming a tax cut is in the works, and the government's critics are attacking the budget as a gift to the rich at the expense of the poor. Last autumn the government announced its planned expenditures of $ 278 billion for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1989, and the spring Budget Day is when it discloses how it will raise the money. For the first time in almost 20 years, Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s Conservative government might produce a budget surplus for the current fiscal year, which ends March 31, said a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, who was n't identified, in accordance with British custom. The government expects to out-perform its most recent forecast of a deficit of $ 1.77 billion, which was down from a previously forecast deficit of $ 7.1 billion, the spokesman said. `` It will probably turn out to be a surplus,'' said <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Coyoe </PERSON>, economist for the private forecasting firm <ORGANIZATION> DRI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Europe </ORGANIZATION>. `` Very definitely a surplus,'' said <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, an economist at the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Kleinwort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grieveson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd </ORGANIZATION>. The surplus will be $ 2 billion to $ 5 billion, the economists estimated. If they are right, the surplus will have resulted from the government's tight grip on spending, its buoyant tax receipts and proceeds from its giant and continuing privatization program of selling off to the public billions of dollars' worth of state-owned companies. The surplus has sparked speculation that the government will slash its top income tax rate of 60 percent to 50 percent or even lower in what would be the biggest cut in almost 10 years. The cut, which applies to people earning more than $ 72,900 annually, would be effective in the fiscal year beginning April 1. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said there was much speculation that <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> would cut it below 50 percent. `` We suspect he will want to do those cuts over an extended time period. It will seem like too much of a giveaway -LRB- otherwise -RRB-.'' But the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> might slash the rate to as low as 35 percent, adding: `` The chancellor has been stung by criticisms from his own party that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s tax reforms in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> have overtaken <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> with a simplified system ...'' In her first budget, in June 1979, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> cut the top rate from 83 percent to 60 percent. It has remained unchanged since. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the top federal income tax rate is 33 percent this year, although for most individuals, the maximum rate is 28 percent. <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> also is expected to cut the lowest tax rate, which applies to income up to $ 31,600, to 25 percent from 27 percent. That rate stood at 33 percent in 1979. The expected tax cuts _ part of Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s long-term, sweeping reform of the tax system _ would be highly controversial in a country where the welfare state prevails despite the prime minister's capitalist revolution. `` The government is bracing itself for the charge that ... it will be introducing ` a rich man's budget,''' the Observer newspaper wrote. Critics of Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s tight spending policies already have raised a furor, demanding that surplus money go to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> rather than toward tax cuts. In February, nurses staged a one-day walkout to protest the state of the health service, which has 700,000 people waiting for surgery at state hospitals. Other critics fear that cuts could spur consumer spending enough to ignite inflation and force up interest rates. But Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s supporters say her fiscal policies have helped boost <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s now-strong economy. The budget proposals must be approved by <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, where they are assured passage because of the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s 102-seat majority in the 650-seat House of Commons.

 Republican presidential candidate <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said he would use the military to help stem the flow of illegal drugs into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and would order airplanes suspected of carrying drugs to be shot down. `` If one of those drug planes is flying without giving identification ... coming into this country, I would n't hesitate to give orders to shoot him down,'' the former television evangelist said at a rally Tuesday. `` I believe we have played games long enough with drugs,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think we are being as aggressive as we should.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who has tapped a vein of anti-communist sentiment among Cuban-Americans as he campaigns around <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, also accused Cuban President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> of involvement in drug trafficking. Earlier, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> cited 21-year-old, second-hand testimony before a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee as evidence that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has intermediate-range missiles based in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. He called for closing what he calls a `` Cuban loophole'' in the U.S.-Soviet Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty, which now is awaiting ratification by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` If the INF treaty is ratified without addressing this matter then I think it will be virtually treasonous,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` I do not feel there is any way that they can sweep this thing under the rug. I am not going to permit them to do it.'' Several <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said Tuesday the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> military has some surface-to-surface missiles in its inventory, but none has a nuclear warhead and none could reach the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> even if it did. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> quoted 1967 testimony by <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bethel </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, who said Cuban refugees had told him of seeing missiles, and one of the refugees, identified only as Mr. <PERSON> Apud </PERSON>, who swore <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> soldiers let him know about missiles aimed at <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> before he left in 1966. Neither man testified he had personally seen the missiles, the transcript indicates. The testimony was given to the Judiciary subcommittee to investigate the administration of the Internal Security Act and other internal security laws. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> read portions of it to supporters Tuesday at a breakfast in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> and during a rally the night before in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` I've been accused of bringing funny facts,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> told the <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> gathering. `` Ladies and gentlemen, the clear eyewitness, sworn testimony of witnesses before a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION> is not funny facts. ... This is documented evidence.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s assertion that there are missiles based in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has been denied by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, congressional defense experts and <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, who told <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> on Monday that <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> should `` go and see a doctor, really, or a psychiatrist, because this is pure madness.'' Several defense and administration officials were asked Tuesday about <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s claim. The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because they did not want to become involved in the presidential race, said <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has about five dozen Frog-4 and Frog-7 battlefield missiles, dating from the 1960s. The Frog-7, when originally introduced by the Soviets, could carry either a conventional or nuclear warhead, `` but we're confident no nuclear warheads ever went to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> for that missile and it does n't have any range anyway,'' said one source who requested anonymity According to the reference book `` <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s Weapon Systems,'' the Frog-7 has a range of only about 43 miles _ or half the distance between <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Moreover, the rocket has no guidance system to direct it to a specific target. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said last month that <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has been under extensive surveillance since the 1962 missile crisis and there is `` no evidence'' any other nuclear weaponry had ever been deployed there by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. In the subcommittee transcript, <PERSON> Apud </PERSON> said he was told by <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> soldiers he had known for many years that the missiles were nicknamed `` <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Left,'' `` <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Right,'' and `` <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Central.''

Tens of thousands of miles of these riparian areas have been degraded by poor livestock grazing practices on land leased to ranchers by the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative wing of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffus </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> official, says the damaged land would start repairing itself if the bureau either would ban cattle from degraded streamsides or limit the amount of grazing there. But that solution is being made difficult because bureau leaders appear to be siding with opposition from many ranchers who pay below-market rates to graze cattle on the taxpayers' land, he told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> hearing Tuesday. Streamside areas are important in the arid West because they help raise water tables, collect sediment, increase the availability of forage, dissipate the energy of flood waters and serve as fish and wildlife habitats, said <PERSON> Duffus </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>'s associate director for resources, community and economic development `` It has taken decades of abuse to produce the level of riparian area degradation that currently exists,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> national parks and public lands subcommittee. `` Most riparian areas managed by the bureau are in degraded condition largely as a result of poorly managed livestock grazing.'' <PERSON> Duffus </PERSON> said that while the bureau does not know the extent of the damage, `` tens of thousands of stream miles on federal rangelands remain in degraded condition.'' <PERSON> Duffus </PERSON> said two bureau assessments found that 80 percent of the 12,000 miles of streamside areas in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> need better management and that 90 percent of 5,000 miles in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> were rated in poor or fair condition. Not only has the bureau reduced its ranks of wildlife and fisheries biologists since 1981, many remaining personnel responsible for riparian areas do n't believe the bureau is serious about improving the condition of the streamside areas, according to <PERSON> Duffus </PERSON>. `` These staff widely believe that if their proposed actions for restoring riparian areas are opposed by the permitted ranchers, their managers will not support them,'' he said. `` Many bureau staff ... recounted specific instances where their riparian management efforts were specifically undercut by bureau headquarters or local management direction after permitted ranches raised objections,'' <PERSON> Duffus </PERSON> said. Subcommittee Chairman <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Vento </PERSON>, D-Minn., distributed copies of a 1986 bureau headquarters memo telling field personnel that streamside area management `` requires the full support and cooperation of the permittee or lessee. Pointing to the memo, <PERSON> Vento </PERSON> asked whether ranchers using bureau land for cattle grazing are experts in environmental restoration. `` I would n't look to them for any expertise,'' <PERSON> Duffus </PERSON> replied. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Locke </PERSON>, a bureau spokesman, gave no immediate response when asked by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> to comment on <PERSON> Duffus </PERSON>' report.

<HEAD>Recording Industry Vows New Attack on DAT Recorders</HEAD>

 The music industry promises to find a new way to thwart home taping with digital recorders now that its proposed electronic anti-taping device has been declared ineffective by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standards </ORGANIZATION>. The bureau's report, released Tuesday, dealt a blow to the recording industry's campaign to prevent digital audio tape, or DAT, recorders from reaching the domestic market. The recorders, now manufactured by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and other foreign makers, can copy compact disc recordings with virtually no loss in sound quality. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> recording industry fears that the machines will lead to mass copying that would devastate the compact disc and record markets, and so far has managed to keep the devices off the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market. But Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kastenmeier </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>., chairman of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> that handles copyright issues, said the results of the bureau's study _ which he requested last year _ shows that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should stop trying to prevent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sales of DAT recorders <PERSON> Kastenmeier </PERSON> said the report appears to doom an industry-backed bill that would require equipping DAT recorders with scanning devices intended to prevent copying of specially coded recordings. The bill, sponsored by Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., also would prohibit the manufacture or sale of any device designed to bypass the scanner The bureau, an agency of the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said that the scanning device was unreliable and easily bypassed, and that it damaged the sound quality of recordings. `` Because the report was conclusive about the ineffectiveness of blocking devices, it is even more desirable that the DAT controversy be resolved by the industries involved, rather than by congressional imposition of a solution,'' <PERSON> Kastenmeier </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kastenmeier </PERSON> said in an interview that as a result of the bureau of standards report, `` I think it highly unlikely that the <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON> bill will succeed.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers voluntarily blocked introduction of DAT units on the domestic market until <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> resolved the home taping issue, but the self-imposed ban has recently shown signs of crumbling under pressure from foreign manufacturers and demand from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> recording enthusiasts. <PERSON> Kastenmeier </PERSON> said an alternative to a congressional solution might be payment of recording artists out of proceeds from sales of DAT units, or from an endowment fund created by the recording industry. <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Recording </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, said the industry accepts the study results but intends to find a new technological solution to home taping, which he said costs the recording companies $ 1.5 billion in lost sales annually. `` Working together with the hardware manufacturers, we are certain to find an acceptable technological solution,'' <PERSON> Berman </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, recording industry officials promised to sue any manufacturer that tries to sell the machines in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> before the copying issue is resolved, either legislatively or through industry negotiations. But <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recording </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> said `` there is no reason at this point why manufacturers should not be selling'' digital recorders in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The coalition has been fighting anti-taping efforts as an infringement on the rights of consumers to make home recordings of records, tapes and compact discs for their private use. The scanning device was designed to detect `` notches,'' or tiny bands of frequencies removed from the audio signal of protected recordings, and interrupt taping of copies with intervals of silence. The bureau said its series of laboratory tests showed that notched material was recorded anyway in about half of the sound tracks studied. Advocates of the anti-taping device claimed that the notches did not affect sound quality. But the bureau said its study showed that `` the system's encoder alters the original electrical signal,'' resulting in `` a discernible difference'' between notched and unnotched recordings. Also, the bureau said, `` the copy prevention system can be bypassed easily.'' It said its engineers designed and built several electronic circuits to circumvent the system in five different ways. `` The circuits are simple and easy to construct'' and cost about $ 100, the bureau said.

 Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>'s investment manager turned a $ 40,000 profit for him under an arrangement that may have involved financial favors or gifts to the attorney general, says a senator. The investment manager, <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON>, `` was n't investing Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s money, so much as he was assigning profits and losses to the accounts of Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and his other clients at his own discretion,'' Sen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, D-Mich., said Tuesday <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON>, now under indictment in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> scandal, turned a profit of nearly $ 40,000 for <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> on a $ 50,000 investment in just 23 one-day trades of brand-new stock issues over an 18-month span. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> established a limited blind partnership with <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON>'s company and the attorney general says that under the arrangement he knew nothing about <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON>'s stock trading activity. The Democratic majority staff of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on oversight of government management found that stock purchases by <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> which later appeared in <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s account were initially made without identifying the customer in whose name the stock would eventually be recorded. The purchases were assigned by <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> to the accounts he managed, after the profit or loss was known. The report said that in one instance, <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> bought and sold 5,000 shares of a new stock issue in <ORGANIZATION> Oliver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> worth $ 30,000 on Feb. 11, 1986. It was n't until the next day, however, that <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> instructed <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> that 2,000 of the shares were to be recorded for <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s account. The transaction gave <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> a profit of more than $ 1,700. In seven of the 23 stock trades, <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> spent substantially more money on behalf of his corporation's limited blind partnership with <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> than <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> had invested in the account, the subcommittee staff found. The sums ranged from $ 5,000 to $ 140,000. <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> exceeded the account balances for his other customers as well, said the subcommittee staff. He avoided the appearance that he had exceeded the account balance by directing that his stock purchases be recorded as if they had been made in smaller lots, any one of which would not exceed the account balance. `` Because he did not allocate winners and losers to his clients' accounts until after the fact, he was effectively able to assign greater benefits to some _ including apparently Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> on numerous occasions,'' <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> said in a statement `` This procedure again raises questions about possible financial favors or gifts.'' <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> asked the Office of Government Ethics in a letter for a formal finding on whether <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> complied with federal regulations governing gifts and loans to public officials. <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> also sent a copy of the letter to the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to investigate possible violations of regulations prohibiting brokers from exceeding account balances and regulations governing the conduct by investment advisers. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> `` had no knowledge of <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON>'s stock trading activity and I do n't think <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> should be held responsible,'' said one of the attorney general's lawyers, <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON>. `` This blind partnership was set up to be sure that he had no knowledge of how things were being done.'' <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> dismissed suggestions that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> should have reported the amount over the account balances as gifts, saying `` there were a number of losing transactions as well as profitable transactions.'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> made a profit on 18 of the trades and lost money on five. According to the majority subcommittee staff, on Sept. 4, 1986, <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> had $ 730,000 in five of his customers' accounts at <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, but on that day bought $ 6.6 million in <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> stock for them, which subsequently was reflected as 34 separate transactions and sales. <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON>, a former director of scandal-plagued <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, was introduced to the attorney general in 1985 by longtime <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> friend <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>. <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> are now under indictment for racketeering, fraud and conspiracy in an alleged scheme to extract payments from the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, defense contractor in order to influence <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and other federal officials. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> have pleaded innocent. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has been under criminal investigation by independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> since last May 11 for his involvement with <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> acknowledges interceding on behalf of the company when he was <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> counselor to ensure that the firm got a fair hearing from the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in its effort to win a $ 32 million no-bid engine-building contract. The company eventually got the work. Sources familiar with <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s probe say one aspect of the investigation has been an examination of <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON>'s stock trading to determine whether <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> may have given <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> preferential treatment over other customers. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> may be found to have benefited from a `` very subtle bribe'' if preferential treatment were found and were determined to be a reward for official action, one knowledgeable law enforcement source said in December. One of <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON>'s lawyers, <PERSON> Penny </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, said the questions addressed by <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>'s subcommittee are `` exactly the same material the independent counsel went over for months and they found no wrongdoing. There was no wrongdoing.'' She said that <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> `` did no better for <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> than any other client.'' The subcommittee staff did n't reach any conclusions on whether <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> received preferential treatment.

<HEAD>Report: Improper Use of Seat Belts Dangerous but Common</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Many motorists who wear seat belts are still exposing themselves to serious injury by wearing them improperly, according to a federal study that says women, children and motorists over 50 are most likely to put themselves at risk. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> raised questions Tuesday about the way some belt users wear the safety devices after examining 167 accidents in which at least one occupant was belted. Twenty-one percent of the motorists wearing belts had too much slack in the shoulder harnesses, and 7 percent of the occupants, often children, wore belts that were improperly routed behind the back or under an arm. Thirty-one states have laws requiring use of safety belts. But <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> said, `` We have a lot of misuse and that problem has to be tackled.'' Overall, the safety board said, lap-shoulder belts provide excellent protection with 80 percent of the belted occupants suffering minor or no injuries. But the study suggested the results could have been even better were it not for improper wearing of belts. The <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> study was not a random sample and, therefore, does not necessarily translate into similar percentages for all motorists, said <PERSON> Lynne </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who was involved in writing of the report. But, she added, the data are consistent with previous findings of widespread misuse. For example, the report cited an earlier insurance industry study of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> motorists indicating that belts are worn too loosely about one-fourth of the time. Examples of misuse with tragic consequences included a head-on collision and an accident in which a car struck a tree, according to the safety board. In the head-on crash, a passenger who had loosened her shoulder belt significantly died of massive injuries, while the driver who had worn his belt snugly `` walked away from the crash with moderate injuries,'' said <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Stack </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> staff researcher. In the other crash, the driver, who had worn his belt properly, escaped with minor injuries when his car struck a tree, but the passenger, whose shoulder belt was routed under her arm, was killed from extensive injuries. The board also cited examples of people suffering extensive injuries _ fatal ones in a case involving a 7-year-old boy _ when belts were used while seats were in the reclining position. In some cases the combination of the belt and the reclining seat may create new dangers, the report suggested. The four-member safety board urged the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to require that safety belts meet standards for the maximum amount of slack allowed or require that the belt systems be equipped with a `` pre-tension'' device that automatically pulls a belt tight a split second before a crash. The safety board questioned the widespread use among <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carmakers of a belt design that allows a person to pull the belt out to its full length without it automatically retracting. Most foreign manufacturers use another design which automatically keeps the belt snug against the occupant, but which has been criticized as being less comfortable and, therefore, less likely to be used. The safety board said there is evidence indicating drivers aged 50 years or older and female occupants are the most likely to misuse belts, especially wearing them too loosely. Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said that, generally, slack equal to no more than the width of a fist should be allowed in the shoulder belt. A particularly high misuse of belts was found among children. One-third had part of the belts behind the back or under an arm. `` Such misuse ... seriously degrades the protective capabilities of the lap-shoulder belt, reducing it to a lap-only belt with inferior crash protection,'' the safety board said. A number of auto safety pamphlets, including two distributed by the <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> and one by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, have advised parents to place the shoulder belt behind a child if the harness crosses the neck or face. `` The safety board does not agree,'' the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> report said. `` There is little evidence that small children or short adults are likely to be harmed by the shoulder portion of a belt.'' The board called for the highway safety agency to revise its brochures. <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION>, which issues auto safety regulations, was reviewing the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> report, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> might not have fared that well in the Winter Olympics, but <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> was a big winner. The high-rated two weeks of prime-time Olympics, pre-empting <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s entire schedule, have given the network a February sweeps win that breaks <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s 11-sweeps streak. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> is now second on the season. The Olympics averaged a prime-time rating of 19.3 and a 30 share, up 5 percent over the 1984 Winter Olympics, according to the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> estimates that more than 150 million viewers saw some of this year's Games Saturday night's figure-skating finale was last week's No. 1 show, earning a rating of 26.4 and a 43 share, and included the highest-rated half hour of Saturday viewing since `` Roots'' in 1977. Olympics coverage on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday also made it into the top 10. Wednesday's was 12th, Sunday's 17th, and Friday's 30th <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> had no other prime-time programming. The Olympics also apparently helped <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> continue its three-week win streak over <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> in news. For the week that ended Feb. 26, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` World News Tonight'' had an average rating of 11.7 and a 21 share `` CBS Evening News'' had an 11.2 and 20 and `` NBC Nightly News'' had 9.9 and 18. The rating is the percentage of the nation's 88.6 million households with televisions. The share is a percentage of sets in use. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> won the week that ended Feb. 28 with an average rating of 20.5. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> was second with 15.6 and CBS third with 13.5. It was the highest weekly rating for any network since October 1986, and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s highest since October 1985 February is one of four months a year when local ratings are measured for use in negotiating advertising rates. With only days left uncounted in the February sweeps, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> led <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> by about 1.5 rating points. CBS is third. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> has an average 16.3 after 23 weeks of the television season. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> is second with 14.1, and CBS third with 13.6. The top 10 prime-time shows last week were: Saturday Olympics, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>; `` The Cosby Show,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>; Tuesday Olympics, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>; `` A Different World,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>; Monday Olympics, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>; `` 60 Minutes,'' CBS; `` Cheers,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>; Thursday Olympics, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>; `` Murder, She Wrote,'' CBS; and `` Matlock,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. The four-part miniseries `` Noble House'' ended disappointingly for <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. The final installment Wednesday night took a slight upturn, but was only 20th. The first part of CBS' two-part `` Bluegrass'' did better, coming in 15th with a 17.6 rating and 27 share. The annual rerun of the classic movie `` The Wizard of Oz'' on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> last Wednesday had its lowest rating yet, but still placed 25th with a 15.3 and 22. The lowest-rated shows of the week _ the rankings were abbreviated due to the Olympics taking up <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s schedule, were: `` Wiseguy,'' `` <ORGANIZATION> Cagney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Lacey </PERSON>,'' `` <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Spoon </PERSON>,'' `` <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>,'' `` Our House,'' `` <PERSON> Garfield </PERSON>,'' `` Equalizer,'' `` High Mountain Rangers'' and `` West 57th,'' which was against the Olympics Saturday night and got a dismal 5.5 rating and 9 share.

<HEAD>Immigration Changes to Affect Farmers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> labor expert says farmers probably will begin feeling the impact of a new federal immigration law next year. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Coltrane </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 exempts many agricultural employers from penalties for knowingly hiring illegal aliens, but that exemption will expire Dec. 1. `` The real test is likely to come after that time, when penalties can be imposed and immigration investigators may take a more aggressive approach to agriculture,'' <PERSON> Coltrane </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Coltrane </PERSON>, whose analysis is scheduled for the March issue of Farmline magazine, said farm employers may be relying heavily on the Special Agricultural Worker program, or SAW, which allows temporary legal resident status for foreign workers who formerly helped in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production of designated perishable crops. Producers of those crops are exempted from the law's penalties until Dec. 1. As defined by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> regulations, those crops include not only fruits and vegetables, but also wheat, sugarbeets and a number of other commodities. <PERSON> Coltrane </PERSON> said the main crops not qualifying as SAW commodities are cotton, sugarcane, hay, sod, forage and silage, seed intended solely for seed use, flax, millet and sorghum. Livestock producers also are not covered by the SAW provision. The pool of SAW workers has been growing, although it is still relatively small compared with total agricultural labor needs, <PERSON> Coltrane </PERSON> said. In the first eight months of signup, June 1987 through January, around 240,000 workers filed SAW applications, the first step to temporary legal residency and, under certain conditions, eventual <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizenship. But only about 2 percent of the SAW applications through December were filed from outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Coltrane </PERSON> said this means that temporary rules relaxing border restrictions to bring in farm workers have not had much of an impact. Moreover, there is no requirement that SAW workers stay with farm jobs. `` Once farm workers receive their work authorization card, they can work wherever they want, and in whatever industry they want,'' he said. `` Agricultural employers have no assurance that the workers will stay in agriculture.''

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has used up virtually all of its authorization to buy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat at subsidized prices with additional purchases totaling 500,000 metric tons for delivery this year. <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials said Tuesday that the latest sales, equal to about 18.3 million bushels, were handled by <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, 100,000 tons; <ORGANIZATION> Cargill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, 375,000 tons; and <ORGANIZATION> Mitsui </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, 25,000 tons. At recent prices averaging $ 2.75 per bushel, the wheat would have a farm value of about $ 50 million. More than 6.8 million tons of subsidized wheat has been sold to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> under the department's Export Enhancement Program, or EEP, for delivery in the year that began last Oct. 1. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pope </PERSON>, acting general sales manager for the department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said that only 200 tons of wheat are still available to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> under current <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> authorization. There has been no official indication that a new line of subsidy may be approved. Under <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION>, private exporters are given surplus commodities owned by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> so they can sell a foreign buyer wheat or other authorized commodity at competitive world prices. <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> said the subsidies, or bonuses, averaged $ 27 per ton on the latest sales, or about 74 cents per bushel. The subsidies for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have been available only for wheat. The sales also are part of the grain the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is committed to buy during the fifth and final year of a long-term agreement, which calls for the annual purchase of at least 9 million tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain. The pact expires Sept. 30. According to the agreement, the annual purchases include a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and corn. The Soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million tons as wheat, corn or soybeans, with every ton of beans counting as two tons of grain _ up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain equivalent. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans, or 39. bushels of corn In addition, 2.62 million tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn, 813,300 tons of soybeans and 1.3 million tons of soybean meal have been bought by the Soviets for delivery this year.

<HEAD>The Iditarod Mushes Through Red Ink</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL JENKINS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When the first musher charges north in the 16th annual Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race on Saturday, organizers already will have their own victory, over <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s economic bust and the race's $ 773,000 debt Fifty-five mushers have signed up for the rugged 1,100-mile contest billed as `` the Last Great Race on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>.'' Last year, 63 teams signed up; the year before, 73. This year's field includes four-time champion <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Swenson </PERSON>; two-time winner <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Butcher </PERSON>, whose $ 50,000 winner's check last year bounced; 1983 champion <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Mackey </PERSON>; and 16 rookies. Mushers from <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> also have signed up. The race is named after the Iditarod Trail, an old gold rush and mail route to <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION>. This year's race takes mushers over the tougher northern route, where temperatures, although moderate of late, can reach minus 50 degrees. Starting in downtown <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> on trucked-in snow, racers must cross over the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Range </LOCATION>, traverse frozen tundra and climb the timbered <LOCATION> Kuskokwim </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> to reach the <LOCATION> Yukon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Ruby </LOCATION>, an old gold mining community. The mushers trek south on the Yukon and turn toward the coast at <LOCATION> Kaltag </LOCATION>. At <LOCATION> Unalakleet </LOCATION>, the teams turn north and run along the windblown coast and sea ice to <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION>'s Front Street. The trail became part of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s legends in 1925, when 20 mushers pushed for 127 -LCB- hours to relay diphtheria serum 674 miles from <LOCATION> Nenana </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION> to save the city from an epidemic. After the check issued Butcher bounced, a special audit in April found the race was $ 773,000 in debt, said <PERSON> Rosemary </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, the race's executive director. `` I suppose the economy had a lot to do with it,'' she said. `` The Iditarod was caught up in the collapse. More was spent than was taken in.'' Oil prices peaked at about $ 30 a barrel in 1985 but plunged to less than $ 10 by July 1986. About 85 percent of the state's revenues come from royalties and taxes paid by the oil industry When oil prices fell, the state's economy, heavily dependent on state expenditures, went into the abyss. Bankruptcies and foreclosures soared. Property values tumbled, jobs dried up and businesses closed, but the Iditarod, which relies on private contributions, did not get the message. `` We had a hard time seeing our problem,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Iditarod </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lavon </PERSON> <PERSON> Barve </PERSON>. `` There was a budget, and the money was spent for that budget, but the money did n't come in.'' <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Redington </PERSON>, an Iditarod board member and race founder, said the race was spending money for things it did not need. `` We spent a lot of money and did n't pay no bills,'' he said. `` It was spent unwisely. We had too many employees. We had top salaries and all the benefits. We had better insurance than <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>.'' When the race's financial problems became known, officials cut the staff by two-thirds. `` We had 34 to start with. The rest took pay cuts. We cut all benefits,'' <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Potts </PERSON>, race coordinator since 1983, said about 700 volunteers, such as pilots and ham radio operators, worked for the race last year. She expected about 1,200 this year. While cutting expenses, the race also has found new sponsors. A footwear manufacturer's four-year sponsorship could bring in more than $ 500,000, <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said. A dog food manufacturer agreed to a one-year contract worth more than $ 25,000. A television network has offered $ 15,000 for coverage rights. Merchandising the Iditarod name on everything from beer steins to buttons makes up as much as 40 percent of the race's revenues, she said. `` As of right now, our outstanding debts are about $ 220,000. I think it's fantastic,'' <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said. This year's purse will be at least $ 125,000, still the largest purse in sled dog racing, she said. <PERSON> Potts </PERSON> said she never doubted the race would continue. `` There were people last June who did n't think we were going to have a race this year,'' she said. `` We fooled them. We're going to have one. It's just bigger than all the little problems we had last year.''

<BYLINE>Critics Charge US-Canada Pact Leaves Auto Problems Unsolved</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 A treaty to eliminate most tariff barriers between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> leaves disputes in the auto industry unresolved, witnesses at a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> hearing said. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadrich </PERSON>, director of governmental affairs and international trade with the <ORGANIZATION> Automotive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accessories </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday the treaty was `` a lopsided agreement that sanctions long-standing Canadian protectionism.'' He told the trade subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that the treaty would put <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> parts makers at the mercy of foreign competitors. Automotive products, which account for about one-third of the trade between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, have been governed for more than 20 years by the Auto Pact, which gives duty-free treatment to some parts and vehicles moving between the two countries. Critics of the free-trade agreement, however, charge that Canadian efforts to attract manufacturing have given their makers an unfair advantage under the Auto Pact, and the agreement leaves that advantage in place. `` Our current bilateral auto trade is skewed, to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s benefit, by a number of trade-distorting practices,'' resulting in part from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s domestic-content requirements and duty rebates on some auto parts, said Rep. <PERSON> Sander </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Southfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, Democrat <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckman </PERSON>, international economist for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union, said that the treaty, by retaining Canadian production incentives for <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION>, provides `` a subsidy of Canadian production, much of which will be sold in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>'' An exception to that overall assessment was given by <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vehicle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents auto manufacturers. <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> said the treaty would create the world's largest free-trade zone and `` takes on and resolves most of the trouble spots which were developing in the bilateral auto trade.'' He said concerns that the treaty would provide expanded entry for Japanese and Korean manufacturers were unfounded because the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> auto industry already has excess manufacturing capacity. `` It makes no sense for the <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> government to lure more foreign auto investment, especially when much of the production would be headed for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market,'' he said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> says it was unable to determine what caused the crash in 1986 of a helicopter scheduled to carry the entourage of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> in which four people died. Investigators concluded that poor flying conditions, including fog that caused limited visibility, were factors in the June 6, 1986, crash in <LOCATION> Sutton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. But the official probable cause was listed as `` undetermined.'' <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, the lead investigator, said Tuesday the massive disintegration of the helicopter hindered the inquiry. `` We're only as good as the evidence,'' he said. `` There's no evidence to point to anything that we can concretely say'' triggered the crash, <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> said. Investigators originally concentrated on a mysterious piece of wire that raised questions of sabotage, but that turned out to be part of an electrical testing instrument. The investigation later focused on what looked like a frayed cable that controlled the tail rotor, which provides stability to the craft. But the final report, issued Monday, said `` no pre-impact part failure -LRB- or -RRB- malfunction was found.'' Four employees of <ORGANIZATION> Sikorsky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> were killed when the seven-seat, Sikorsky-built S-76B helicopter went down on a trip from <LOCATION> Hanscom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, back to Sikorsky headquarters in <LOCATION> Stratford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn </LOCATION>. The helicopter was one of four Sikorsky had provided to <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> during his New <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> visit, but the king, his family and aides drove from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> Westover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Middlebury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, for the graduation of his daughter, Princess <PERSON> Zeim </PERSON>, because of the bad weather. Her twin sister, Princess <PERSON> Aisha </PERSON>, graduated from the <ORGANIZATION> Dana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wellesley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, later that weekend. Sikorsky spokesman <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said the company supports the board's findings. <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> said the crash illustrates the need for smaller aircraft to carry `` black boxes,'' devices that would tape the crew's conversations and possibly provide clues The safety board has been pushing the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to require cockpit voice recorders in smaller craft, including helicopters that seat at least six passengers. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> is considering the proposed rules change.

<HEAD>Scientists Confirm Superconductivity Temperature Record</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Scientists in two laboratories say they have confirmed a report from researchers that a new kind of superconducting material loses all resistance to electricity at a record high temperature. Researchers at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> say the material showed zero resistance at about minus 269 degrees Fahrenheit, more than 20 degrees above previous widely accepted reports for stable superconducting compounds. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Chu </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> said he had confirmed the <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> results, finding zero resistance at minus 272 degrees. He said his sample also expelled an applied magnetic field, a hallmark of superconductivity called the Meissner effect. The results also have been confirmed by researchers at <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> Present. He said he could not release details. Superconductivity is the ability to carry current without resistance. Scientists are trying to make materials that become superconducting at as high a temperature as possible, to make them practical for uses in high-speed computers, bullet trains and other applications. Higher temperatures than the <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> mark have been reported in the press. But some have not been confirmed in other laboratories, and others refer to the temperature at which a sample shows initial signs of isolated pockets of superconductivity, rather than superconducting pathways along its entire length. The new compound showed initial signs of superconductivity at minus 238 degrees, said <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> researcher <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hermann </PERSON>, who did the research with <PERSON> Zhenghi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheng </PERSON>. That is slightly higher than the mark of about minus 243 degrees recently reported for superconductors that include the element bismuth rather than a so-called `` rare earth.'' The <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> compound uses the element thallium rather than bismuth or rare earth. Other ingredients are calcium, barium, copper and oxygen. The results were announced to the press and at a scientific meeting last month, but were not widely reported. They have been accepted for publication in the British journal <ORGANIZATION> Nature </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Hermann </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. <PERSON> Chu </PERSON> said lessons from the thallium and bismuth compounds will help in developing materials with still higher temperatures. He also noted that the thallium compound showed zero resistance above 100 degrees on the <PERSON> Kelvin </PERSON> scale, giving a psychological boost for hopes of higher temperatures. The 100-degree <PERSON> Kelvin </PERSON> mark corresponds to about minus 280 degrees Fahrenheit. Thallium is `` not quite practical'' for applications outside the laboratory because it is toxic and in limited supply, he said. <PERSON> Hermann </PERSON> said he thinks thallium and bismuth eventually will be abandoned in favor of new materials with higher temperatures and better characteristics for applications. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>, physics professor at <ORGANIZATION> Brooklyn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, said the <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> work is encouraging because it shows that substituting elements in superconducting materials may lead to higher temperatures.

 A federal court ruling expected today in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> could determine whether new regulations will go into effect this week that cut off funds to family planning centers which advocate or perform abortions. The months of debate continued Tuesday as <PERSON> Nabers </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabaniss </PERSON>, deputy assistant secretary at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, defended the administration proposals before members of a family planning group challenging the regulations in court. <PERSON> Cabaniss </PERSON> told the gathering that the new Title X regulations were not an attack on the family planning industry but a reaffirmation of the administration's anti-abortion policy. Addressing the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reproductive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Cabaniss </PERSON> said the new regulations, due to go into effect tomorrow, would withhold funding to centers in which `` abortion is a method of family planning.'' `` We support family planning but not abortion on demand,'' she said, urging the group to `` work together to separate family planning from abortion.'' <PERSON> Cabaniss </PERSON> said the regulations require so-called `` non-directive'' counseling, which offers pregnant women information about their medical options with the exception of abortion. If the facility also performs abortions, to keep Title X funding for its other programs the clinic must maintain separate personnel, separate accounting procedures, and provide different and clearly defined waiting and treatment rooms for each type of patient. Among participants speaking out against the new Title X rules was <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. She told <PERSON> Cabaniss </PERSON>: `` We are not fools. Women wo n't come to programs that ca n't help them. `` These regulations will destroy the family planning programs and in doing so the lives of millions of poor women.'' Since the regulations were published in the Federal Register last month, two injunctions have been granted in courts in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> suit was brought by <ORGANIZATION> Planned </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parenthood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, while the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> court action was brought by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> ruling covers all Planned Parenthood centers, and the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> ruling covers clinics in that state. A third suit, filed by <ORGANIZATION> NFPRHA </ORGANIZATION> in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, seeks an injunction to protect its publicly funded member clinics and other family planning centers not covered by the other injunctions. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Swirling </PERSON>, the association's executive director, said the suit was filed to eliminate regulations he asserted `` are illegal, violate the intent of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, violate medical ethics and could harm the health care of almost 5 million poor women we serve.'' If the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> court agrees, the three preliminary injunctions would stop the regulations from going into effect and give the court time to look at the regulations and issue or deny a permanent injunction, <PERSON> Cabaniss </PERSON> said. `` In this case we would expect some permanent ruling in March,'' she said, adding that the cases will end up in the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. If the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> denies the injunction, <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> must decide whether to wait or implement the regulations affecting those clinics not covered in the Planned Parenthood or <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> suits. As head of the Office of Population Affairs, <PERSON> Cabaniss </PERSON> administers the $ 140 million Title X program, which funds about 4,000 family planning centers. According to <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> statistics, 85 percent of the patients served by these centers are low-income and one-third of them are adolescents.

 Work could begin this week on a $ 2.3 million elevator that will allow visitors to view what is believed to be the perch from which President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was shot. The contract to build the elevator was awarded Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> struggled to fund the exhibit for the past 11 years, and plans to raise $ 1.5 million more from private sources for additional renovations on the sixth floor of the former <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schoolbook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depository </ORGANIZATION>. `` As sad as it is, it is the most important historical site in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Lindalyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, president of foundation. The project includes construction of a six-story access tower that will house the elevator and a one-story, ground-level exhibit hall adjacent to the building. The exhibit, to be called `` The Sixth Floor,'' is expected to attract an estimated 300,000 to 500,000 visitors annually. The <ORGANIZATION> Warren </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> determined that on Nov. 22, 1963, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> fired a high-powered rifle at <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION>'s motorcade from the sixth floor of what is now the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Administration Building, where he worked. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Callaway </PERSON>, a partner in the architectural firm of <LOCATION> Hendrick </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Callaway </LOCATION>, said construction could be completed by November. But foundation officials say they are unlikely to schedule the exhibit's opening for Nov. 22, the 25th anniversary of <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s assassination `` We think it would be inappropriate,'' Ms. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said.

 About 30 of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s leading entertainers staged a sing-in to protest the government's handling of 12 weeks of Arab riots in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. `` Shalom, shalom, we are making peace. There will be peace. We are together beyond fear,'' they sang, swaying together on a stage in front of <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>'s City Hall. About 3,000 Israelis sang along in Hebrew to the tune of `` We are the World.'' The protesters also heard newly released peace songs and carried placards that said `` We wo n't be a nation of bullies'' and `` Enough of occupation.'' The demonstration was held in Kings of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plaza </LOCATION>, site of a protest by more than 100,000 Israelis in 1982 that helped lead to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s pullout from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Tuesday's protest was sponsored by <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Line </LOCATION>, peace activists who are staging a four-day march from <LOCATION> Rosh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haniqra </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> border to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, where about 1,500 marchers are expected today. Three months of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> rioting against the 20-year Israeli occupation of their homelands has produced a crop of new protest songs, the first since the end of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s three-year occupation of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1985. Among the stars was <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Fayrouz </PERSON>, the Iranian-born singer who recently released `` A Song For Children.'' The lyrics say, `` he was born of mother war, but deep in his heart, he just wanted to be a poet.'' A number of participants expressed disappointment at the relatively small turnout. But <PERSON> Rami </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleinstein </PERSON>, a rock musician and Ms. <PERSON> Fayrouz </PERSON>'s husband, predicted `` change is going to happen.'' One of the most critical songs was by <PERSON> Si </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyman </PERSON>, 26, who wrote `` Shooting and Crying'' to protest an incident last month in which <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers buried alive four Arabs in <LOCATION> Kfar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION>. The victims were rescued by relatives. Ms. <PERSON> Hyman </PERSON> sang: `` Shooting and crying, burning and laughing `` When did we learn to bury alive? `` Shooting and crying, burning and laughing `` When did we forget that we also had children killed?'' In an interview after the performance, she said she was shocked that `` this was done by the Jewish people who lived through the Holocaust. I said to myself we've got to stop it.''

 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> were rebuilt with <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s help after World War II and should now repay the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by picking up a larger share of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and Japanese defense costs, according to a well-known historian. The comments Tuesday by <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> historian <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> echoed other calls by legislators and former government officials as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> for a two-day meeting of the 16-nation <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, author of `` The Rise and Fall of Great Nations,'' told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that calls for increased `` burden sharing'' are part of the effort to find a way out of ever-growing defense expenditures. Some American allies `` are now richer per capita than the <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said, adding that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> `` ought to bear a larger share of the defense burden.'' Sen. <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., chairman of the panel, agreed, saying: `` It seems to me we are draining our power trying to do too much Our adversaries are happy to see us try. Our allies have n't done as much as they can to help. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> also agreed at least in part with <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. At a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> hearing earlier Tuesday, he said, `` I quite agree with the thesis that our allies need to do more.'' But he added that `` I do n't think it is very useful to simply berate the Europeans on this.'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel that he does n't think <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> will increase spending in response to complaints by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, D-Pa., chairman of the committee, complained about what he called `` unequal sharing'' by <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> countries `` Our allies in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> are not doing, in my estimation, enough for their own defense,'' he said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is spending about 6 percent of its gross national product on defense while no other countries in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> are above 3 percent, <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said. Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Durbin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., said the average Japanese citizen spends about $ 100 a year in taxes for defense, while the average American spends $ 1,200 `` We need to make every effort to get our allies to do more,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> agreed, but he added that they do more than is `` generally recognized.'' He cited a statistic that <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> would supply 90 percent of the ground troops that would be used to halt a Soviet non-nuclear attack. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s defense budget is 5.7 percent of the nation's GNP, not 6 percent and he added that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense budgets generally have stayed even or declined in recent years. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> has long set a target for each member to increase spending by 3 percent a year after inflation, and most nations do n't meet that target, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has n't met the 3 percent target for at least four years, he added. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> and Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> needs to improve its conventional defenses in the wake of the treaty banning medium-range atomic missiles from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> detailed <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s shortcomings in non-nuclear weapons, but added, `` surely the prospect of having to fight 16 nations at once remains a sobering one for the Kremlin.''

 When <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> convened last July for the first time in 15 years, it vowed to build democracy from the ruins of authoritarian rule. Seven months later, critics say it has been slow to address fundamental issues. The new constitution, drafted under President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, reestablished the bicameral, U.S.-style <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Former President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> abolished <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1972 and replaced it with a single-chamber, rubber-stamp assembly. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> were elected in May 1987, and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> convened last July 27. Since then, more than 6,000 bills have been submitted in the 23-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and the 202-member House. As of the end of February, only 13 had been enacted into law. `` The bills are not an indication of quality at all,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Bonifacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillego </PERSON>. He said most were for local projects such as roads, schools and hospitals. Meanwhile, legislation on major national issues, such as land reform, has been bogged down by special interests and organizational problems in the two chambers. Commentators and congressional sources disagree on why <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has not been more productive. Some complain that traditional politicians spend too much time on `` peripheral'' topics or delivering lengthy speeches while ignoring complex issues. `` It's part of the turmoil of transition, part of growing up,'' said opposition leader <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamboa </PERSON>, who was defeated for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> last May. `` Vital issues of legislation that should have far-reaching effects on the condition of the people have not been addressed.'' Some congressmen defend the slow pace, saying it is better to take time with complicated issues than rush legislation which members may later regret. `` We can not afford to hurry that much and regret it later,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON>. `` We're not just talking about our few interests but a complex situation.'' Sen. <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Maceda </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, also defended the slow pace. `` Is that what they want, faster laws but probably imperfect laws?'' <PERSON> Maceda </PERSON> said in an interview. `` We're slower, but probably all sides are heard.'' Last month, eight Senators formed a `` conscience bloc'' and publicly criticized <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Jovito </PERSON> <PERSON> Salonga </PERSON> for delays in bringing legislation to the floor. One of the eight, Sen. <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Romulo </PERSON>, said economic and social issues `` have not been given the importance they deserve.'' He added, `` Our performance will be assessed by how much we have done to improve the quality of life of our people.'' <PERSON> Salonga </PERSON> promised to speed up <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> proceedings and reduce the time allotted for speeches. Some congressmen also complain that the two chambers lack sufficient staff and resources to provide members with detailed information and advice on legislation. Many commentators view the current debate on land reform as a test case of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' ability to legislate controversial issues with far-reaching impact on national life. Last July, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> decreed a nationwide land redistribution program but left virtually all the difficult decisions, such as compensation and retention limits, to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. She gave the lawmakers 90 days to approve the legislation, and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitra </PERSON> boasted his chamber would meet the deadline within 30 days. But neither the House nor the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has approved a land reform bill, in part because of opposition by landlord members. `` There has been considerable delay, almost intentional on the part of the landlords to avoid the passage of an agrarian reform bill,'' said <PERSON> Gillego </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Judge Says Drug Rulings Should Be Appealed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> should appeal a pair of conflicting rulings on random drug testing for civilian government employees in order to resolve the issue, says a judge responsible for one of the decisions. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> on Tuesday ordered the Army to stop random checks of 9,400 of its civilian employees for drug use because the tests are an unreasonable search prohibited by the Constitution. `` It is with some regret that the court removes what might be a powerful weapon from the nation's arsenal in the campaign against illegal drug use, but the values represented by the Constitution and Fourth Amendment are transcendent,'' <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> ruled. <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> said random checks could not be justified by safety concerns because the urine test used by the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> did not indicate whether an employee was using drugs on the job. The ruling was made on three challenges brought by public employees unions to the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s 1986 order directing random drug tests of civilians in sensitive jobs. The cases involved unions representing civilians at Ft.. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Sharp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depot </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lathrop </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> and guards at <ORGANIZATION> Aberdeen </ORGANIZATION> Proving Ground, Md Noting that another federal judge in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last year upheld random drug testing of nearly 30,000 <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> employees, <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> invited the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to appeal his decision. He also suggested that the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> here consolidate the two cases for a single review of `` a question of exceptional importance.'' Based on <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON>'s invitation, `` we are reviewing the opinion and are considering an appeal,'' said <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. On Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> agreed to review a ruling by a federal appeals court in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, which had upheld drug testing of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> employees who seek promotions. A federal appeals court in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> last month ruled unconstitutional the mandatory drug testing of railway workers involved in accidents.

 Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> says increases in the government's food stamp program are needed to make up for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration cuts that have helped create hunger in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> through the 1980s. `` The cold statistics only begin to measure the toll in terms of the human lives damaged, disabled and destroyed by our shameful abdication of responsibility in recent years,'' the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Democrat told a group of nutrition activists Tuesday. `` We have financed the greatest arms buildup in human history, but once again we are losing the war on hunger,'' he said. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, planned to introduce legislation today with Sen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., and Rep. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, D-Calif., that would help `` right those wrongs `` I do not intend to accept proposals that seek to balance the federal budget on the backs of poor children,'' he said. `` Survival of the fittest may be the law of the jungle, but it is not the law of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and it is time for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to help.'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said his anti-hunger legislation would raise food stamp benefits `` so that no Americans are forced to go hungry for the last part of every month.'' It also would ease food stamp eligibility requirements and provide more public information about the program. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said hunger in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> was largely eradicated by the late 1970s, but `` misguided'' budget cuts under President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> have `` rubbed salt in the wounds'' created by the recession of the early 1980s, triggering the re-emergence of hunger. Earlier, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>'s annual conference that the nation needs a `` compassionate urban agenda.'' <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayors </ORGANIZATION>' task force on hunger and homelessness, said both problems are growing, especially among families with children. `` The sad truth is that hunger is now more prevalent in our nation than at any time since the Great Depression,'' he said.

 The underdog hero of the Winter Olympics, British ski-jumper <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> `` The Eagle'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, has been offered a recording contract and may soon appear in commercials endorsing a brand of vodka. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, who became the Olympics' favorite loser, flew home to a hero's welcome Tuesday. He was the last man off the plane. A plasterer from <LOCATION> Cheltenham </LOCATION>, in southwest <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> won the hearts of this nation of underdog-lovers by finishing last in ski-jumping events in <LOCATION> Calgary </LOCATION>. He arrived at <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> with the 100-member British team, some of whom wore `` Eddie The Eagle'' T-shirts. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, 24, trooped into the airport to be greeted by flower-throwing fans and an army of photographers, reporters and television crews. `` I've made it, I've made it to the Olympics,'' The Eagle said. `` That's all I cared about.'' <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> and <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Heath </PERSON>, a retired couple from <LOCATION> Wimbledon </LOCATION>, were among the well-wishers. `` We saw him on TV,'' said <PERSON> Heath </PERSON>. `` He was just wonderful.'' `` He's got guts,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, a transport executive. `` He's captured the imagination of people. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> was <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s first ski-jumper in the Games for more than 50 years. He finished last in both the 70-meter and 90-meter events, but endeared himself to millions of armchair athletes with his gangly, bemused clumsiness, enhanced by the thick glasses that gave him a bird-like look. His hometown is planning a parade for him on Thursday. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said he was suprised by all the publicity he received, but said: `` I'm going to try not to let it get in the way. Nothing's going to change. I'm still a jumper. I'm still training.'' When he was asked if fame might go to his head, <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> replied: `` I'll try not to let it.'' He confirmed, however, he intends to cut a record titled `` Fly, <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON>, Fly.'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> signed up an agent, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> music promoter <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Platz </PERSON>, who told a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION> interviewer <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagle </ORGANIZATION> would cut the record today. `` He says he can sing, and that's good enough for me,'' said <PERSON> Platz </PERSON>. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> also was negotiating a deal to endorse <PERSON> Vladivar </PERSON>, a brand of vodka. `` It's great to actually have somebody who's prepared to have a smile at themselves _ and keep on coming last. That's very important,'' <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Staniforth </PERSON>, the vodka company representative, told the interviewer. Critics had said <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> should not have entered the Olympic events because of the danger, but he said, `` I proved them wrong.'' `` I've only been jumping two years, and the trainers I've talked to say there's no reason I ca n't get into the top five. Hopefully, I'll be a force to reckon with next year.'' But in the meantime, <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said he wanted to get back to his job as plasterer. `` It's a nice rest, plastering,'' he said.

 A stamp cancellation such as the British one proclaiming that `` Jesus Is Alive'' could not be issued in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> official says. The Postal Service's 74 division managers can approve special cancellations for events of general public interest, said <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Rustin </PERSON>, manager of the Stamp Information Branch. The special cancellations may not deal with things only of local interest or for political, religious, fraternal, trade or commercial purposes, he said Tuesday. The British Post Office on Tuesday began postmarking nearly all letters mailed in that country with the words `` Jesus Is Alive!'' as part of a private arrangement financed by an evangelist. Jewish leaders criticized the Christian cancellation as potentially offensive. The special postmark, which also contains a small cross, will last six weeks and was paid for by <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Slennet </PERSON>, who sells religious literature at two bookstores in <LOCATION> Southend-on-Sea </LOCATION>, east of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. He said <PERSON> God </PERSON> told him to buy the postmark. The state-owned Post Office said <PERSON> Slennet </PERSON> paid the equivalent of $ 88,500 for the privilege of having every letter mailed through 68 of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s 69 sorting offices with the <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> message. <PERSON> Rustin </PERSON> said groups seeking the special cancellations have to pay $ 900 for the engraving of the cancellation plus about $ 100 for each canceling die to be used. For a large post office many dies can be required, <PERSON> Rustin </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Pentagon Considering Staff Cuts at `Stars &amp; Stripes'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Pentagon officials are studying a reorganization plan for the `` <ORGANIZATION> Stars </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Stripes'' military newspapers that could change their printing schedules, introduce advertising and cut back on staff. The reorganization plan, proposed to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> last fall by an advisory task force but only recently released publicly, is now being studied by the European and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Commands </LOCATION>, where the two newspapers are published. The top military leaders of those commands are to file comments with the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> within the next week or so, allowing <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials to make some final decisions on the fate of the two newspapers, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. Ultimately, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, the assistant <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary for public affairs, will decide whether to change the newspapers' operation in consultation with <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> The internal review comes at a time when the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> is conducting an independent investigation of alleged censorship by military commanders at the papers. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, at the prodding of Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, D-Wis., ordered that investigation last December and is likely to study closely any reorganization plan The newspapers are published for American servicemen posted overseas and date back to publication in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> during World War I. The papers' chief goal is to provide the same national and international news available in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to troops assigned to foreign countries. Although frequently referred to as one newspaper, there are two separate editions of the Stars and Stripes, published by autonomous bureaus in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The papers are staffed by military as well as civilian journalists and report to the commanders of the European and <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commands </ORGANIZATION>. They are partially supported by taxpayer funds _ roughly $ 9 million in fiscal 1986. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> formed a seven-member `` <ORGANIZATION> Stars </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Stripes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'' in the fall of 1986, asking for ideas on how to make the operations more efficient. Named as chairman was Capt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON>, a longtime communications executive in private life who is also a public affairs officer in the Naval Reserve. The 55-page report produced by the <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> panel concludes that the two newspapers are `` bringing to overseas DoD personnel a balanced presentation of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and international news along with relevant DoD and Unified Command news, but at a high cost.'' `` The task force saw areas where improvement in newspaper quality and significant cost savings could be made.'' The panel said the Pentagon should consider such things as shifting from a seven-day-a-week schedule to a six-day-a-week schedule; consolidation of management and procurement; paring expenses on wire services by subscribing to only one; investing in modern text-editing computers to improve staff efficiency; and closely reviewing staff levels in any event. The newspapers are published in a similar fashion, yet the editorial staff of the European edition is twice that of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> edition _ 87 to 41, the panel found. `` The task force came away with the distinct impression that the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stars </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Stripes, and possibly the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stars </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Stripes, editorial departments were overstaffed,'' the report states. Most importantly, it is time to re-think the restrictions that prevent the newspapers from accepting most forms of advertising, the panel insisted. The two papers rely now primarily on their 25-cent subscription charge. The report said: `` The task force believes that the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the DoD must come to grips with the practical reality of what a newspaper is _ namely a manufactured product that conveys news and other information, including advertising information. ... `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and DoD must apply that reality to the Stars and Stripes so that the papers may better serve their readers and become economically secure with a reduced need of appropriated funds.'' If the government is not willing to do that, `` it should either resign itself to continued appropriated fund support ... or get out of the daily newspaper business,'' the panel concluded.

<HEAD>Despite Criticism, Gephardt's Trade Message Seems To Be Working</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> stood in the bright sunshine on the steps of the Capitol building and delivered the message that has carried him to the front rank of the Democratic presidential field. It was tough talk about trade and the problems of American workers. His critics call <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s message protectionist. They decry the undeniable fact that this <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> insider is running against the establishment. But the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman appears to be getting a positive response. No other candidate has a message that has caught hold so effectively with a large portion of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> electorate. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> may fall short in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. The party may turn to Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' technocratic appeal, to Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>'s tough defense and foreign policy message or to <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s anti-establishment platform But <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s strong run for the nomination already has delivered a message to the the party, one that might outlive his candidacy. A strong tribute to the <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> message came in the Republican presidential debate in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> last Sunday when Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> turned to <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and accused him of sounding `` just like <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>.'' When <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> campaigns in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> he unabashedly supports legislation to restrict textile imports. So does <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. The reason is simple. Over 45 percent of the jobs in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> are in the textile industry and the state has lost 126 plants. A staple of the Gepardt message is reference to an editorial in the Wall Street Journal that referred to the trade deficits as `` just a fact of life.'' Then he said he'd like the editorial writer to come with him to <LOCATION> Bettendorff </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, where 6,000 workers in three different industries have recently lost their jobs because of foreign competition. `` Sit across the table as I did from live human beings and have them tell you what it's like to lose their life insurance, lose their health insurance, lose their pension, what it's like to go home and tell their families that they've lost their jobs, that they're going to stand in an unemployment line or a welfare line, to tell them it's just a fact of life,'' he said. He referred to electronics workers in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and textile workers in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and said, `` Ladies and gentlemen, I do n't like those facts of life. He said it was time for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to `` get control of our economic destiny,'' a powerful message to Americans who feel uneasy over the nation's enormous trade deficits. Four years ago, Republicans derided as protectionist, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>'s call for legislation that would require a certain portion of foreign products to be manufactured in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, so-called domestic content legislation. The label stuck. It was special interest legislation, a bad thing for the country. But during the four years since that election, the situation has not improved and more and more people are feeling they are a part of that special interest. Two former governors of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McNair </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> _ stood with <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> on the Capitol steps and endorsed his candidacy. Both felt compelled to defend the congressman against charges he is protectionist. <PERSON> McNair </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> has `` faced up to putting <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> first with a fair, sound and sensible trade bill. ... It is not a piece of protectionist legislation as some have tried to portray it, but it is what is best for this country.'' `` <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> has spoken out during this campaign on trade and some have referred to him as a protectionist,'' said <PERSON> Riley </PERSON>. `` He's not a protectionist at all, he's a pragmatist.

And the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign has prepared anti-Gephardt ads that communications director <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dach </PERSON> described this way: `` He says he is leading the little guy's fight, but his campaign is financed and supported by the big guys His biggest contributors are <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s biggest corporations.'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watch </ORGANIZATION>, which issued the report, is the legislative arm of Public Citizen, the liberal organization founded in 1971 by consumer advocate <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON>. The group based its report on <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> documents from October 1987 and campaign contributions through Jan. 31 of this year. Monday night, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> took <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> to task for accepting PAC contributions while `` racing around the country beating up on the establishment.'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said he had often voted against the policies advocated by his contributors and `` to suggest that people have voted according to the wishes of people who have given them money, I just think is out of touch with reality. I have n't done that and I know you have n't done that.'' But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s contention that he ignored the wishes of his contributors was unrealistic. `` Lobbyists would lose their jobs if they gave money continuously against the interests of who they were working for,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. Among contributors to <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s campaign were the Builders <ORGANIZATION> PAC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, $ 5,000; <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, $ 5,000; <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, $ 2,500; <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, $ 1,000, and <PERSON> E.F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON>, $ 1,500. Election law limits each PAC to contributions of no more than $ 5,000 to any one candidate, in contrast to the limit for individual contributions of $ 1,000. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> received contributions from PACs representing <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bottling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, $ 2,500; <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, $ 1,000; the <ORGANIZATION> Sheet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, $ 5,000, and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Telesis </LOCATION>, $ 1,500. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> PAC </ORGANIZATION> contributors included <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, $ 5,000; <ORGANIZATION> H </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; R Block, $ 1,000; <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION>, $ 5,000; <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION>, $ 5,000, and <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>, $ 2,000.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> surged closer to pre-crash levels today, setting a new 1988 record for volume, while the dollar fell slightly. `` Foreign buying and a bullish economy in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have convinced domestic investors to join in,'' said a market analyst who requested anonymity, adding that the strength of the market has been surprising. `` Latecomers have been trying to catch the bus. I would be concerned if turnover like today's continued, though, because it could show that the market is overheating,'' he said. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues closed at 25,682.82 points, up 246.92 points, or 0.97 percent from Tuesday's close Volume in the first section was 1.7 billion shares, a record high for this year. On the foreign exchange market, the dollar closed at 128.47 yen, down 0.16 yen from Tuesday's close of 128.63 yen. The dollar opened today at 128.43 yen. A currency dealer at a major commercial bank in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said the dollar was trading in a narrow range in the absence of major market-moving news. Trading on the first section of the exchange totaled 900 million shares at the end of the morning session, before closing the day 100 million shares higher than the previous 1988 record, set Tuesday. Prior to the October crash, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> index stood at 25,746.56. `` Institutional investors are responding positively to the favorable outlook for the economic performance of Japanese firms in this fiscal year,'' said <PERSON> Hiromi </PERSON> <PERSON> Yoneyama </PERSON>, a dealer with <ORGANIZATION> Wako </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Yoneyama </PERSON> said corporate earnings of major firms were expected to show better-than-expected results in fiscal 1987, which ends March 31.

<HEAD>League Of Women Voters Cancels Presidential Debates In Nashville</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The League of Women Voters called off Democratic and Republican debates scheduled for Sunday after presidential candidates in both parties showed little or no interest in attending. `` In essence, the candidates are snubbing nearly half the country two days before this critical election,'' said <PERSON> Carole </PERSON> <PERSON> Bucy </PERSON>, president of the League of Women Voters of <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>. The debates, which were to have been telecast from <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, would have come only two days before the 20-state round of caucuses and primaries on March 8, or Super Tuesday. League spokeswoman <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON> had said earlier in the day the Democratic debate was definitely on and the Republican debate would proceed even if there were only two candidates. The cancellation followed indications by Republican <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> that he was unlikely to join <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> for a two-man debate. In <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> spoke to a downtown rally, press secretary <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Riker </PERSON> said he doubted seriously that <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> would participate in the rally without Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, a former television evangelist, both advised the League they would not show up. Ms. <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON> said Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> `` told us this week he did not want to debate in -LRB- <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. -RRB- <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s back yard, even though he has known all along the debate was in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>.'' Ms. <PERSON> Bucy </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had decided not to participate. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s chief campaign spokesman, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON>, chided <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> passing up the debates here. Both of them also skipped a debate last Sunday in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` participated fully in the debates that preceded the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses. Now these same candidates are dodging these -LRB- <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> -RRB- debates where they have to talk about the issues.'' Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who has said he would not campaign actively in Southern-dominated Super Tuesday states, was apparently planning on taking part in the <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> debate. Other Democrats in the running are <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and former <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>.

Delegates</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> picked up a delegate and another was slated uncommitted as <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential delegation selection process got under way. Republicans in two counties met Tuesday to select two of the state's 18 delegates to the Republican National Convention. Most of the rest of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> delegates and 13 of the state's 18 <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> delegates will be selected Saturday, three days before Super Tuesday. Despite the emphasis on campaigning in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> was getting some attention from the candidates. Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> both planned stops in the state before Saturday's county conventions. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, who is from neighboring <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, has visited. Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> bought radio ads in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, the first time a candidate has advertised his candidacy over the airwaves. None of the Republican candidates were expected in the state, where Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> were considered the frontrunners. <PERSON> Natrona </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Platte </LOCATION> counties were the first to allocate presidential delegates Tuesday, with eight other counties ready to select their <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> delegates on Saturday. The <LOCATION> Natrona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> delegate, <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Catchpole </PERSON>, said she was committed to <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>; the <LOCATION> Platte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> pick, <ORGANIZATION> Natty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION>, was uncommitted. <LOCATION> Weston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Republicans planned to choose their delegate Friday and <LOCATION> Niobrara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> party members were to do the same on March 12. The final six presidential delegates will be selected at the state Republican convention on May 7 in <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION>. All 23 Democratic presidential delegates will be selected Saturday at county conventions throughout the state. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> already received the support of former Gov. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Herschler </PERSON> and another of the state's five `` super delegates,'' who can remain uncommitted going into the Democratic National Convention in July.

 Former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said there's an even chance that none of the Democratic presidential candidates will have a lock on the party's nomination before the national convention in July. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, who has not endorsed any of the candidates, received a visit Tuesday from one of the hopefuls, Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, who characterized the meeting as a non-political call on `` an old friend.'' `` My hope is that out of the primary and caucus season will come a clear winner,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said just one week before 20 states, most of them south of the Mason-Dixon line, hold primaries and caucuses with 1,307 delegates at stake. `` I'm not sure that's a likelihood now,'' he said. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> made it clear he is not one of those waiting for some other candidate to enter the race _ a <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> or even <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>. `` I would not personally favor turning to someone outside the active candidate group for the nomination,'' said the former president. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> explained his decision not to endorse any of the party's contenders, saying `` it is better for us not to take a preferential position among the Democratic candidates. He said the only Democrat he might have thrown his support behind was <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, who decided against entering the race. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> talked about the Democratic race and Super Tuesday after meeting at his rambling brick home with <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, one of six Democratic aspirants for the presidency. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> denied he had any political motive for his trip to this tiny <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> town <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> put on the map. `` I did n't come here to try to be helped on Super Tuesday,'' said <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, who stopped in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> on a trip from <LOCATION> Williamsburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION> `` I came here today not to enhance my prospects, but to greet an old friend,'' he said. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Rosalynn </PERSON>, stood on the front walk of the former president's home at 1 <LOCATION> Woodland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION>. His hair much whiter than when he left the White House in January 1981, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> wore an open-necked checked shirt, a tweed jacket and khaki pants. Asked if he missed all the attention of a political campaign, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> laughed and said he and his wife had just returned from skiing in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. But he was also willing to answer questions as long as reporters had any to ask. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> was careful to say something nice about all the Democratic candidates, and suggested that any one of them could do well in the South. `` I'm sure Sen. -LRB- <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> -LRB- of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> -RRB- will have an advantage among some voters because he's a Southerner,'' said <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. The former president's daughter, <PERSON> Amy </PERSON>, has endorsed <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` Amy does n't ask me for counsel,'' he said, when asked if she had discussed her position with him.

 <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> women extended their reign over the Miss <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> pageant to a fourth consecutive year as a beaming <PERSON> Courtney </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> took the crown in a contest marred by arrests, an assault and protests. Pageant spokeswoman <PERSON> Stacy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sacco </PERSON> said she was stunned by the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> victory record and felt compelled to assure reporters Tuesday night that the contest televised nationally by <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> was not rigged. The woman who started the winning streak in 1985, <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez-Herring </PERSON> of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, did a little jig after Ms. <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> was crowned, and echoed the sentiments of many pageant-watchers: `` I just feel sorry for the next Miss <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.'' Ms. <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON>, a 21-year-old junior at <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, smiled broadly when outgoing Miss USA <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Royer </PERSON> of <PERSON> Keller </PERSON> put the crown on her head. `` It feels fabulous,'' the blue-eyed brunette said calmly, seemingly unsurprised by her victory. `` One of the gifts <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Royer </PERSON> -RRB- gave me was a dictionary with the word ` impossible' whited out. So of course it was possible,'' she said. The pageant made the news weeks before the coronation: <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> ended his 21-year reign as host to protest the awarding of furs to the winner and use of furs during the show. The first two Miss Minnesotas bowed out after it was disclosed they had been arrested. Animal-rights protesters picketed the El Paso Convention Center. And co-host <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> <PERSON> Scoggins </PERSON> fought off an attacker in a hotel elevator. Ms. <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> beat <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Magana </PERSON>, 22, of Rancho <PERSON> Palos </PERSON> <PERSON> Verdes </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, who was first runner-up. It was one of two best possible results for <ORGANIZATION> Guyrex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paso </ORGANIZATION>, the company that produces the Miss Texas-USA and Miss California-USA contests and hones those winners' pageant skills for the Miss USA contest.

 Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> home ground, triumphed in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>'s `` beauty contest'' primary, but <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> had reason to celebrate as well as the presidential pack headed into the final days of the Super Tuesday campaign `` Our message continues to win,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> exulted after finishing a strong second in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, which has only a tiny black population. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> garnered 26 percent to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' 57 percent. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, outspent and out-organized, nonetheless made an impressive showing, gaining 39 percent to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 49 percent in what his campaign called the vice president's `` back yard.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has a summer home in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. Still, the vice president pronounced himself pleased. `` This win gives us three out of three in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, and I'm hopeful we can be as successful this Saturday in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and on Super Tuesday,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who was campaigning in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> No delegates were at stake in the Tuesday primary. Delegate selection begins at local caucuses next month and representatives of the <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> campaign said they would work now on organizing for the caucuses. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, fresh from a weekend win in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> caucus, was buoyant about his victory. `` It's terrific, we're rolling'em up,'' said the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, who was campaigning in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. With a strong organization and the endorsement of Gov. <PERSON> Madeleine </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had been expected to do well here. Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, who has been <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' chief opponent in some recent contests, trailed with 8 percent. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> backers said his poor showing was caused by a lack of spendng in the state by his national campaign. `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> both made a decision to compete,'' said Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s state chairman. `` You ca n't overcome national organizations with just a <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> organization. Some political observers had predicted a tight race between <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> for second place, but <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> stole the show. He ran a strong second in the state's largest city of <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> and actually beat <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in 27 communities and tied him in two. `` We have found the common chord that is linking the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> from his mother's home in <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION> `` It's putting to rest once and for all that he is candidate for black people,'' said <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> backer. `` We are the whitest state in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. I think it's an extraordinary showing.'' In unofficial results, with 100 percent of the state's 262 precincts reporting, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had 28,244 votes or 57 percent; <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> 13,030 votes or 26 percent; <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> 3,968 votes or 8 percent; <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> 2,596 votes or 5 percent and <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> 2,052 votes or 4 percent. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> received 23,550 or 49 percent; <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> got 18,636 or 39 percent; former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> 2,447 votes or 5 percent; Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> 1,866 votes or 4 percent. Dropouts <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> received 794 votes, or 2 percent and 327 votes or 1 percent respectively. The <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> campaigns put up little effort in the state, although <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> plans to compete in the caucuses. `` I really did n't contest it,'' said <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> `` We had virtually no organization in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>.'' In years past, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>'s primary won national media attention because of its timing. Candidates could use a victory in the state to build momentum following a victories in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. Or, they could try to repair an image wounded by a loss in either of those two states. But the timing element worked against the state this year. Because no delegates were being allocated, the candidates practically ignored the state to concentrate on the mega-delegate race in the South. The primary was part of the state's annual ritual, Town Meeting Day, when <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>'s voters decided town budgets, road repairs and a host of other local issues. Turnout was lower than expected, with just under 100,000 venturing to the polls.

 <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> residents used their annual town meetings to bolster efforts to save family farms and grapple with growth. One town voted to exempt silos from property taxes and another declared its population growth rate too high. The votes Tuesday reflected concern that <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>'s rural heritage is being gobbled up by condominiums, resort developments and vacation homes. That issue was the focus of a special commission created by Gov. <PERSON> Madeleine </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunin </PERSON> that recommended a comprehensive package of legislation to control growth and save open land. The town meetings, a mainstay of local government in which residents vote on town budgets and perennial issues such as road repairs, took up the growth controversy during debates of zoning regulations, expansions of planning staffs and other proposals. Pawlet residents voted 249-178 to exempt farm silos from the property tax, though proponents ackowledged it would mean a savings of only $ 200 a year for each of the town's 17 farms. `` It's going to be a combination of these little things that keep the farmers going,'' said state Rep. <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Wallingford </LOCATION>, residents tried to go even further, approving a proposal to exempt local farms from paying any property tax on farm land or buildings. For technical reasons the vote was not binding, said <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON>. `` We determined, though, the selectmen have the authority to institute this program,'' he said. `` And I think there's support for it. I'm for it.'' In <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION>, residents were asked to recommend a preferred population growth rate for the community, ranging from 0.66 percent, the highest annual growth rate the town had between 1890 and 1970, to 2.5 percent, the average so far this decade. They opted for the middle range of 0.9 percent, far below the present growth rate. `` If the populace makes it loud and clear it does n't want rapid growth, perhaps the town could control growth by setting up certain conservation areas, or by steering patterns of development and population densities,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiggin </PERSON>, a member of a group studying growth in the community. Growth was n't the only issue on the minds of voters at town meetings. In <LOCATION> Corinth </LOCATION>, the question of the day was whether the tiny hamlet at the town center is called <LOCATION> Cookville </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Cookeville </LOCATION>. Town Clerk <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Learmonth </PERSON> had asked for the vote because of disagreements throughout history. `` Henceforth, it will be <LOCATION> Cookeville </LOCATION>,'' he said following the vote.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackon </PERSON> returned to his boyhood hometown as he headed down the home stretch to the Super Tuesday showdown, buoyed by another strong showing in a northern state. `` Our message continues to win,'' the Democratic presidential candidate said when he learned Tuesday night that he had finished second in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>'s `` beauty contest'' primary. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was surrounded by family, staff and reporters enjoying a home-cooked Southern style meal when word of his showing reached him. `` We have found the common chord that is linking the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people where they are in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is hoping that the inroads he has made among white voters in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> _ all states with 1 percent or less black voting age population _ will continue in the March 8 series of primaries across 20 states, most of them in the South. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is expected to run well on Super Tuesday, especially in the deep South with its heavy black population. But the campaign also is targeting the working class, students, gays and other minorities. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> acknowledged upon arriving in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, which holds its primary Saturday, that the South is different than the states that have voted so far. But he said, `` I'm a son of the South ... I know the South and its ways.'' He said his message _ attacking multinational corporations and appealing to the economically oppressed _ would remain the same as he campaigns in the South. Arriving at the <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION> airport, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> highlighted the plight of textile workers who have been hurt by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry taking its operations overseas. He said that when he was a youth, <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION> was the textile capital of the world and was filled with mills, now closed down. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said the customs laws must be enforced to keep foreign products from entering the country illegally, and he called for adjustment of the exchange rates by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> so those nations can not receive inflated prices on their goods. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also defended his leadership qualifications which have come under attack from Democratic rival <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> because <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has never held an elected or appointive government post. Speaking to a Baptist convention at the <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Baptist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Church </LOCATION> where his mother sang in the choir when he was a boy, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> repeated his oft-stated claim that he knows the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people better than any other candidate. He also gave a litany of foreign leaders he has met, labor strikes he has mediated and civil rights causes he has championed. `` I'm not propped up by aides,'' he said, adding that he can speak to the poor because `` I was born in the underclass.'' Earlier, in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> met with the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> ambassador to protest <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>'s new clampdown of anti-apartheid factions and arrest of dissident religious leaders, including Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told a news conference later that the ambassador, <PERSON> Piet </PERSON> <PERSON> G.J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Koornhof </PERSON>, asked for a follow-up meeting with Rep. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Dellums </PERSON>, D-Calif., who attended the meeting and who is sponsoring legislation on sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> because of its apartheid policy of racial separation The ambassador did not join <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dellums </PERSON> at the news conference. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporations and banks should be ordered to leave <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. And he called on the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to convene special <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> session international support for full sanctions against <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>. He also called for suupport of the frontline states around <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and aid in constructing trade corridors so <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> would not be dependent on South African trade routes. He said he had phoned national security adviser <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> and urged that the issue be raised with <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> allies. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> told him there was `` a sense of outrage'' in the administration about the recent crackdown in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would so state if the matter was brought up at the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> meeting.

 A pop-up scarecrow and a snowplow-proof mailbox were just some of the gizmos displayed at the second-annual <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dakota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inventors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Konzak </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Devils </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> rummaged through the clutter of his briefcase and found a letter to prove his scarecrow has already earned him some attention. `` I am still invited to the <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> show.

Forty inventors and manufacturers, most of them from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, showed off their gadgets and thingamajigs at the show, which ended Tuesday. The hinged mailbox was devised by a <LOCATION> Minot </LOCATION> man after a neighbor complained about his mailbox getting knocked down by snowplows each winter. <PERSON> Konzak </PERSON>'s pride and joy stood at one side of his booth on the floor of the Jamestown Civic Center. It's a steel contraption wearing fluorescent work gloves that sports a dummy's head adorned with a cowboy hat. A battery and propane tank give it life.

<HEAD>Mail Bearing `Jesus Is Alive' Postmark Delivered Today</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The Post Office today began delivering mail bearing the postmark `` Jesus is Alive!'' throughout <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, a move that Jews, humanists, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Secular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> and others called offensive to other beliefs. `` It is absolutely outrageous,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Horwood </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humanist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a national organization for the non-religious. `` Imagine the furor if we had asked to have ` <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> is Dead' printed on hundreds of millions of letters We might think these things privately, but they should not be forced on everybody else in such an insensitive way,'' he said. <PERSON> Horwood </PERSON> said he is writing to <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> chairman Sir <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON> asking for the postmark to be withdrawn. Christian evangelist <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Slennet </PERSON> privately financed the arrangement with the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Slennet </PERSON>, 41, sells Christian literature at two bookstores in <LOCATION> Southend-on-Sea </LOCATION>, east of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. He said <PERSON> God </PERSON> told him to buy the postmark. The six-week arrangement runs through Good Friday, April 1, when Christians mourn the crucifixion of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> and Easter Sunday, April 3, when they celebrate his resurrection. Slennet was quoted by the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> as saying he was convinced `` the Lord will speak to the nation'' through the scheme, which he said was designed to mark Easter. `` We are not trying to offend people in any way,'' the paper quoted <PERSON> Slennet </PERSON> as saying. But <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, spokesman for Lord <PERSON> Jakobovits </PERSON>, the chief rabbi of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, said: `` It could well cause offense and resentment. We've made our feelings known to the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>.'' The state-run Post Office began using the postmark on mail Tuesday and the first deliveries of mail bearing it began today. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Smoker </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Secular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, said she was enraged by the slogan, which she condemned as insensitive `` propaganda.'' Press reports quoted Ms. <PERSON> Smoker </PERSON>, 64, as saying that 26 percent of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s 56 million population are atheists or agnostics and that the society exists to defend their rights. Ms. <PERSON> Smoker </PERSON> was quoted as saying she plans to retaliate by stamping her own slogan `` <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> is a Myth'' on every envelope she mails. <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said: `` The printing of this slogan in no way confirms <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> approval of its contents. The slogan is not considered to be contentious but a fair and reasonable message generally acceptable to the public.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Slennet </PERSON>, who belongs to an evangelical group called Intercessors for <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, paid $ 88,500 for the privilege of having every letter mailed through 68 of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s 69 sorting offices stamped postmark `` Jesus is Alive!'' The 69th office, in <LOCATION> Plymouth </LOCATION>, is already booked for a slogan celebrating <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588.

Revenue-boosting private-slogan postmarks usually urge support for health-research charities and other worthy causes. The postmark before the `` Jesus is Alive!'' slogan was a Post Office message reading `` Pass on your Postcode.'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said the chief rabbi's office was `` flooded with phone calls'' after news of the slogan appeared Tuesday. `` We recognize that this is a Christian country and we have the utmost respect for the primacy for the church,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>.

 Cocaine now is the most visible target in the war on drugs, a battle that a congressional report says is costing society tens of billions of dollars a year in lost wages, law enforcement outlays and treatment programs. A study of recent changes in the drug trade by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` Cocaine has emerged as the widely abused drug of greatest concern.'' Marijuana use has been declining, the report said, while various substances known as designer drugs have emerged as a significant phenomenon. Some highlights of `` Controlling Drug Abuse: A Status Report,'' include: _ In 1983 alone, drugs cost <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> society some $ 59.7 billion in crime, lost employment, criminal justice spending, prisons, reduced productivity and treatment programs _ The number of cocaine-related emergencies reported by hospitals jumped 167 percent from 1983 to 1986 _ The share of high school seniors who admitted ever having used cocaine fell from 16.9 percent in 1986 to 15.2 percent in 1987 However, some experts fear this may not include all those using the newly popular `` crack'' form of cocaine, which is smoked and is highly popular among young people. _ Heroin seems to be widely available across the country The number of heroin-related hospital emergencies rose 24 percent from 1983 to 1986. _ Marijuana use has declined, although it remains the most widely used illegal drug in the country An estimated 61.9 million people over age 12 have used this drug at least once. _ <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> is the cocaine consumption capital of the nation, although PCP and heroin are also popular and it's a transshipment point for Mexican heroin _ <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> is the cocaine importation center, with many homicides related to the drug trade The spread of the disease AIDS is being added to by the use of drug needles. _ <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> has become a center for the importation of heroin and has the nation's largest heroin addict population with the spread of AIDS also a major problem The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> heroin trade is dominated by <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> immigrants. _ <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> faces a major problem with LSD and methamphetamines, with growing use of heroin and cocaine _ Cocaine availability has increased sharply in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, where PCP also is used heavily A high per capita overdose rate is reported in the nation's capital. _ <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> too is facing rising cocaine use

 Mayor <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Vezzetti </PERSON>, the badly dressed bootlegger's son who took to the streets with a bullhorn to win elections and fight the gentrification of this <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> city </LOCATION>, died early today. He was 59. <PERSON> Vezzetti </PERSON> died of a heart attack at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> shortly after midnight, police said. <PERSON> Vezzetti </PERSON>, a lifelong bachelor, was said to have been angry Tuesday night by the outcome of a special election in the 5th Ward. A councilman who frequently criticized <PERSON> Vezzetti </PERSON>'s policies won a special election over a candidate supported by the mayor. Officials said that at about 11 p.m. Tuesday neighbors heard <PERSON> Vezzetti </PERSON> fall in his apartment and they called for an ambulance. City Business Administrator <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Chius </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> would meet later today to choose a successor to head this city of 42,000. Before <PERSON> Vezzetti </PERSON>'s election to public office, he had developed a reputation as an eccentric, sometimes wearing mismatched shoes, orange pants and a Hawaiian shirt. His face was often unshaven and he sometimes carried his belongings in two paper bags. He also was a political gadfly, showing up at school board and city council meetings, complaining about the waste of taxpayers' money He took a bullhorn in 1982 and walked up and down <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, the city's main artery, to announce he was challenging the city council president in the next election. He won, and then used the tactic against Mayor <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cappiello </PERSON> in 1985, hitting on the theme of stopping yuppies from sweeping the working and middle class out of the city across the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. `` If you want to stay in <LOCATION> Hoboken </LOCATION>, vote for me,'' he often said. He forced <PERSON> Cappiello </PERSON> into a runoff, and the mayor questioned <PERSON> Vezzetti </PERSON>'s mental competence and wardrobe. `` Clothes do not make the man,'' <PERSON> Vezzetti </PERSON> said at a campaign debate. And he beat the three-term mayor in a major upset. Supporters literally carried him to City Hall. His longtime motto was `` It's not that I'm so good. It's just that they're so bad.'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> <PERSON> Vezzetti </PERSON> and his twin sister, <PERSON> Louise </PERSON>, were born in 1928. He once described his father as a `` bootlegger'' who owned five saloons. The mayor's mother was an heiress to a peanuts and dried fruits fortune. `` That's where I get my campaign money from,'' Vezzetti once told <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monthly </ORGANIZATION>. `` He was one of a kind,'' said Police Chief <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Crimmins </PERSON>. `` It'll be a long time before he can be replaced.''

<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Bands of teen-agers taunted police and erected barricades in the capital's streets today as a 36-hour nationwide general strike protesting parliamentary elections got under way. Police and paramilitary troops patrolled the city's streets, which were nearly empty of traffic, and guarded main intersections. Shops and businesses were shuttered and most bus, train and ferry service was canceled. Government offices were closed because authorities had declared today and Thursday, the day of the elections, holidays. Major opposition parties called the strike in an attempt to disrupt the balloting, which they are boycotting and claim will be rife with fraud. Voters are to choose <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>'s fourth Parliament in 17 years of independence. President <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> announced the elections in December when he dissolved Parliament in an effort to end an opposition campaign seeking his ouster that began Nov. 10. <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>, a 58-year-old former army general, seized power in this nation of 105 million people in a 1982 bloodless coup. He was elected president in 1986 in balloting the opposition said was rigged. <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> was generally calm this morning, but small groups of youths briefly stoned police in some parts of the city during the afternoon. Four people were reported admitted to <ORGANIZATION> Dhaka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> suffering minor injuries from homemade bombs. Youths stopped a municipal garbage truck, smashed it with sticks and clubs and set it ablaze. Downtown, protesters threw up barricades of broken bricks, which riot police later removed. On a street across from police headquarters, a police van was briefly stoned, but there was no confrontation between attackers and police. Near the city's main bus station, a band of about 70 youths marched through the streets chanting `` strike, strike.'' Police in riot helmets watched from trucks. The government also called in 9,000 soldiers to guard against election-day violence. The mainstream opposition of 21 parties is boycotting the balloting, but between eight and 102 political parties are vying for Parliament's 300 seats. The two main opposition leaders, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasina </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Awami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Khaleda </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>, warned that Thursday's vote would trigger more bloodshed. Pre-election violence has claimed at least eight lives, including that of a candidate who was gunned down by suspected anti-government protesters. During Feb. 10 local elections, more than 100 people were killed, by government count. The unofficial estimate is as high as 500. Since the campaign seeking <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>'s ouster began, at least 25 people have been killed in police clashes with mobs.

 A moderate earthquake hit the south flank of <LOCATION> Kilauea </LOCATION> but was unrelated to the volcano's continuing eruption that began five years ago, scientists said. There were no reports of injuries or damage from Tuesday night's quake, according to police The temblor measured 4.5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Delaney </PERSON>, a geologist at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Survey </ORGANIZATION>'s Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, The earthquake, which struck at 10:42 p.m. -LRB- 3:42 a.m. EST today -RRB-, was centered six miles below the surface of the volcano to the southwest of where lava has been pouring from the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> since the summer of 1986, <PERSON> Delaney </PERSON> said. The quake was not strong enough to generate a Pacific-wide tsunami, or tidal wave, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tsunami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. `` It did n't even rattle the china,'' <PERSON> Delaney </PERSON> said.

 <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has begun urging the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to play a larger role in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and to work for a settlement of the conflict in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, four <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> scholars said after returning from two weeks in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. Three said the push indicated that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> was changing and wanted to improve relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The fourth said <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> was just putting into practice the old <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> proverb: `` Using barbarians to control barbarians.'' The four <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> specialists spoke at a briefing Tuesday sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Henry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Luce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, which supported their trip from Dec. 29 to Jan. 11. In all, seven American `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> hands'' took part in the trip, which included stays in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Minh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, once known as <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION>, and talks with high-ranking Vietnamese officials. <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Chauncey </PERSON>, a professor of history at <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s preoccupation with its loss of the Vietnam War and with the POW-MIA issue was hampering its ability to respond to a changing <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. `` We have to stop letting the past determine our actions in the region,'' agreed <PERSON> Brantly </PERSON> <PERSON> Womack </PERSON>, a professor of political science at <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Rand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION>, was not as optimistic about the changes in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> or about the prospects for peace in <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> contended that the fighting in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> was still a `` sideshow'' in a larger struggle between the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and its ally <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. It will remain the scene of violence until the larger powers can sort out their problems, he said. <PERSON> Frederic </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakeman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a history professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, said he was impressed by changing Vietnamese society, citing Beatles songs played on a flight from <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> and the raffish tilt of berets on the heads of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials. `` We were astonished again and again by the candor of the Vietnamese,'' <PERSON> Wakeman </PERSON> said. `` Intellectuals, officials, party members were all very open.'' As a <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> scholar, <PERSON> Wakeman </PERSON> said, he was particularly interested in the entrepreneurial spirit of the ethnic Chinese in <LOCATION> Ho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Minh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` We had the sense in <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION> of a commercial economy waiting to break loose,'' he said. <PERSON> Chauncey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Womack </PERSON> said a combination of circumstances has given <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> a chance for a new beginning in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. For the first time, <PERSON> Womack </PERSON> said, Vietnamese officials, including Foreign Minister and Vice Premier <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Co </PERSON> <PERSON> Thach </PERSON>, are talking with eagerness about leaving <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in December 1978, kicked out the Chinese-backed <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and installed a puppet government in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>. About 140,000 Vietnamese troops remain in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> fighting a resistance coalition headed by Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> that is backed by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the free-market countries of <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. But last year, <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> split with the coalition and began direct negotiations with <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>, prime minister of the Vietnamese-backed government. <PERSON> Chauncey </PERSON> said the negotiations, supported by <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, were a sign that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> wants to end the conflict. `` Vietnamese officials told me they want the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to play an active role in negotiations to bring peace to <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>,'' she said. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> also is trying to boost its economy, in which the average annual income is about $ 125. As such, it has recognized the need for foreign exchange and investment from the West. <PERSON> Wakeman </PERSON> said he believed <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> wants an increased <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presence to counterbalance Chinese interests in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. `` In part, it's a very old diplomatic tactic of using the barbarians to control the barbarians,'' he said. <PERSON> Chauncey </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must reassert itself in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. `` If it does n't, we will be left behind in what will be a realignment of political and economic forces,'' she said.

<HEAD>TV, Movie Writers Vote Whether To Authorize Strike</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> members of the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> almost certainly voted to authorize a strike against movie and television producers, a former guild president said. The vote was taken Tuesday night in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> by secret ballot, and results were not expected to be announced until Thursday. The 9,000-member union also includes 2,500 <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> members who were scheduled to vote this afternoon. The guild's contract expired at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday. Union negotiators said a replacement contract offered by the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION> was calculated to force a strike. The negotiators unanimously urged members to reject the offer and vote instead for a strike authorization, said <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON>, a guild spokeswoman. She said 2,400 ballots were cast Tuesday night. The former guild president, <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Shavelson </PERSON>, said that judging from the sentiments he heard expressed during the balloting, `` I do n't think there was any doubt as to what the vote was.'' While a strike could begin as early as Thursday, <PERSON> Shavelson </PERSON> said it was unlikely a walkout would be called immediately. A strike could have an immediate impact on talk shows and soap operas, which use scripts daily and without much lead time. Prime-time programs and feature films would be affected only by a longer strike. Negotiators for the two sides met for just two hours before quitting Tuesday afternoon. The brief meeting followed a 21-hour session that lasted until 7:15 a.m. Tuesday and made progress on `` 25 to 30 lesser issues,'' said <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, spokesman for the producers. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> said three major stumbling blocks remained. The writers are seeking more `` creative rights'' to control what happens to their scripts and higher payments when programs are distributed in foreign markets. The producers want to give writers reduced payments for domestic syndication of one-hour television programs, a shrinking market. The entertainment writers last went on strike three years ago. The walkout lasted two weeks before writers voted to accept a package offering them essentially the same terms as one they had earlier rejected. The median annual income for guild writers is $ 40,000, but about half of the members are unemployed at any given time, the union says.

 Five thousand troops from half the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> countries were airlifted to the mountains and valleys of northern <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> in a show of unity as leaders of the alliance gathered in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> at a major strategy conference. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> transport planes on Tuesday ferried in the combat units for the maneuvers, code-named `` <ORGANIZATION> Arrowhead </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>,'' which climaxes in two weeks in a battle on snow-covered terrain against an `` enemy'' of 9,500 Norwegian forces. The exercise mobilized the <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Europe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, a brigade designed to rush to areas of potential conflict with the Soviet-led <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION>. The maneuvers were clearly intended to serve political more than military aims, and to demonstrate the cohesion of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. `` Our operational role is in peacetime, to show as many flags with as much visibility as possible in a threatened area to deter an aggressor,'' said British Maj. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaren </PERSON>. `` If we reach the combat stage, we've failed,'' he said in a telephone interview Tuesday from command headquarters in <LOCATION> Bardufoss </LOCATION>, 1,000 miles north of <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION>. Although not officially tied to the summit, the exercise dovetails with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s recent efforts to reassure <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies of the American commitment to defend <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> at the same time that it negotiates arms reductions with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The war games also coincide with mounting Norwegian concern that <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s flank in the north <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> will become more active following the U.S.-Soviet agreement to dismantle intermediate-range nuclear weapons. `` The INF agreement has made the Norwegian and the Barents Seas more important,'' <PERSON> Kaare </PERSON> <PERSON> Willoch </PERSON>, chairman of the Norwegian parliament's foreign affairs committee, said Tuesday. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has built the world's greatest concentration of firepower on the <LOCATION> Kola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> adjacent to <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s northern border. <PERSON> Willoch </PERSON>, a former conservative prime minister, said in an interview that the Soviet buildup in the north had been going on for decades and had shown no signs of slackening since the disarmament accord was signed in December. `` The buildup proceeds. It necessitates <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> countermeasures,'' while negotiations continue on further arms reduction accords, he said. The Soviet Northern Fleet, armed with submarine-launched, long-range nuclear weapons, must pass <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> to reach the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> fire zone, the closest point of deployment to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for Soviet missiles. <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s northwestern coast, kept ice-free all year by the warmth of the Gulf Stream, also becomes more attractive to the Soviets as naval warfare grows in importance in Soviet military strategy, Norwegian analysts say. One war scenario foresees the Soviets slicing off <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s remote and nearly unpopulated northern province, challenging <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s willingness to That is precisely the kind of action the Allied Command Europe Mobile Force was formed in 1960 to deter, <PERSON> McLaren </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Arrowhead </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>, commanded by Norwegian Vice Admiral Torolf Rein, involves forces from eight of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s 16 countries: the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> role in <ORGANIZATION> Arrowhead </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> is limited to air support, since its units are not trained for arctic warfare. Much of the maneuvering will be done on skis or snowmobiles, <PERSON> McLaren </PERSON> said. The force holds maneuvers twice a year, once in <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> and once along an isolated region of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s southern flank in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>.

 A military court sentenced two Polish journalists to prison after convicting them of selling information to Western intelligence agencies, a government spokesman said. <PERSON> Mariusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Dastych </PERSON>, 46, and <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Podwysocki </PERSON>, 56, both formerly worked for the official government daily newspaper Rzeczpospolita and were arrested last April on spying charges.

The court also fined Dastych $ 790 and ordered the confiscation of all his property, said Urban, speaking at his weekly news conference Tuesday. <PERSON> Podwysocki </PERSON> received a 1 -LCB- - year prison sentence because the court accepted his defense that he was `` unaware that information he had communicated was used for intelligence purposes,'' Urban said <PERSON> Podwysocki </PERSON>, one of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s best-known economic reporters, also was barred from working as a journalist for two years, fined $ 530 and ordered to pay back all the Western currency he had received for the information.

 Nuclear waste shipments from the crippled <LOCATION> Three </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> plant will be temporarily halted while the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> completes its investigation into a rail switching incident in the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> area, according to Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>. Meanwhile, Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Buechner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Mo </LOCATION>., has introduced legislation that would require casks used by the DOE to ship radioactive waste to meet safety standards set by the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>, R-Mo., said Tuesday the <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to stop the shipments from <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> to a laboratory in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, until the investigation is completed He said he did n't know how long the probe would take to complete. <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>, ranking minority member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, last week requested the investigation into whether there were violations of rail regulations Feb. 9 when a mislabeled car was added to a <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> train carrying casks of radioactive wastes. The covered hopper car carried a placard stating it contained a flammable material, <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Loftus </PERSON> said last week. It was later discovered the car was not carrying the dangerous cargo. <PERSON> Loftus </PERSON> said the investigation is looking at possible violations by the rail switching yard and the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION>, which operated the train after it left the yard, and a lime company that was shipping the car. <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> said Tuesday the <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION> had agreed to allow the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> to make a complete study of the routes used to transport the <ORGANIZATION> TMI </ORGANIZATION> material. The Energy Department has done such studies in the past but has always concluded that the route from <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> was the best. A request by <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> not to move rail shipments in the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> area between the hours of 6:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. _ commuter rush hours _ also was agreed to by the DOE. Other agreements by the DOE included a promise not to add cars to <ORGANIZATION> TMI </ORGANIZATION> trains along the route. The trains, which leave <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> under <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> power, will continue to switch to Union Pacific when necessary but no cars will be added, <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> said. As a way to minimize the total number of shipments, all future shipments will be consolidated into three casks, <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> said. According to a statement by <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>'s office, other agreements made by the DOE include:

 _ <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> will assign a certified hazardous materials inspector at the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, yard to assist with mechanical inspections and managers will be assigned at crew change points, inspection points and en route to monitor speed and times of day schedules through <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>.

 A jetliner returned to <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> after a passenger was found in a lavatory with crack and equipment to burn it for `` freebasing,'' authorities said.

<HEAD>Soldier Kills Seven Sleeping Comrades Before Being Shot Dead</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Sri Lankan soldier opened fire with a semi-automatic rifle and killed seven sleeping comrades before he was shot to death by his commander, military officials said today. Nine other soldiers were wounded in the Tuesday night attack at an army camp next to a steel mill 10 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, they said. The attacker was a member of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, an ultra-nationalist Sinhalese group that has raided several military camps to steal weapons, the officials said. The officials, who by regulation can not be identified, said the attack was designed to kill as many soldiers as possible and to steal weapons. They said all the victims were Sinhalese, the majority ethnic group that controls the government and military in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. The officials were unable to explain why the assailant risked making so much noise by gunning down fellow soldiers if the purpose of the attack was to collect weapons and escape. A vehicle had arrived at the scene to enable the attacker to make his getaway, they said, but the escape was foiled when the commanding officer heard the shooting, rushed to the scene and killed the soldier. The driver escaped in the vehicle, the officials said. Neither the soldier nor his commander was identified, but the officials said they both served in a signal corps unit. According to the officials, similar attacks have occurred in the past but this was the largest number of soldiers ever killed by a fellow soldier. The government has blamed the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the assassinations of at least 150 government officials and supporters since July 29, when <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> signed a peace accord designed to end a 4-year-old separatist war by Tamil guerrillas. The front says the accord makes too many concessions to the minority Tamils and has vowed to kill anyone who supports the pact. Military officials said last winter that front had about 4,000 supporters in the 45,000-man army. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> mediated the peace accord last summer and it now has 45,000 peackeeping troops in the island. Tamils, who are mostly Hindus and comprise 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people, want a separate homeland, claiming they are discriminated against by the majority <PERSON> Sinhalese </PERSON> <PERSON> Buddhists </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 Experts have started conducting tests to determine how to repair the Sphinx, the ancient monument that lost a chunk of stone from its right shoulder. The limestone slab fell from the Sphinx Feb. 7, six days after a sandstorm buffeted <LOCATION> Giza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plateau </LOCATION>. Damage to the Sphinx caused heated political and scientific debate over the future of the 4,600-year-old monument and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s other ancient treasures The main casualty of the unrest was <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadry </PERSON>, until early February chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Egyptian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Antiquities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kadry </PERSON> lost his job after accusing his boss, Culture Minister <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON> <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON>, of staging the rock fall to reflect badly on <PERSON> Kadry </PERSON>'s stewardship of the Sphinx and, by extension, the other relics of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s rich past Restoration work began on the Sphinx on Monday. The monument was fitted with sandbags for support and scaffolding to help in the early stages of the effort. A committee of experts took rock samples to test for salt content and damage and to see whether the stone is strong enough to hold iron bars that will be inserted to strengthen it. Tests also are being conducted to determine what kind of mortar should be used to cement the rock in place. `` We're not in a hurry. We want to do things right,'' said <PERSON> Zahi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawass </PERSON>, general director of the pyramids area and director of the restoration. The Sphinx has the head of a pharaoh and the body of a crouching lion. Many Egyptologists think the face belonged to <PERSON> Chephren </PERSON>, son of <LOCATION> Cheops </LOCATION> and builder of the second pyramid on <LOCATION> Giza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plateau </LOCATION> next to <LOCATION> Cheops </LOCATION>' Great Pyramid. Any damage to the pyramids or the Sphinx _ symbols of the past with deep emotional overtones for modern Egyptians _ brings instant outcries in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>'s national press. The rock fall proved no exception, to <PERSON> Kadry </PERSON>'s chagrin, and charges of incompetence and corruption flooded the newspapers.

 <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> today repatriated what it believes are the remains of 17 American servicemen listed as missing in action from the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military official said. The Vietnamese also turned over written reports on three other missing Americans, said Lt. Col. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Mather </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military team that flew to <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> to receive the remains. The remains were flown to the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Identification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> for analysis after a brief turnover ceremony at <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Noi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. The repatriation was the fourth largest since the war ended in April 1975 with a communist victory over the U.S.-backed South <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> government. The largest was in August 1985, involving 26 sets of remains. Earlier reports that 20 remains were to be returned today resulted from a misunderstanding in communications from <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Mather </PERSON>, the head of the <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> office of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Joint Casualty Resolution Center. The center, based in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, is entrusted with resolving the fates of nearly 1,800 Americans listed as missing in action, or MIA. <PERSON> Mather </PERSON> said some of the 17 remains and three cases on which written reports were received were on a list of 70 high priority cases that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidential envoy and retired Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> gave the Vietnamese during his mission to <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> last August. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says that in these so-called `` discrepancy cases,'' there is strong evidence the Vietnamese know what happened to the missing men, including photographs of them taken after their capture. <PERSON> Mather </PERSON> said each set of remains was accompanied by a written report containing such information as the area where the remains were found, and what people there said about them. He said the Vietnamese also turned over identification cards and `` dog tags'' _ military identification tags which servicemen wear around their necks. <PERSON> Mather </PERSON> said the remains were placed in metal transfer cases and loaded onto a C-141 transport plane for the flight to <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> honor guard saluted as each case, draped with a folded <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag, was loaded during the half-hour ceremony, he said. A high proportion of remains returned by <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> after a preliminary analysis are later confirmed by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> laboratory as those of MIAs. <PERSON> Mather </PERSON> also announced that the Vietnamese have set March 12 as the starting date for the next round of `` technical talks'' on MIAs. During these talks, which <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> has agreed to hold six times annually, experts on both sides discuss ways of retrieving remains, locating warplane crash sites and related issues. Today's turnover was the third since <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> agreed during <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON>'s visit to break a long deadlock and resume efforts to account for the missing men. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> pledged then to look into <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s own humanitarian concerns, and an official <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> medical team flew into <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> today to continue that mission, said the spokesman of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Petzing </PERSON>. It was the fourth visit by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> medical team. The teams have been studying the plight of disabled war veterans and other humanitarian cases and made recommendations on how private <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> charitable organizations can aid rehabilitation programs. <PERSON> Petzing </PERSON> said the team included Dr. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dam </PERSON>, an orthopedic surgeon at the <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Downs </PERSON>, the director of the Prosthetics and <ORGANIZATION> Sensory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aids </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>; and <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerr </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s desk officer for <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. The Vietnamese have said they prefer direct <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government aid, but <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has refused because of its embargo on aid to protest <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>.

 A millionaire stock trader charged with intending to shoot financier <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> has been ordered held without bail by a judge who rejected arguments that jail would harm the trader's mental health. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulheren </PERSON>, 38, of <LOCATION> Rumson </LOCATION> appeared Tuesday before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Manna </PERSON> to face two charges of attempting to tamper with a federal witness. He was transferred to a federal prison in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The magistrate scheduled a Friday bail hearing over the objections of <PERSON> Mulheren </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, who said his client suffered manic-depression. `` A manic-depressive such as my client back on lithium for the last five days is not a risk to himself or others,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> told the judge. `` Jail is detrimental to his condition. He's far better off in a private care clinic.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mulheren </PERSON> was on a `` manic-crash'' the day authorities allege he intended to shoot <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>. Authorities contend <PERSON> Mulheren </PERSON> pulled out of his riverfront estate Feb. 18 with a high-powered assault rifle and <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> fatigues in the back seat of his car after police had confiscated three other weapons from him. He intended to shoot <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, 50, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s former chief stock trader, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidoff </PERSON>, 43, of <LOCATION> Manalapan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION>, according to a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> complaint. Before the federal hearing Tuesday, state <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Y. </PERSON> <PERSON> Milberg </PERSON> released <PERSON> Mulheren </PERSON> from the county jail where he was being held on the state charges. <PERSON> Mulheren </PERSON> was arrested immediately afterward by four <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshals, flanked by an investigator from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office in the southern district of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and a federal attorney from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, authorities said <PERSON> Mulheren </PERSON> had been held in the county jail in lieu of $ 17,500 bail on two weapons charges that carry a total maximum of 15 years in prison. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> told the magistrate that <PERSON> Mulheren </PERSON> was not bailed out of the county jail for 12 days because his manic-depressive condition precluded him from cooperating with attorneys on a defense. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> asked that bail be set at Tuesday's hearing. However, <PERSON> Manna </PERSON> ruled in favor of <PERSON> Terrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>, an assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney who said he needed more time to prepare his case. <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, once a close friend of <PERSON> Mulheren </PERSON>'s, and <PERSON> Davidoff </PERSON> pleaded guilty last year to a single count of securities fraud and have cooperated with the government's continuing investigation of insider trading on Wall Street. <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> paid a fine of $ 100 million to the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to settle civil charges of insider trading, and will begin serving a three-year prison term March 24. <PERSON> Davidoff </PERSON> faces a five-year term when sentenced. <PERSON> Mulheren </PERSON> is a friend of rock star <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Springsteen </PERSON>. The singer, also of <LOCATION> Rumson </LOCATION>, visited <PERSON> Mulheren </PERSON> in the county jail Saturday during a break in his national concert tour, <LOCATION> Monmouth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lanzaro </PERSON> confirmed Monday.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and 15 other allied leaders today began their first summit talks since 1982 in a bid to underscore the unity of the Western alliance despite differences over nuclear arms strategy. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, the last of the leaders to arrive at sprawling <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> headquarters, made no comment as he passed a crowd of reporters and diplomats for the first summit session, but <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON> stressed the cohesion of the alliance. <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON> said the summit will provide <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> `` with sustained impetus ... in a way which will reflect the fundamental solidarity which unites us in trans-Atlantic partnership.'' Looking toward Soviet-American arms talks, <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON> said an improved Soviet human rights record was fundamental to creating `` the confidence necessary to proceed with a radical arms control agenda.'' He added: `` For most of us in the West that cause -LRB- of tension -RRB- is the degree of mistrust created by the denial of basic human rights and freedom to the peoples of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON> reaffirmed <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s commitment supporting a proposed superpower agreement to reduce long-range nuclear weaponry by 50 percent on both sides. He said <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> also looked forward to `` a more serious engagement'' with the Soviet-led <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> on a chemical weapons ban and reducing the Eastern bloc's superiority in conventional arms. Central to the summit talks here was the issue of how to fill the gap left by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s agreeement with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> last December to eliminate ground-launched medium-range nuclear missiles from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. While the allies agreed on the need to reduce East-West conventional forces, a dispute remained over whether <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> members should quickly improve their stocks of short-range nuclear missiles. `` I do n't look for any glossing over at all,'' said Canadian Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> as he arrived for the talks. As the meeting began, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> reported that `` progress is fine'' on drafting a statement of common alliance goals to be issued at the conclusion of the two-day summit. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who reached <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> coughing and complaining of allergies, ws to spend 2 1-2 hours conferring with the 15 other heads of state or government. When he arrived Tuesday, the president tried to allay concerns over the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION>'s advantage in conventional forces by promising to keep <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> `` as long as Europeans want them to stay.'' Before the summit talks began over lunch, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> met privately with Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> on the secretary's recent efforts to get the peace process moving in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters that <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> has been doing `` yeoman's work'' and that <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has made clear it wants a more visible role in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace process Although <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said no decision had been made, he and other officials indicated <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is likely to send <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> back to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> after the summit. In his afternoon remarks to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> _ a session closed to reporters in the alliance's austere central meeting hall _ the president was to repeat his assurances of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commitment to the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> democracies and urge them to repel Soviet attempts to split the pact. The heads of state and government will discuss `` overall policy and the direction of the alliance _ the big picture,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also planned to listen to his colleagues' concerns, particularly about the new round of arms control talks and their worries that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> budget restrictions might force cutbacks in the 326,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops stationed in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> `` We also expect them to voice support ... as the president prepares for the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. A date has n't been set, but the fourth meeting between <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is expected to be held in late May or June The spokesman said that while the nuts and bolts on issues such as troop strength would be left to lower-level aides, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would urge the members to push forward on talks with the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc on reducing its edge in conventional forces. Now in a preliminary stage in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, the discussions over conventional force reductions are expected to begin in earnest this fall. Planners on both sides of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> have predicted that no major decisions will result from the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit. The leaders are expected to sidestep differences over such issues as modernizing their own short-range nuclear weapons arsenal, and concentrate instead on issuing final statements that emphasize the pact's cohesion and resolve

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Caine </PERSON> has just made his eighth film in three years and has a TV miniseries set to roll, but the Oscar-winning star of `` Sherlock and Me'' says he still worries about being out of work. `` You feel uneasy if you have n't got something to do,'' <PERSON> Caine </PERSON> said in an interview in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, where the $ 8.5 million-movie was concluding its nine-week shoot. `` People say I work all the time, but I do n't. What they -LRB- distributors -RRB- do is always put the bloody things out at the same time.'' The actor's on-screen good cheer has been one of the few constants in the ever-changing Hollywood scene. Last year, he played <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Field </PERSON>'s love interest in `` Surrender'' and a British intelligence agent in `` The Fourth Protocol.'' He starred in films as quintessentially <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> as `` Jaws IV _ The Revenge,'' and as quintessentially English as `` The Whistle Blower,'' a political thriller. In 1986 he was a British diplomat romantically linked with call girl <PERSON> Sigourney </PERSON> <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON> in `` Half Moon Street,'' and had vivid supporting roles in `` Sweet Liberty'' and `` <PERSON> Mona </PERSON> <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>.'' Then, too, there was his Academy Award last year for best supporting actor for his performance in `` <PERSON> Hannah </PERSON> and Her Sisters.'' The erstwhile <PERSON> Cockney </PERSON>, who was born <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Micklewhite </PERSON> in 1933, the son of a porter at <LOCATION> Billingsgate </LOCATION> fish market in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, had integrated himself into the bittersweet world of <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> neurotics `` I'd known <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> for years, and I knew <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> so well,'' said <PERSON> Caine </PERSON>. `` I do n't have a voice which is posh British, anyway. `` My attitude is that I'm more like an American, coming from a working-class background. Lots of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> think I'm Australian, or something like that _ <ORGANIZATION> Crocodile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dundee </ORGANIZATION>'s father.'' <PERSON> Caine </PERSON>'s previous Oscar nominations were for `` Alfie'' in 1966, `` Sleuth'' in 1972 and `` Educating Rita'' in 1983. In his new film, he impersonates that celebrated sleuth, <PERSON> Sherlock </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>. <PERSON> Caine </PERSON> is a boozing, down-on-his-luck actor who is hired by Dr. <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> to play the famed fictional detective to prove him real. `` I get to play two parts and a particular hero of mine, which I like, because I've always been a great fan of <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>,'' he said. `` We have the pipe, the magnifying glass, everything,'' said <PERSON> Caine </PERSON>, referring to the traditional <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> accoutrements. `` It's a chance to play a hero who I'm not really right for and to do it in an entirely different way, as a comedy.'' The film, due out in the fall from <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>, co-stars Oscar winner <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Kingsley </PERSON> -LRB- `` Gandhi'' -RRB- as Dr. <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, who is forced by public demand to find a real-life <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> to match the figure he has been writing about in a magazine. <PERSON> Caine </PERSON> compared his creation to the part of the inimitable Inspector Clouseau,, created by the late <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sellers </PERSON> in the popular Pink Panther series. `` <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> would have laughed at some of the physical humor I do. The character is such a putz,'' <PERSON> Caine </PERSON> said. `` I'm having fun; I'll tell you that.'' On March 14, <PERSON> Caine </PERSON> moves on to his next assignment: a CBS miniseries, `` Jack the Ripper,'' which marks his first TV work since he played <PERSON> Horatio </PERSON> to <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Plummer </PERSON>'s Hamlet in a 1966 production of <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s tragedy. <PERSON> Caine </PERSON> will play the fictitious Inspector <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Abberline </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard in the $ 5 million show. Said to be based on confidential police and government files, the show will be aired in the autumn to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the notorious mass murderer, who terrorized Victorian <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in the late 1880s. <PERSON> Caine </PERSON> said he's made a conscious effort to vary his parts and his performances. `` It gives you cachet as someone who can play anything,'' he said. `` I've been a leading actor, not a movie star who comes on and does the <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Caine </PERSON> personality performance like a <PERSON> Cary </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> or a <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON>, although I admire both of them very much.'' His salary, he joked, reflected this attitude: `` I know a lot of actors like <PERSON> Dustin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON>, who do n't do pictures for years, but they get $ 6 million, $ 7 million, $ 15 million a picture.'' `` I do n't. I get $ 1.98 and a bollocking -LRB- a reprimand -RRB- for being late on Monday morning,'' he joked. <PERSON> Caine </PERSON> is one of the few British actors who reportedly commands around $ 1 million a movie. <PERSON> Caine </PERSON> said the British had reacted oddly to his decision in June 1986 to return to his native country with his wife, the Indian model <PERSON> Shakira </PERSON> <PERSON> Baksh </PERSON>, and their 14-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Natasha </PERSON>, after living for nine years in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` People here treat me as if I'd just come back from some fearsome jungle and survived,'' he said. `` Americans are just like we are, except they work harder _ that's what frightens the British. You've got to get up at 8 o'clock Monday morning and go out and do something; you ca n't just sit there.'' <PERSON> Caine </PERSON> is glad to be home. He divides his time between an apartment in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s elegant <LOCATION> Knightsbridge </LOCATION> and a 15th-century manor house in rural <LOCATION> Oxfordshire </LOCATION> northwest of the capital city. As for the sometimes brutal English class system, <PERSON> Caine </PERSON> said it's no problem. `` Years ago, all the people who would n't have spoken to me are now people I would n't want to speak to because they're so boring,'' he said. `` I've gone beyond class. I go with anybody, from the queen down.''

<HEAD>Government Attorney Charges Pilot Drug Abuse In Delta Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The pilot of the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> airliner that crashed at <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in 1985, killing 137 people, had a pattern of `` use and abuse'' of three tranquilizers, a government lawyer said. Attorney <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Krieger </PERSON> suggested during his opening statement at a trial to determine liability for the crash that <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Connors </PERSON> might have habitually piloted jetliners under the influence of drugs. <PERSON> Krieger </PERSON> told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Belew </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who is presiding over the non-jury trial, that prescription records will show <PERSON> Connors </PERSON> took the tranquilizers Dalmane in 1978, Valium in 1982 and 1984 and Stelazine from 1982 to 1985. The records will show `` a clear pattern of use and abuse of these tranquilizers'' over the eight years before the Aug. 2, 1985, crash, <PERSON> Krieger </PERSON> said. `` The conclusion is inescapable,'' <PERSON> Krieger </PERSON> said. `` He must have been taking them on the days he was flying'' because the prescription quantities were too large to have been taken only when he was off duty. `` Why should the day of the crash be any different than all the other days in the previous years that he was taking tranquilizers,'' <PERSON> Krieger </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> lawyer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said during a break in the trial that there is no evidence that <PERSON> Connors </PERSON> was using Stelazine at the time of the crash. He said too little tissue was recovered from the crash to run tests for drugs other than alcohol. Those tests were negative. `` The medical experts will show -LRB- Stelazine -RRB- is a prescription tranquilizer that would not affect a person's ability to fly anyway,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. `` There are pilots who fly taking Stelazine.'' During his opening statement, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said negligence on the part of <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> employees caused <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> Flight 191 to crash. `` The crew of 191 found themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time'' because none of the government employees did their jobs,'' he said. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> claimed <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> controllers and the weather service failed to warn the flight crew of the severity of weather at the airport. A report by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> concluded that the crash was caused, in part, by the pilot's decision to fly the L-1011 widebody jet into a wind shear, a violent downdraft. The trial will determine whether the government must pay part of $ 91.2 million in claims that <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>'s insurers have paid so far in the crash. In December, <PERSON> Belew </PERSON> ruled that about 90 lawsuits filed by individuals against <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> should be parceled out from federal court in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> to other federal courts. About half of those suits have been settled.

He was a darling of a man, very congenial.'' <PERSON> Besser </PERSON> joined <PERSON> Moe </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Fine </PERSON> from 1956 to 1958 and was one of several actors to replace <PERSON> Shemp </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> as the third stooge. The Three Stooges specialized in head-knocking, eye-gouging slapstick, pratfalls and endless buffoonery. The trio made more than 190 short films and about 50 feature-length films until the'60s, <PERSON> Lenburg </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Besser </PERSON> embraced his role, bouncing off his fellow stooges in a schtick that distinguised his character. No matter how light the slap, <PERSON> Besser </PERSON>'s invariable response was a whining, `` Not so h-a-a-a-a-a-r-d.'' The stooges' preposterousness elicited from <PERSON> Besser </PERSON> an exasperated, `` Ooooh, you crazy. The original Three Stooges, created in the vaudeville days of the 1920s, were <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> `` Moe'' <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON>, who changed his last name to <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>; his brother <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> `` Shemp'' <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Fineberg </PERSON>, who used the stage name Fine. By the early 1930s, <PERSON> Shemp </PERSON> had left in a pay dispute and was replaced by his brother, <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, known as Curly. Curly left the team in 1946 after suffering a stroke, and brother <PERSON> Shemp </PERSON> came back to replace him. After <PERSON> Shemp </PERSON>'s death in 1955, he was replaced by <PERSON> Besser </PERSON>, who in turn was replaced in 1959 by <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Rita </PERSON>, who played `` Curly <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>,'' when the trio began making feature films. Curly <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> died in 1952. <PERSON> Moe </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> and Fine died in 1975. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Rita </PERSON>, the last surviving stooge, is 79 and retired, <PERSON> Lenburg </PERSON> said. The character of <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> became <PERSON> Besser </PERSON>'s trademark and he added to it in television's `` The <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON> and Costello Show,'' where he played the mean, whining brat `` Stinky'' who liked to slap <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> around. He appeared on `` The <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON> and Costello Show'' in the 1950s and'60s, along with regular appearances on `` The <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> Show'' and `` The Joey Bishop Show.'' <PERSON> Besser </PERSON> made 250 television appearances during his 67-year career, joking with such comics as <PERSON> Berle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>. He also appeared in more than 40 films. Before becoming a Stooge, <PERSON> Besser </PERSON> worked as a comedian on Broadway, on radio and in motion pictures. In the 1940s, his portrayal of an exasperated, whining child earned him a spot in <LOCATION> Olsen </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s long-running Broadway show, `` Sons o' Fun,'' a sequel to their `` Hellzapoppin.'' <PERSON> Besser </PERSON> called his association with the Stooges `` the happiest years of my life in show business.'' He was on hand in 1983 when The Three Stooges were awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. <PERSON> Besser </PERSON> is survived by his wife of 56 years, <PERSON> Ernie </PERSON>. Funeral arrangements were pending.

<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> said a chain of bombs found at the end of an airport runway were planted by leftist extremists who planned to assassinate him by destroying his plane. Authorities disclosed late Monday that they had discovered six homemade bombs loaded with plastic explosives and shrapnel at the city airport of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Serena </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> coast 300 miles north of <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>. Attached to each bomb were about 300 sticks of dynamite, according to a communique issued by the Civil Aviation office. The bombs were buried at the western end of the runway and connected to a 2,000-foot-long detonating cable that ran to a ravine beside the airport. The explosives were discovered on Saturday, the communique said. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> was to fly to <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Serena </LOCATION> on Jan. 29 to appear at an agricultural fair, but canceled the visit at the last minute. On Tuesday, during a tour of southern <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, he told reporters there was evidence the bombs were planted in anticipation of his visit. `` They knew I was going to the north and prepared the explosive material that was found,'' he said during a stop in the town of <LOCATION> Maullin </LOCATION>, 700 miles south of the capital. His remarks were carried by <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> radio stations. He said it was only by chance that he did not travel to <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Serena </PERSON>. `` There were a series of problems that obliged me to stay in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>,'' he said. In September 1986, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> survived an ambush of his motorcade by a commando of the pro-communist <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Front </PERSON>, the country's main lefitst guerrilla organization. Five of his bodyguards were kiilled in the attack with machine-gun and rocket fire. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, commander of the army, seized power in a 1973 coup that toppled the elected government of Marxist President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 A Molotov cocktail was dropped off a bridge today onto one tugboat and flares were fired at another in violence stemming from a 2-week-old longshoreman's strike, police said. The incendiary device bounced harmlessly off the tugboat, which was towing a gasoline barge, and fell into the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> at 4 a.m., said Sgt. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON>. About 5:30 a.m., several flares from a flare gun were fired from a pier at a tugboat towing two city Sanitation Department barges, but missed all three vessels, <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON> said. The flares were fired from a pier at <LOCATION> Newtown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, which empties into the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and divides the boroughs of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>. Late Monday, a Molotov cocktail was tossed from the Queensboro Bridge onto a barge unloading 500,000 gallons of gasoline at the <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Storage </ORGANIZATION> facility. It ignited a small fire that was extinguished quickly and caused only minor damage. Police have recorded more than a dozen violent incidents since the strike began Feb. 16, including the wounding a week ago of a tugboat captain when shots fired at his boat shattered the glass in the pilot house. Negotiations between Local 333 of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Longshoremen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and five of the nine tugboat companies being struck are to resume Thursday for the first time since the strike began. At issue are concessions the tugboat companies are demanding from the approximately 2,500 affected tugboat and barge workers. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Cornette </PERSON>, Local 333 president, said earlier that union members unanimously rejected the companies' demands for the elimination of 750 jobs and for wage and benefit givebacks of up to 62 percent. Five companies had locked the workers out and four had not come to terms, <PERSON> Cornette </PERSON> said. Those firms have been using replacement workers, he said. The union has signed with nine other companies and 10 more had unexpired contracts.

 <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON> and her former husband will reportedly receive up to $ 40,000 in a settlement with the agency that brokered her contract to act as a surrogate mother in the Baby M case.

The lawyer for Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehead-Gould </PERSON>, <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegal </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, did not return a telephone call Tuesday.

<TEXT>
 Foreign Minister <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> today urged <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> to allow <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, leader of the outlawed Solidarity labor federation, to visit <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. He said he cabled <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, urging him to approve <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s application to travel to <LOCATION> Melbourne </LOCATION> to attend a four-day <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Confederation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unions </ORGANIZATION> starting March 14. The Polish government said Tuesday it would bar <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and three aides from attending the congress, citing the protection of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s `` basic political interests.'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and the three other Solidarity leaders have been trying to obtain passports to allow them to attend the congress. They were invited by the <ORGANIZATION> Australian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unions </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON>, the government spokesman in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, said the Solidarity delegation would be prevented from going to the congress as representatives of `` a Polish trade union which was dissolved and ceased to exist legally.'' `` <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s and his colleagues' trip and their participation in the Australian congress would be contradictory to the basic political interests -LRB- of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> -RRB- and would be a mockery of our legal order,'' Urban told reporters. `` Polish law regulating passport affairs orders denials of passports in such cases. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> has the sovereign right to protect its legal order.'' Urban criticized some Australian trade union activists for threatening to cut off water and electricity to the Polish consulate in <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION> and the Polish Embassy in <LOCATION> Canberra </LOCATION> if <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and his aides are refused passports, saying that such threats are only `` inflaming the atmosphere.'' He said <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> would not yield to the `` pressure of hooligan threats'' toward its diplomatic missions, adding that it was <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s duty `` to guarantee the functioning of Polish consular offices.'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> has not traveled abroad since the December 1981 imposition of martial law that crushed Solidarity. Also invited to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> were Wroclaw Solidarity leader <PERSON> Wladyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Frasyniuk </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Bogdan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lis </PERSON> and senior adviser <PERSON> Bronislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON>. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, contacted Tuesday at his <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> apartment, expressed surprise and disappointment. `` Now I can see that as long as Urban and company are in power I have no chance. Please let me know as soon as you hear about Urban's end,'' said <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, the 1983 Nobel Peace prize winner. `` I have no further comment,'' he said. `` We have to wait for the reaction of trade unions and other organizations.'' In <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, trade unionists reacted angrily to Urban's comments `` We have a moral duty to protest against the Polish authorities' actions and to back up our verbal condemnation with a bit of action,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Easson </PERSON>, assistant secretary of the Trades and <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>. `` We reject the accusation by Polish authorities that Australian unions were behaving like hooligans for insisting that Mr. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> by granted permission to visit <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>,'' he added. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Weyman </PERSON>, ethnic affairs director for the Federated Iron Workers, told his members to boycott Polish ships and cut off water, gas and electricity supplies to the consul in <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION> and the embassy in <LOCATION> Canberra </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Communist Party Acknowledges Anti-Semitic Excesses Of 1968</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Authorities today acknowledged `` manifestations of anti-Semitism'' in a 1968 purge of intellectuals and liberals that forced thousands of Jews out of the Communist party, government and academia. An article in the Communist party daily <PERSON> Trybuna </PERSON> <PERSON> Ludu </PERSON> said innocent people were harmed merely for advocating reform, but it added that `` the predominant majority of party and state activists had no part in anti-Semitism.'' Addressing the 20th anniversary of the March 1968 event, the 1 -LCB- - page article said some conservative, nationalist party factions `` took advantage of the Jewish ancestry'' of some of their political rivals `` Injustice was done to many people of Jewish descent as they were removed from political and professional positions, irrespective of their views and conduct,'' the paper said. But, it added, all the people in the conservative faction in the intra-party struggle were not anti-Semitic, and some actively disassociated themselves from anti-Semitism. About 9,000 Jews lost positions in the party, government, academia and other official institutions in the purge. An estimated 12,000 to 20,000 Jews emigrated, the majority of the Jewish population that remained after the Nazi Holocaust. The first word that the party was going to issue a revised history of the 1968 `` anti-Zionist'' purges came at the end of January in a speech by a Polish historian in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Two weeks ago, the party weekly Polityka printed a chronology of the events with a critical introduction. But the <ORGANIZATION> Trybuna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ludu </ORGANIZATION> article, which was reported by the state-run news agency <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> and television, has the authority of an official party statement. Speaking more generally about the persecution of liberals at the time, the party paper said, `` Identification of the pro-reformatory movement with revisionist and anti-socialist movements was a mistake on the part of the leadership.'' It said the party leadership failed to make contact with the leading intellectuals who made `` rational proposals of democratization and who sought a dialogue with the authorities'' while recognizing the authority of the party. Discrimination against Jews, in the guise `` anti-Zionism,'' began after <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s victory in the June 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. But it accelerated sharply in 1968. Before World War II, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> was home to more than 3.5 million Jews _ more than half the world's Jewry. There are now believed to be between 7,000 and 15,000 Jews, with not a rabbi among them. `` All the obscenities of the March -LRB- 1968 -RRB- propaganda campaign have been repeated, all of them,'' said <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Michnik </PERSON>, a prominent opposition activist and historian who was a student leader in 1968 and a chief target of anti-Semitic attacks. `` What has been done is nothing but cosmetics,'' he said in a telephone interview. A leading party theoretician and journalist, <PERSON> Ludwik </PERSON> <PERSON> Krasucki </PERSON>, said on Polish television Tuesday that the party's attempts to reconsider the history of the period were vital. He expressed hope that with a thorough re-examination of the period, in all its aspects, `` this chapter, which nevertheless ca n't be forgotten, shall once and for all be closed.''

 Less than a week ago, <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> was reviled in much of the hemisphere as a figurehead president of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, a tool of the country's military establishment, a man who gave <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s political system a constitutional facade. But, in a single stroke, <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> has carried out a remarkable political rehabilitation. He has been transformed from <LOCATION> Delvalle </LOCATION> the Meek to <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> the Martyr. Much of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's strategy toward <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> over the past few days has been built around <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> and his claim to be <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s constitutional president. He is an integral part of the administration's `` chipmunk strategy'' toward <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> _ keep gnawing away at <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s economy, at military strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s claim to legitimacy and his reputation and base of support at home and abroad. In time, the administration hopes, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> will wake up, find his hold on power has evaporated and depart his homeland quietly. The administration wanted a democratic symbol around whom Panamanians could rally, and found one in <LOCATION> Delvalle </LOCATION>, the man who defied <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the armed forces chieftain, political heavyweight and, according to a federal indictment, cocaine smuggler. For now, at least, <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> has the earmarks of a Panamanian version of <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, a democratic symbol around whom opposition to <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> coalesced. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s image as a powerless front man dates back to when he took office in the fall of 1985. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was unhappy with the president at the time, <PERSON> Nicolas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ardito </PERSON> <PERSON> Barletta </PERSON>, because of an independent streak, and he forced <PERSON> Barletta </PERSON> from office. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> was sworn in as president under the most unpromising of circumstances. In effect, he had to behave according to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s wishes or he would end up like <PERSON> Barletta </PERSON> He carried that burden for two years. The image he projects nowadays is quite different. A certain mystique has developed around <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> since he tried to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and wound up out of office himself. Rather than flee the country after his dismissal, he has gone into hiding, issuing proclamations to his countrymen, making videotaped messages and frustrating efforts by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s forces to locate him. One of his chief allies these days is <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, a former ambassador to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> who is now a captain of the anti-Noriega campaign in exile. To hear <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> tell it, <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> had wanted to break with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> for five months but was reluctant to do so because of `` confusing'' signals from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said Tuesday that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has been suspicious of <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s intentions for some time and kept telling the president, `` Do n't act against me because the gringos are behind me.'' This was based on what <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> felt were reassuring visits by emissaries from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, including <ORGANIZATION> Assistant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Armitage </PERSON>. One turning point occurred in early January, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said, when a gathering of Panamanian opposition leaders met in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> sent an envoy. `` The emissary told us that if we gave him -LRB- <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> -RRB- assurances that we would support him, he was ready to act and dismiss <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. `` We sent him back a message,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. `` We have heard that many times. We want deeds and not words. If you fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and his cronies, we will give you support.'' Contacts with <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> and other <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> opponents continued, with some messages being passed by <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s dentist in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Another turning point took place in early February when two <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> grand juries charged that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was a key figure in an international drug smuggling ring. With an end to the ambiguity in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s position, the opposition front suggested that <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> come here to announce his break with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> before the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> agreed and arrangements were made. But then <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> had second thoughts, reasoning that firing <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> might be seen `` as acting on instructions from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. But was <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> getting cold feet? At <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>' instigation, Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., called <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> to give him encouragement On Feb. 17, <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and invited Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> to visit him. If <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> was ousted for trying to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> assured him, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would support him as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s constitutional president, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said Eight days later, in an important moment in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s tumultuous history, <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> fired <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> only to be dismissed himself hours later by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s allies in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said the turn of events was foreseen in an 18-point anti-Noriega conspiracy crafted by the opposition coalition. He said the program is up to point six. Twelve to go.

<TEXT>
 Police have been guarding the offices of a conservative weekly newspaper that has revived stinging attacks on a black professor and reawakened charges of racism at <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. A march through the school's Fraternity Row and continued picketing of several businesses that advertise in The <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> were planned today, and a larger rally was scheduled for Thursday. Four Review staff members face college disciplinary charges and possible expulsion stemming from a confrontation last week with <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, a music professor who once sued the paper for libel. The staffers say they are being persecuted for taking strong stands on the quality of <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> life and education, and deny that race has anything to do with it. The independent newspaper also was at the center of controversy two years ago when 12 students, mostly Review staffers, took sledgehammers to symbolic anti-apartheid shanties on the campus green. That raid sparked a semester of sit-ins, disciplinary hearings and other unrest that caused a leadership crisis for <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>. <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> resigned in June 1987, though he said the disturbances did n't contribute directly to his decision. As tensions rise again, <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>'s successor, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON>, said Tuesday he would `` urge everyone in the <LOCATION> Dartmouth </LOCATION> community to take the high road to civility of expression.'' <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON> had a similar message Monday when he spoke to 250 students at a rally protesting the Review's attacks on Cole. He defended <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>'s qualifications, as well as the right to freedom of speech, `` however unpopular, provocative and offensive that speech may sometimes be.'' Cole sued the paper in 1983 for libel over an article that said he `` looks like a used Brillo pad.'' He dropped the suit in 1985. He received no damages and both sides claimed vindication. Two weeks ago the Review published a cover story calling <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>'s teaching performance `` academically deficient'' and including excerpts from a transcript from one of his recent classes On Thursday four Review staffers approached Cole after a class. Editor-in-chief <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON> said the staffers wanted to give Cole a chance to rebut their article, and to demand that he apologize for allegedly calling them `` white-boy racists'' during a class. Shouting ensued, and the incident ended with the professor allegedly breaking the camera flash of Review photographer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Quilhot </PERSON>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said today that many aspects of Soviet President <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>'s memoirs dealing with Chinese-Soviet relations are false. `` Many of the recollections and descriptions in <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>'s memoirs relating to the history and present state of Chinese-Soviet relations do not square with the facts,'' ministry spokeswoman <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Jinghua </PERSON> told a weekly news briefing She refused to elaborate on what elements in the memoirs <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> disputed. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, quoting an advance copy of <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>'s two-volume book `` Memoir,'' said <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> claimed <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON> proposed in 1958 that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> help lure <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops into <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and attack them there with nuclear weapons <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> wrote that <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> was expecting a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attack on mainland <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> because of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s support for the Nationalist Chinese government on <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and tensions over the tiny islands of <LOCATION> Quemoy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Matsu </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> said in `` Memoir'' that he rejected the plan, proposed while he was on a secret August 1958 visit to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, according to the Times. Ms. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> confirmed that <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>, then Soviet foreign minister, visited <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1958.

 A former congressman who has accused <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential contender <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> of ducking combat duty in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> said today the candidate is `` chickening out'' by trying to drop his libel suit. `` He's chickening out of the trial just like he chickened out 37 years ago,'' said former Rep. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, R-Calif. `` The courtroom's a great place to learn the truth ... Now that he's up with the truth to be told and testimony under oath, he's backing off.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who faced a trial date on Super Tuesday _ the day 20 states hold primaries and caucuses, said Tuesday he wants to drop his $ 35 million libel suit against <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON>. `` In order to compete in that trial, I would have to break off my campaign today and run the risk of losing <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and other parts of the South,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> `` That was an impossible decision for me to make and an unfair one,'' he added. But <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON>, who insists <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> invoked his late father's political influence to avoid combat in the Korean War, said he will oppose the former television evangelist's request to drop the case `` I think the truth ought to be told,'' <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON> said on `` CBS This Morning.'' `` I do n't know any better place to get the truth than in the courtroom. He invoked the process, he ought to go through with it.'' <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON> said he fears that an individual who avoided combat in his youth may try to make amends in the White House. `` You know when you get a president in office who has evaded combat in his youth and all his advisers are saying look tough against the Soviets ... I think there is a tendency to try to prove your manhood late in life,'' <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s lawyers called a news conference at their <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> offices today to discuss their decision to ask <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Hens </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> to dismiss the lawsuit. `` She ca n't force a plaintiff to continue the suit,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said. But under the civil rules of procedure, the judge could force <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> to go to trial unless he pays <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON>'s legal expenses of nearly $ 400,000. `` We are prepared to go to trial,'' said <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehner </PERSON>, adding that the former congressman has long insisted that <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> pay his legal fees as a condition for any settlement. The case involves a 1986 letter that <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON> wrote to Rep. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ind </LOCATION>., alleging that <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> used the political influence of his father, the late Sen. <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, D-Va., to get out of combat duty in the Korean <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON>, a decorated Marine, was aboard a troop ship from which <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> was removed during a stop in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> before the ship proceeded to <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. He quoted <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> as telling fellow Marines that his father had helped him get out of combat. In the letter that was published by two syndicated newspaper columns, <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON> also said the former television evangelist was later assigned to be a `` booze officer'' to a rear-echelon unit in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> called <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON> `` a patent liar.'' But <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON>, a liberal Republican who once sought the Republican presidential nomination as an opponent of President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s Vietnam War policies, has found a number of ex-Marines who served in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> who support his story. The former congressman also said today that <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, in letters written during the war, thanked the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> for assuring that his son would not be involved in combat. <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON>'s lawyers subpoenad the letters, which had been left to <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> A trial, as scheduled, would have resulted in extensive publicity about the allegations as <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> is trying to win votes in the presidential race. As early as last fall, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> expressed regrets over filing the politically troublesome lawsuit, telling Time magazine: `` In all candor, I think it was a bad idea.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who had earlier called Judge <PERSON> Green </PERSON> `` patently unfair'' for refusing to postpone the trial, said Tuesday that she `` had done everything she can to get us to drop the case.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> proposed that he and <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON> submit their case to the <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Libel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dispute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> run by the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION>'s law school and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arbitration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. If <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON> refuses, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> says he will seek to drop the lawsuit anyway and put the facts of the case to an unspecified panel of experts. `` We will prove to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people that he truly does n't want the truth to come out,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Lehner </PERSON> called the proposal for arbitration `` a red herring,'' and noted that the idea had been rejected by <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s own lawyers nine months ago.

<HEAD>Mother Pleads Guilty to Reduced Charges In Deaths Of Two Children</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A 19-year-old woman could be sentenced to up to four years in jail and fined $ 10,000 in the deaths of her two children last summer in a locked, sun-baked car. <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Shields </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION>, pleaded guilty Tuesday to reduced charges in the deaths of <LOCATION> Kristle </LOCATION>, 3, and <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Shields </PERSON>, 1. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> County Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> accepted pleas to two counts of endangering the welfare of children, and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Attorney </LOCATION> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> agreed to drop two counts of involuntary manslaughter. No sentencing date was set. Mrs. <PERSON> Shields </PERSON>' 24-year-old husband, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Shields </PERSON>, goes on trial March 14 on charges of involuntary manslaughter and endangering the welfare of children. Mrs. <PERSON> Shields </PERSON> stopped her trial, which began Monday, and pleaded guilty after her husband testified that he had agreed to care for the children and had locked them in the car while his wife slept. <PERSON> Shields </PERSON> said he hid the car in which the children were sleeping in a sunny area at the rear of a farmhouse after a friend told him a warrant had been issued for his arrest because the car had no license plates and was not registered. He said he closed the car windows `` because it was supposed to rain'' and locked the doors because `` I did n't want anyone taking my kids.'' <PERSON> Shields </PERSON> said he left the children in the car because the house was unheated and had broken windows. Earlier Tuesday, Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenney </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> assistant professor of physiology, said the temperature in the car probably reached 150 degrees, which the children could have withstood for 17 minutes. Both parents have been in jail since their arrests shortly after the children's deaths in August.

<TEXT>
 A lawyer seeking Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s testimony in a drug trial says the ex-National <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide will refuse to answer questions by invoking his constitutional right against self-incrimination <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dresnick </PERSON>, who obtained subpoenas last week against North and two other figures in the Iran-Contra affair, said Tuesday he had not decided whether to pursue his bid to compel <PERSON> North </PERSON> to appear March 15 in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. However, the attorney said he believed North could provide information to support his claim that his client, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Turek </PERSON> <PERSON> Correa </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, was a victim of entrapment or other government misconduct. <PERSON> Dresnick </PERSON> said he wanted to question North about <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, a former airline pilot whom <PERSON> Dresnick </PERSON> claimed was being protected from prosecution. <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> accompanied <PERSON> Correa </PERSON> and other defendants on an airplane that allegedly carried drugs from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, the attorney said. But <PERSON> Dresnick </PERSON> said he believed <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> was allowed to go free because the government wanted to conceal his alternate role in shipping food and clothing to the Contra rebels trying to topple the government of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dresnick </PERSON>, in court papers seeking to subpoena <PERSON> North </PERSON>, said the DC-6 airplane allegedly used to ship the drugs to <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> was once owned by <ORGANIZATION> Vortex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> is a former executive with both Vortex and <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION>, which <PERSON> Dresnick </PERSON> called a CIA-backed operation. `` I believe the government knows about <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> and ... must be aware that <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> was involved in drug smuggling,'' <PERSON> Dresnick </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> also has been subpoenaed to testify in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, but his whereabouts are unknown, <PERSON> Dresnick </PERSON> said. The attorney said he was forced to subpoena <PERSON> North </PERSON> because of the government's refusal to produce <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> acknowledged Tuesday that <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> was not included in a Sept. 24, 1987, indictment naming <PERSON> Correa </PERSON> and seven other defendants. He said the government had no interest in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s testimony and declined further comment. <PERSON> Dresnick </PERSON> said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney representing North, told him by telephone Monday that his client `` indicated he will take the Fifth Amendment.'' `` If that's all that's going to happen, it's a little pointless to drag him out -LRB- to <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> -RRB- to say that,'' <PERSON> Dresnick </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, contacted Monday night, had declined to say whether <PERSON> North </PERSON> would appear in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and would not answer any other questions.

 More than 2,000 Libyan soldiers have entered northwestern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> to launch an offensive against <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>, the government radio of <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> said. <LOCATION> N'djamena </LOCATION> radio said the troops joined thousands of other soldiers already stationed in <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Darfour </LOCATION> province `` with the complicity of the <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> authorities.''

It added that <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> was planning an attack. <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> have been observing a cease-fire in their war over the disputed <LOCATION> Anzou </LOCATION> strip, a mineral-rich area that lies between the two countries. The cease-fire was arranged by the Organization of <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last September. <PERSON> Chad </PERSON> frequently has accused <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> of using <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> to launch attacks against it. `` As for <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> and its government, <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> reiterates its appeal for a sense of responsibility to avoid turning the Sudanese territory into a powder keg and an aggression base against a neighboring and brotherly country. Otherwise, <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> will assume its responsibility,'' the radio said.

<TEXT>
 Deposed President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> said his doctors once suspected he had cancer but surgery proved the diagnosis wrong, an uncle of President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> reported today. Rep. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Sumulong </PERSON> said through a spokesman that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> told him of the preliminary diagnosis when the two men met in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> in early February. He said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> had thyroid surgery in October, after which doctors ruled out cancer. On Tuesday, the Peoples Journal Tonight quoted <PERSON> Sumulong </PERSON> as saying that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was in declining health and may be suffering from cancer. A Marcos spokesman in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> denied the report in the <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> newspaper. Sumulong and Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s cousin, Rep. <PERSON> Egmidio </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanjuatco </PERSON>, met separately with <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> earlier this year in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, where the former president has lived since he was ousted in a military-civilian revolt in February 1986. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Leonie </PERSON> <PERSON> Tan </PERSON> confirmed the meetings but denied that the former president had used his health to strike any deals with the <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> government for his return. `` He's in excellent health,'' <PERSON> Tan </PERSON> said. `` He has regular medical check-ups and definitely does not have cancer.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> on Tuesday that before <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> would be allowed to return he must return billions of dollars he allegedly took from the country he ruled for 20 years. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> repeatedly has denied stealing money from the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Tan </PERSON> said he had not offered to pay any money back. `` No deal has been struck, indeed, not a single item on the agenda has been decided,'' <PERSON> Tan </PERSON> said. It is not known when negotiations for <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> return will start, `` but the desire from both sides is that talks begin immediately,'' <PERSON> Tan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> lives with his wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, in a mansion in the <LOCATION> Makiki </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> section of <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. Both have frequently expressed their desire to return to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, but can not because Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> revoked their passports shortly after assuming the presidency.

 A federal judge rebuked <ORGANIZATION> Shiloh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> True </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> for exploiting children and cited church members for contempt of court for violating federal child labor laws. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> also ordered two companies owned and operated by church members to pay $ 203,272 to cover a federal investigation and litigation expenses and to pay employees back wages and interest. The actions Tuesday further set back the church's campaign to stop what it calls government interference with its religious beliefs. <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> ruled that church members and the two companies _ <ORGANIZATION> McGee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Inc. of <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Wendell </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Woodwork </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Mint </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> _ violated his October 1987 order to obey federal child labor laws True Light families educate their children at home. The church also sponsors a job-training program that gives youths the opportunity to earn money while learning such trades as bricklaying, woodworking and sewing. Church members acknowledged during the trial they used their children, some as young as 9, at construction sites and in workshops where they carried bricks, laid foundations and more recently, operated forklifts and power saws. They said they had been doing that for at least 100 years. In October, <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> ordered children to stop working for the companies. When the owners of the companies continued the program for the church, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> asked they be found in contempt. In separate judgments, <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> ordered both companies again to obey the laws and warned that <ORGANIZATION> McGee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> would be fined $ 10,000 and <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON>'s Woodwork $ 5,000 for each day the companies remain in contempt of his order. In addition, <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> said <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON>'s two owners _ <ORGANIZATION> Wendell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Herbert </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> _ would be fined $ 500 each per day that they remained in contempt of his order. The five brothers who own <ORGANIZATION> McGee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> face fines of $ 1,000 per day each if they remain in contempt. <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> also ordered <ORGANIZATION> McGee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> to pay $ 133,890 in back wages and interest to employees who had not been paid minimum wages and for overtime work. Calls to both companies' offices and the offices of their attorneys for comment were not returned. `` We feel like our freedom of religion and freedom of worship has been violated,'' said <PERSON> Rommie </PERSON> <PERSON> Purser </PERSON>, the church's minister. `` We just plan to go on to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and see if we are n't being denied freedom of worship. In a January trial, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> charged the owners of the two companies _ all of whom are members of the church _ with violating the federal statute against child labor. The judge wrote in his 58-page opinion that the children employed `` are children doing adult's work, and regardless of the label defendants have attached to them, i.e. ` trainees in <ORGANIZATION> Shiloh </ORGANIZATION> Vocational Training Program,' they are manifestly being exploited by defendants in this case, whether or not they proclaim their purpose to be in furtherance of their religious beliefs.''

 Two Scandinavian <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> relief workers freed from 25 days in captivity said today that their Moslem abductors moved them often, did not reveal their identities and treated them well. Swede <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stening </PERSON>, 44, and Norwegian <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Jorgensen </PERSON>, 58, who were freed by their abductors Tuesday night, made the comments at a packed news conference at a hotel in Christian east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. `` We were very well treated during the whole period of captivity,'' said <PERSON> Stening </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jorgensen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Stening </PERSON> was speaking for `` both of us.'' <PERSON> Stening </PERSON> said neither of them had any idea about the identity of their captors, their motives or their demands. `` All our guards were masked,'' Stening said. `` We changed locations seven or eight times. We never knew where we were held at any time.'' `` We were held together ... Both of us were blindfolded at the beginning for an hour or so but then the blindfolds were removed and we were allowed to talk freely to each other,'' <PERSON> Stening </PERSON> said. `` We were moved from one location to another at night and in the trunks of the cars,'' Stening added. He said their captors `` interrogated us in a polite manner, asking such questions as the names of countries we worked at and the kind of jobs we had.'' After the news conference, the former hostages left <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> helicopter from Christian east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. They then departed <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, aboard a regular Swissair flight for their journey home. <PERSON> Stening </PERSON> said four gunmen kidnapped them near south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s provincial capital of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> as they were driving in a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> car from their base in the southern port of Tyre to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Feb. 5 Asked whether either one could tell if the kidnappers were Palestinians or Lebanese, judging by their accent, <PERSON> Stening </PERSON> said in English: `` No. We have n't the slightest idea. I do n't know Arabic.'' The two worked for the U.N. Relief and <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which cares for 280,000 Palestinian refugees in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jorgensen </PERSON> said `` yes'' when asked whether he would be willing to return to work for the agency in <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> after their ordeal. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fennessey </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, the agency's acting director, told reporters at the news conference that the two former captives `` wish to join their families as soon as possible and we're going to fulfill that'' request. The first word about the release came in a handwritten Arabic statement delivered to a Western news agency in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> late Tuesday. It was accompanied by a picture showing the two men. It said after they were `` proved innocent, they were released.'' The statement did not say what they had been accused of, but in earlier statements the group claimed the men were involved with the intelligence service of an unidentified foreign power. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials blamed the abductions on Palestinians acting individually for personal, not political, motives. The kidnappers of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, who was abducted in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> Feb. 17, said in a statement released Tuesday they would put him on trial. They accused <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> of working for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. The Organization of the Oppressed on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, which claimed <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' abduction, said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s crackdown on anti-occupation Palestinian riots in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> trip of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> `` make us more determined to try this criminal, <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>.''

Reporters in <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, 25 miles south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, said the two Scandinavians were turned over by their abductors at 8 p.m. Tuesday to <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> representative <PERSON> Salah </PERSON> <PERSON> Salah </PERSON>. They were then driven to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> by the militia of leftist Sunni Moslem leader <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Saad </PERSON>, who controlled the city since the 1975 outbreak of the Lebanese civil war. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, 43, was abducted near south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s ancient port of Tyre.

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A newspaper poll of Baptist ministers in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> shows former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> with a plurality of support in the influential group, despite its theological differences with the Republican presidential candidate. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> has said he has to win <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> primary Saturday, three days before the Super Tuesday primaries in other mostly Southern states. About 700,000 of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s 3 million people are <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptists </ORGANIZATION>, with about 2,000 ministers. A poll conducted last weekend by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> and The Atlanta Constitution showed <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> with the support of 31 percent of the ministers who plan to vote Saturday. Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was second at 24 percent, followed by 17 percent for <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and 10 percent for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>. Although <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> is a former <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> minister _ he stepped down as he began his presidential campaign _ he comes from a charismatic branch of the denomination, believing, among other things, in faith-healing and speaking in tongues. Most of the fundamentalist members of the denomination reject such teachings.

 State Republican party officials say the large turnout expected for Saturday's presidential primary is stretching their manpower to the limits.

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, buoyed by polls showing him with a comfortable lead in the South, said today no candidate can win the nomination without winning on Super Tuesday. `` You can not design a strategy to be president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> without doing well in the Super Tuesday states,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said at a breakfast with supporters here at the start of a campaign day that will take him to <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Tuesday he wants to keep `` a rather high plane'' in the closing days of the Super Tuesday campaign. But when asked about a television advertisement in which <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> attacks him on the Iran-Contra affair, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters: `` We'll see whether it helps him, but I think I have every right to set the record straight You ought not to be surprised if you see some comparative ads. `` You know, we're not going to sit out there unprotected,'' he added. After a swing through <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on Tuesday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> planned to breakfast today with senior citizens in <LOCATION> Pinellas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, then head on to <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> campaign events. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that he is confident but not cocky about the campaign for the March 8 Super Tuesday of 20 primaries and caucuses, most in the South. A <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Post-ABC poll released today gave him a 3-1 lead over <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. `` Two weeks ago yesterday, the polls -LRB- in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, where he won the primary -RRB- showed me on the canvas; and the voters said different.

 The mediator through nearly six years of peace talks on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> opened a crucial and perhaps final round today and said he was sure it would lead to the withdrawal of Soviet troops. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mediator <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> said `` difficult'' problems remained but that he believed both sides were determined to overcome them and reach a settlement as soon as possible. <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> said the negotiations would last as long as was necessary to forge that settlement. `` Perhaps it will be signed earlier than you think,'' he added. `` I have the impression that the Afghan people are tired of this conflict, that they will want peace,'' <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> said. He did not specify what problems remained, citing a need of confidentiality that allowed the parties to be `` flexible'' <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> spoke to reporters shortly before beginning his shuttle between the Pakistani and <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> delegations, seated in separate rooms in the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> office of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. The indirect format was adopted because <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, representing the anti-Marxist Afghan guerrillas, does not recognize the Soviet-backed Afghan government of President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> said he had been in contact with representatives of several countries, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, to discuss humanitarian aid to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> after a settlement. `` I have the feeling that there will be a broad international effort,'' he said. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> has insisted that pullout of the 115,000 Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> be accompanied by formation of a broad-based transitional government to replace the Afghan regime. The Soviets intervened in 1979 to back the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government against Moslem insurgents. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s chief negotiator, Minister of <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Zain </PERSON> <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON>, said <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> came to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> with a `` constructive attitude to finalize the text of the peace package.'' The head of the Afghan delegation, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakil </PERSON>, did not renew charges that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s demand for an interim government threatens to thwart a settlement. Both held separate news conferences on Tuesday. <PERSON> Wakil </PERSON> said he approached the talks with a `` sense of full optimism.'' Asked whether <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> would sign the peace package with the <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> government, <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON> said that would be decided after consultations in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> on Sunday with `` national leaders,'' including opposition leaders. The <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks will recess to allow <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON> to take part in those talks. <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> would continue to press for an interim government acceptable to all Afghans to be created in conjunction with a Soviet withdrawal. Otherwise, he said, there is a threat of new bloodshed preventing the return to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> of more than 3 million refuges from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and another 2 million from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. `` We also seek cooperation of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON>. `` We feel that after 8 -LCB- years of occupation, the Soviets owe it to the people of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> to give them a durable peace.'' <PERSON> Wakil </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> has no preconditions for the makeup of the future government. But seven Pakistan-based resistance movements that claim to speak for the about 200,000 Moslem guerrillas have ruled out any power-sharing with <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>. Last week, they presented their own plan for an `` Islamic government.'' <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> immediately rejected the plan, which <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON> described as a `` positive proposal.'' The talks have moved rapidly since Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s Feb. 8 announcement that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> would bring its troops home within 10 months starting May 15, provided a <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> settlement is signed by March 15. <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON> said the March 15 date `` is not all that important'' and that he is sure Soviet withdrawal plans would not be upset if the signing came later. He said the timetable for the pullout is now within `` negotiable range,'' but he indicated there are still considerable differences. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> wants at least half the Soviet troops to leave during the first three months of a pullout, <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has been vague on the subject, which is directly related to the question of a cutoff in Western aid to the guerrillas. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is reported to have given the guerrillas $ 700 million last year. <PERSON> Wakil </PERSON> said agreements already drawn up provide for the cutoff to coincide with the start of the Soviet pullout. The Afghan monarchy was overthrown in 1978 and a communist government was installed. The Soviets intervened at the request of the embattled new Marxist government.

 The doctor for three AIDS-exposed brothers who were ostracized in their hometown has retracted his diagnosis of AIDS-related complex for the oldest boy. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbosa </PERSON> testified at a hearing Tuesday that he earlier made the diagnosis for 11-year-old <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> because he felt compelled to under a judge's order. AIDS-related complex, or <ORGANIZATION> ARC </ORGANIZATION>, often is a precursor to acquired immune deficiency syndrome. There is no known cure for AIDS. `` The way I interpreted the order, I had no choice but to label this patient as having ARC against my clinical judgment,'' <PERSON> Barbosa </PERSON> told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>. The purpose of Tuesday's hearing was to clarify earlier reports that the physician had diagnosed ARC in the youth weeks before reporting it to the court. On Jan. 29, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kovachevich </PERSON> modified an earlier order and required <PERSON> Barbosa </PERSON> to report the progress of `` any AIDS, AIDS symptomology, or other AIDS-related syndrome.'' Her wording prompted him to say in his Feb. 2 report that <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> had developed <ORGANIZATION> ARC </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Barbosa </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> has not exhibited physical symptoms necessary for such a finding, although the boy's blood tests might support an ARC diagnosis, the doctor said. He also cited April 1987 guidelines issued by the federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> that prohibit labeling any child under age 13 as having ARC. `` It does n't mean much to the court that somebody has or does n't have <ORGANIZATION> ARC </ORGANIZATION>,'' Ms. <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> said `` When material changes in the boys' health occurs, it is not up to the court to try to look behind the medical reports to see what is there. When Ms. <PERSON> Kovachevich </PERSON> ruled Aug. 5, 1987, that the <ORGANIZATION> DeSoto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> system had to readmit the <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> brothers to regular classes, she ordered AIDS testing of the boys every six months and said any changes in their condition had to be reported to her. Ms. <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> told attorneys for the <ORGANIZATION> Rays </ORGANIZATION> and the school board to devise an improved way to keep the court informed about the hemophiliac brothers' medical conditions. The attorneys must submit the plan by Monday. <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>, 10, and <PERSON> Randy </PERSON>, 8, were banned from regular classes after they tested positive for the AIDS antibody in August 1986. Doctors say the children were apparently exposed to the AIDS virus through infusions of blood products that aim to promote clotting. Soon after the boys began school in <LOCATION> Arcadia </LOCATION> last fall, amid a boycott and protests by other students' parents, an arsonist torched the Ray home. Since then, the family has moved to <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION>, where the <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> children have attended public school without incident.

<TEXT>
 A group of 300 Austrians has asked state prosecutors to investigate whether President <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> can be prosecuted on suspicion of murder, a spokesman for the group said today. A petition asking that <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> be prosecuted in connection with his World War II service as an officer in the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> army has been circulating among intellectuals and at anti-Waldheim demonstrations for the past three weeks. The left-wing <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> magazine Falter today published the text of the complaint, which it said was signed by 300 people, including two prominent writers _ <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Jungk </PERSON> and <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Fried </PERSON>. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Oswalt </PERSON>, a journalist and spokesman for the group, said the complaint was sent to the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> state prosecutor's office by registered mail and was delivered this morning. Later, <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> asked state prosecutors to sue Falter on grounds of defamation and asked that it be removed from newsstands, the president's spokesman, <PERSON> Gerold </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON>, said. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> has initiated four other similar suits, including one against the West German news magazine <ORGANIZATION> Der </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spiegel </ORGANIZATION>, which published a document last month purportedly linking <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> to the deportation of civilians to prison camps in 1944. The magazine later said the document was a forgery and apologized for publishing it. A spokesman for the state prosecutor's office said privacy laws prevent the office confirming the receipt of the Austrian group's complaint The complaint quoted extensively from a historians' report on <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s wartime service, published Feb. 9, and from other material to back its request for an investigation of <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> on suspicion of murder. It cited an article in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s criminal code saying that `` not only the direct perpetrator commits the punishable act, but also a person who persuades another person to commit it, or who otherwise contributes to its perpetration.'' The historians' report concluded that <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> had concealed his record as a German army lieutenant in the <LOCATION> Balkans </LOCATION> during World War II. It also said he was in `` close proximity'' to some Nazi atrocities, knew about them and did nothing to prevent them. Christian, asked for a reaction to the complaint, said only that legal proceedings were constitutionally impossible. Under Article 63 of the Austrian constitution, a president can be prosecuted only if both houses of <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s parliament agree to it. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> has said the report exonerates him from accusations linking him to war crimes, but the historians left open the question of guilt. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> has consistently denied any links with alleged war crimes and has insisted he will stay in office despite increasing pressure to resign. He was elected to a six-year term in June 1986, three months after his service in the <LOCATION> Balkans </LOCATION> was first disclosed. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has barred <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as an undesirable alien. The Israeli member of the historians' commission, <PERSON> Yehuda </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, has said the report could serve as a basis for an investigation of whether <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> could be prosecuted. The West German historian on the panel, <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Messerschmidt </PERSON> said in an interview published Feb. 25 in the <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Sueddeutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeitung </ORGANIZATION> that legal steps could be considered over <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s role in the fate of <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> commandos executed in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> in 1944. Last month, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> ordered a renewed investigation into that episode by British authorities. Parts of <PERSON> Messerschmidt </PERSON>'s interview were quoted in the text of the complaint against <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>. <PERSON> Messerschmidt </PERSON> said in connection with the 1944 episode, `` I think that from the point of view of penal law, one could think about whether this was not assistance'' in murder. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Litzka </PERSON> said that, under Austrian law, the state prosecutors' office is bound to examine such a complaint and to deliver a recommendation to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> on whether or not to open legal proceedings.

 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said it pounded <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> with surface-to-surface missiles today for a third straight day and fired two rockets at <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s holy city of <LOCATION> Qom </LOCATION>, seat of <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s religious hierarchy. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said it launched three long-range missiles against the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> early today in retaliation. One Iranian missile hit <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> at daybreak, killing or wounding several civilians, including women and children, and destroying houses, shops and cars, the official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said without elaborating on the casualties. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said it had sent 19 missiles into the Iranian capital since Monday, including two today that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said wounded 15 civilians, among them eight women and five children. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s news agency reported a third missile was fired into <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> in the afternoon. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> will not bow to pressure, and that missile attacks `` make our nation stronger,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> reported. It was the first time <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has used surface-to-surface missiles on <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, a city of 6 million, since the Iran-Iraq war began in September 1980. It marks the worst escalation of the 3-year-old `` war of the cities'' that has killed thousands of civilians. The attack on <LOCATION> Qom </LOCATION> was <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s first with surface-to-surface missiles on the city 80 miles south of <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. The last time <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> warplanes bombed <LOCATION> Qom </LOCATION> was January 1987. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said the missiles used against <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> were of its own design and production, but <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said they were Soviet-supplied. Western military analysts believe the Iraqis are using Soviet-made Scud-B surface-to-surface missiles with `` strap-on'' booster rockets to give them extra range to reach <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, which is 290 miles from the Iraqi border. <LOCATION> Qom </LOCATION> is about the same distance from the border. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> also uses Scud-Bs to attack <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, but has an advantage because the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> capital is only 80 miles from the border. The <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the missiles on <LOCATION> Qom </LOCATION> were fired just before noon, but gave no other details of the attack on the city, which it called `` the center of charlatans and hypocrites.'' The agency reported a second attack on <LOCATION> Qom </LOCATION> in the early afternoon. The Iranian news agency said no casualties were reported in the strike on <LOCATION> Qom </LOCATION> before noon, but did not mention the later attack. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said 15 civilians suffered wounds in the latest attacks on <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Qom </LOCATION>, a city of 250,000 people, is home to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s main theological center and tomb of a Shiite Moslem saint. <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Montazeri </PERSON>, <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s designated successor, lives in <LOCATION> Qom </LOCATION>. Although the city is <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s seat, the 87-year-old supreme leader of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s fundamentalist revolution lives in suburban <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. He told families of war victims at his residence today: `` We fear nothing. For a martyrdom-lover it makes no difference to be martyred by a missile, a bomb or anything else,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> reported. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said Iranian artillery gunners, in retaliation for today's attacks on <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, shelled military and economic installations in the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> cities of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ammara </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Badra </PERSON>, <PERSON> Zorbatiya </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharqi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Gharbi </PERSON> <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said it began the missile barrage of <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> to retaliate for two pre-dawn Iranian rockets on <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> on Monday. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said the missiles were in retaliation for Iraqi air raids on the <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> oil refinery last week. The Iraqi and Iranian dispatches were monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Early Water Stoppage Causes Man to Burn Scalp</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VENTNOR, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A water stoppage that took place about 30 minutes earlier than announced left a man with a burned scalp. At 7:30 a.m. Monday, <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Ventnor </LOCATION>, applied a caustic hair relaxer to his scalp. Fifteen minutes later, he ducked his head under the shower, only to discover there was no water. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> knew a new water main was being connected as part of a road reconstruction, but residents had been notified that water would be turned off about 8:15 a.m. Faced with a scalp that was beginning to burn, <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON>, first tried to bail some water out of the bottom of the bathtub. Then they tried melting ice cubes on his head. `` It started burning more and more,'' <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> considered rinsing his hair with any liquid in the refrigerator, but was worried about chemical reactions, he said. He shouted for workers on the street to turn his water back on, but said they laughed. The couple then called a poison hot line, asking for an ambulance to bring water. But the message got garbled by the time it got to emergency officials: `` The dispatcher said this guy had shampoo in his hair, and could we send a bucket of water over,'' is how fire Capt. <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabo </PERSON> recalls it. An ambulance was deemed unnecessary. The Dennises wound up driving to a hospital, where <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> was treated for first-degree burns.

<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A spokesman says shrimpers will defy a federal regulation requiring the use of devices designed to save endangered sea turtles, despite a federal judge's decision to enforce the regulation. To further complicate matters, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wildlife </LOCATION> and Fisheries agents are prohibited by state law from enforcing the federal regulation requiring use of turtle excluder devices, which shrimpers claim could ruin their business. Federal enforcement of the regulations began Tuesday after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> threw out a suit by shrimpers that claimed that the devices cut down on their shrimp catches and are n't effective. But <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> is bound by a state law forbidding enforcement of the federal law, said <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowman </PERSON>, assistant chief of the seafood division. `` We'll have to consult with legal counsel before we know what to do,'' he said. Tee <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mialjevich </PERSON>, spokesman for Concerned Shrimpers of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, vowed defiance despite <PERSON> Carr </PERSON>'s ruling. `` I do n't care if he upheld it. It's a bad law, and the shrimpers ai n't going to live by it,'' he said. The law also went into effect Tuesday in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> waters, and has been in effect in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> since Jan. 1. <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> waters wo n't open to shrimping for two months, but big boats work year-round in federal waters beyond the three-mile limit. <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> patrols caught six shrimp boats working without the devices since the law went into effect in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Montero </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said by telephone from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. There were no reports of violations Tuesday, she said. The maximum civil penalty is $ 10,000, but first-time offenders will probably be fined $ 5,000 to $ 7,500, she said. Under the law, most shrimpers will be required to use the cage-like devices to save turtles protected under the Endangered Species Act. The devices, which fit in shrimp nets, have slats to force a trapped turtle out of a flap, but critics say they do n't always work that way Critics said sometimes shrimp escape and debris gets caught in the frame and ruins the net. <PERSON> Mialjevich </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> shrimpers experienced catch reductions of 35 percent to 50 percent. `` I'm telling you myself _ personally _ I'm not going to pull a TED -LRB- turtle exclusion device -RRB-, because I ca n't make a living. I'll lose everything I've accumulated in 45 years ... I ca n't take a 1 percent shrimp loss. How am I going to take a 35 percent loss?'' said <PERSON> Mialjevich </PERSON>. <PERSON> Carr </PERSON> had said in advance that his ruling would not determine the effectiveness of the devices, but would address only whether the government had followed proper procedures.

 Assemblies of God leaders in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> have rejected a request by national church officials to toughen their recommended sanctions against evangelist <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, a church official says. <PERSON> Juleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Turnage </PERSON>, spokeswoman at church headquarters in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, said today that national church officers have not been informed of any decision by the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> district. The <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Tuesday the 19-member state presbytery decided at a nine-hour meeting Monday in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION> to resubmit its original recommeendation that <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> be barred from preaching for three months as part of a two-year program of rehabilitation. The official said it would now be up to national Assemblies of God officials to decide whether to accept the state panel's recommendation The Assemblies' General Presbytery has a regular session scheduled March 29, but an emergency session could be convened sooner. Mrs. <PERSON> Turnage </PERSON> said at least three of the officers must attend any meeting of the Executive Presbytery. She said it would be at least Thursday before three of the officials will be back in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Turnage </PERSON> said she talked by telephone Tuesday night with the Rev. <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, the general superintendent of the church, who said he believes it would be unprecedented for a state presbytery to reject the national church's recommendations. Asked about reports last week from from friends of <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> that he might leave the church if he feels the punishment is too harsh, Mrs. <PERSON> Turnage </PERSON> said national officers have heard nothing directly from <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>. `` We're not dealing with a radical or a rebel here. If he does leave the church, it will be because his ministry ca n't survive without him. It will be a pragmatic decision,'' she said. `` I think he is very committed to the church,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Turnage </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Presbytery </LOCATION>'s original sanction was a two-year rehabilitation program that also included counseling for <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, who heads a ministry that reportedly takes in $ 150 million a year. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> stepped down from the pulpit Feb. 21, telling the congregation at his <ORGANIZATION> Baton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> worship center in a tearful confession that he had sinned against his wife and God. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> reportedly paid a prostitute to pose nude for him and then tried to make a deal with a minister who confronted him about it. The national presbytery reportedly recommended barring <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> from the pulpit and television for a year, with an additional year of regulation of his ministry afterward. A <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Assemblies of God official contacted Tuesday night by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> confirmed that the state panel stood by its previous punishment for the evangelist. The decision originally was reported by KATC-TV of Layfayette. When asked if <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> officials had sent back their original censure to the church's national leaders, the source said, `` It would be correct to say that.'' <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Janway </PERSON>, the Assemblies of God district superintendent for <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, had said any actions made Monday by the state board would not be made public. There was no indication whether <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> attended that meeting. The Rev. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Rentz </PERSON>, who is substituting for <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> at his Family Worship Center, did attend. <PERSON> Forrest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, secretary-treasurer of the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> district council, acknowledged Monday that national Assemblies of God representatives also were at the meeting.

 Four sheriff's deputies today forcibly evicted the last resident of The <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> <PERSON> Motel </PERSON>, where <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> was assassinated 20 years ago. <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who has lived at the motel for 11 years, refused to obey an eviction order, in protest of attempts to build an $ 8.8 million museum at the site. She has said the project would force poor people out of the neighborhood. King was shot by an assassin April 4, 1968, while in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> to help organize a strike by sanitation workers. `` You people are making a mistake. You people are making a mistake,'' <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said, sobbing, as four <LOCATION> Shelby </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> deputies carried her in a kneeling position from the balcony outside her second-floor room to the sidewalk in front of the motel. `` I refuse to stand up,'' she said as the deputies walked away. `` I'm trying to help the people who live in this area. We're being forced out. You people are wrong.'' Miss <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> has been holed up at the motel since Jan. 11, when it was closed by state officials directing the museum project. She ignored a state deadline Feb. 8 to move out and likened her protest to civil rights battles staged by King. Before the deputies arrived, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> talked to reporters and about 10 other spectators through an eight-foot chain link fence that was put up around the site Jan. 11. `` My family is here and I have a home, but that's not what I want,'' she said. `` If I ca n't live at <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lorraine </LOCATION>, I'll camp out on the sidewalk out front.'' <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, an administrative assistant for the <LOCATION> Shelby </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's office, said deputies used a tire iron to force open the door to <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s room, just three doors down from the room where King was killed.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> will require The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to install 10 exit doors in its new 747 passenger jetliners, rather than the eight the company prefers, the agency's chief said today. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee that for safety reasons, he had decided to issue a final rule that would require the additional doors and expected it to be ready by late summer. A <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> official, however, told the lawmakers that having eight doors would be safe. `` Prudence,'' <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said when asked during a break in the hearing about why he had made his decision. `` Just a concern of safety.'' <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> plans to soon begin building a new line of the wide-body 747s, whose first generation went into service in 1970. The aircraft, which can carry more than 500 passengers, are the most frequently used jetliners for international travel and are also commonly used for coast-to-coast flights within the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. There are currently eight-exit versions of the 747s used by foreign airlines, but they carry only 440 passengers. <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> investigations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> that the new rule would require a maximum of 60 feet between exit doors for aircraft flown by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines. This would, in effect, require 10 doors in the 747s. In testimony prepared for delivery to the subcommittee, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> Orvil </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roetman </PERSON> contested <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON>'s decision. `` Data, tests, in-service experience and analysis all show that the 747 distances between exit doors, with either eight or 10 doors on the main deck, are more than adequate for providing safe evacuation,'' he said.

 A businessman was accused of diverting more than $ 8,000 in surplus government food intended for school lunch programs to his catering business and restaurants. <PERSON> Siinto </PERSON> <PERSON> Wessman </PERSON>, 70, was cited Tuesday in a criminal complaint in state district court with two counts of fraud. From 1981 through June 1986, <PERSON> Wessman </PERSON>'s catering firm, the <ORGANIZATION> Neal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, had contracts with the Mountain Iron-Buhl, <PERSON> Biwabik </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> school districts to provide hot lunches under the federal Child Nutrition Program. The contracts allowed the catering firm to obtain surplus government commodites, including cheese, hamburger and butter, for use in the school programs. The criminal complaint alleges <PERSON> Wessman </PERSON> diverted the food to two restaurants, which have since closed, and to his catering business. `` The charges are absolutely false,'' <PERSON> Wessman </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` I do n't know anything about it.'' The charges each carry penalties of up to 10 years in prison and a $ 20,000 fine.

He is expected to make stops in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> before returning to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> next weekend. <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, told reporters earlier today, `` The President has said on a number of occasions the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants a more visible role in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> in terms of trying to be helpful, that we were willing and eager to participate in any way that could move the peace process forward.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spokesman said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> was doing `` yeoman's work'' in trying to promote negotiations. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, who demanded anonymity, said <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> had not `` thrown cold water'' on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> initiative but also had not endorsed it. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> had a similar reaction. `` If I had to describe the situation, I would say that nobody has signed up to our proposals, but everybody wants us to keep working,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said Tuesday in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben-Aharon </PERSON>, director-general of <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s office, said both <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had asked <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> to continue his mediation effort, however. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> saw <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> briefly Tuesday night on the president's arrival from <LOCATION> Washingtoon </LOCATION>, but ` they really did n't get a chance'' to talk about the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said `` We will see where it goes from here,'' the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spokesman said. `` There is no decision at this point.'' <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> is demanding an active Soviet role in peace talks and participation by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> as he sole representative of the 1.5 million Palestinian Arabs who live under Israeli control in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, menawhile, refuses to deal with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which is considered to be a terrorist group both by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and wants also to block participation by the Soviets, who have backed <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> positions in the past and do not have diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> has made a point of emphasizing a need for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> communications with the Palestinians, despite a ban on <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> contacts. `` There's not a substitute for directly sitting down with people,'' he said Tuesday. `` And that's in a sense what we've been calling for all along.''

<TEXT>
 Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said today he would try to persuade Western governments to break all diplomatic ties with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> until it eased restrictions on anti-apartheid groups. `` We want to tell the South African government that they do not deserve to be part of a decent society,'' he said at a news conference. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said Western nations should cut any diplomatic links with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and expel South African diplomats from their countries. `` <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> have kept saying that sanctions hurt blacks and sanctions are not effective,'' he said. `` While not withdrawing my support for economic sanctions, I am saying to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and other Western countries, ` Here is your chance.''' <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> was in the Kenyan capital for a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> All-African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, which he heads. He said he has called in the past for Western governments to break relations with <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>. But he said this time he intended to actively campaign for such a move. `` My own intention now is to challenge the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> to break off diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, to expel South African diplomats from their countries until certain conditions are met,'' the churchman said. Those conditions are a lifting of the state of emergency, reversal of a Feb. 25 ruling that outlawed political activity by 18 opposition groups, and the release of political detainees, especially children. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize, and other churchmen were arrested Monday when they attempted to march on the South African <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> to protest the crackdown on black opposition groups. The Rev. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reformed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, also was arrested. In an interview with `` CBS This Morning'' from <LOCATION> Harare </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, he said it is clear that the government now is outlawing `` all legitimate peaceful activity,'' and that apartheid opponents have no choice but to resist. `` And if that means confrontation, if that means disobedience to your unjust laws then I think that is exactly what we mean,'' he said. `` We are talking about the possibility of civil disobedience.'' He said non-violent protests have ended in deaths in the past but wo n't be a deterrent to civil disobedience. `` We will have to take the risks that go with it and we will have to take the consequences that follow these actions of ours,'' he said.

Besides four years worth of unpaid legal fees for the shooting in a subway train, <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> is being sued for $ 63 million by three of the four black teen-agers he shot. The inheritance `` wo n't go very far in defending him on anything,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelner </PERSON>, who has defended <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> free of charge in the civil cases. <PERSON> Kelner </PERSON> also said Tuesday that he planned to drop <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> as a client, saying <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> has been `` uncooperative.'' <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> last October was sentenced to six months in jail and five years probation for carrying an unlicensed gun, which he used to shoot the young men.

<HEAD>Court Gives Cities Additional Protection From Lawsuits in Missouri
Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today gave cities, at least for now, additional protection from lawsuits that accuse lower-ranking city officials of violating the rights of employees. By a 7-1 vote, the justices threw out a $ 15,000 award <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> was ordered to pay <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Praprotnik </PERSON>, a fired city architect. But the seven justices voting to overturn the award were sharply split in their reasoning. Only four justices joined in the court's main opinion, leaving open the possibility that a future case could prompt a different result Today's ruling, therefore, may leave local officials confused over what standards apply in determining when cities can be held legally responsible for violating individual rights. Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, who wrote the court's main opinion, said cities may not be held liable unless those who claim their rights were violated prove the `` existence of an unconstitutional municipal policy.'' She said <PERSON> Praprotnik </PERSON> can not win his case by claiming that high-ranking city officials _ such as the mayor and city aldermen _ failed to override decisions by subordinates who may have violated <PERSON> Praprotnik </PERSON>'s rights. `` Simply going along with discretionary decisions made by one's subordinates ... is not a delegation to them of the authority to make policy,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said <PERSON> Praprotnik </PERSON> was a manager in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>' community development agency when in 1980 he became embroiled with his superiors over the proposed installation by the city of a controversial sculpture. <PERSON> Praprotnik </PERSON> was suspended for 15 days but the city civil service commission reinstated him with back pay. Then in 1982 he was transferred to another city agency, the heritage and urban design division, and his job responsibilities were reduced. The transfer also meant a loss in seniority that exposed him to being laid off. He was fired Dec. 30, 1983, a day after he was released from a hospital where he had undergone surgery. The layoff cost him his income, more than 500 hours of accumulated sick leave and other pension and vacation benefits. City officials said he was fired for budgetary reasons. <PERSON> Praprotnik </PERSON> then sued under a federal civil rights law, charging he was shunted to a dead-end job and then kicked out because of his appeal to the civil service commission for his suspension back in 1980. A jury awarded him $ 30,000. The 8th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> reduced the amount to $ 15,000. The appeals court said there was sufficient evidence to support <PERSON> Praprotnik </PERSON>'s claim that he was fired for exercising his constitutional rights. The appeals court said the city was liable, even though the jury exonerated the individual officials sued by <PERSON> Praprotnik </PERSON>. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said the appeals court's ruling was too broad in allowing the city to be sued based on decisions made by those who lacked policy-making authority. Federal courts are not `` justified in assuming that municipal policy-making authority lies somewhere other than where the applicable -LRB- state -RRB- law purports to put it,'' she said.

He was joined by Justices <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON>.

 A ship carrying incinerator ash from <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> wo n't be allowed to return to tie up here until there is an agreement about cleaning up 2,000 to 4,000 tons of ash reportedly left in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, a lawyer says. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, attorney for <ORGANIZATION> Joseph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paolino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which has a contract with the city to dispose of the ash, said the <LOCATION> Khian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> would be allowed to dock at <PERSON> Paolino </PERSON>'s pier only after there is an agreement on cleaning up the ash in <LOCATION> Gonaives </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. `` We want an enforceable covenant that the material will be removed from <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> or disposed of in an environmentally sound manner,'' <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON>, president of the ship's operator, <ORGANIZATION> Amalgamated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <ORGANIZATION> Freeport </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, declined to comment when reached at his office by The <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inquirer </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said <PERSON> Paolino </PERSON> will not be paid unless it can show the ash has been disposed of legally. The ship had been turned away from six countries while wandering the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> seeking a dumping spot. It anchored at the mouth of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> Lewes </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, on Tuesday. In addition to the question about the ash in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, the ship's 80-mile voyage up the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> was delayed by inspections and a pier fire The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> refused to allow the ship to proceed until it passed an inpsection by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said this morning that the ship passed an inspection conducted Tuesday, and that the captain of the port has determined the ship is `` safe to transit <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> waters,'' the coast guard said. No time was set for the <LOCATION> Khian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> to travel upriver. Its radar system still did n't work and the <ORGANIZATION> coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> guard </ORGANIZATION> said the ship is restricted to daytime traveling. The environmental group <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> has labeled the <LOCATION> Khian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>'s cargo toxic State tests conducted when the ash was loaded found no dangerous levels of toxins, and recent federal tests from the same incinerator came to the same conclusions. The Fire Department, meanwhile, is investigating a rubbish fire at the Paolini pier this morning. The fire damaged a transfer station, a company official said. <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said the city will appoint an independent engineering firm to determine the safety of the pier and whether the <LOCATION> Khian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> will be able to dock there. <PERSON> Paolino </PERSON> is expected to send the residue to an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> landfill, where the bulk of the city's ash has been dumped for the past two years, said <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Rosalynn Carter Urges New Mental Health Spending as House
Considers Bill</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Former first lady <PERSON> Rosalynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said Wednesday that mental illness was <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s No. 1 health problem as a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel opened hearings on a plan to increase spending on care and services for mentally ill senior citizens. The `` Elderly Mental Health Initiative'' advanced by Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Roybal </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., would increase outlays for community-based services for the elderly and their families, on research into prevention, treatment and services, and on training for health care professionals It also would lift the lifetime limit on inpatient psychiatric care paid by <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> and expand <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> to cover more outpatient and community-based mental health services. And it would require Medicaid to cover community-based services as well. In addition, the <PERSON> Roybal </PERSON> bill would create a consumer bill of rights and set up a national mental health education program. `` Now is the time for federal action,'' <PERSON> Roybal </PERSON> said in opening a hearing on the subject. `` For far too long, mental health care has been a neglected priority.'' The <PERSON> Roybal </PERSON> bill would authorize $ 161 million in new spending in its first year, most of it to expand mental health grants to states. The money does not include added expenditures under the <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> and Medicaid programs, for which <PERSON> Roybal </PERSON> did not provide an estimate. According to a report compiled by <PERSON> Roybal </PERSON>'s House Select Committee on Aging, between 15 percent and 25 percent of Americans over 65, about 7 million people, have significant mental health problems. Very few receive appropriate care, the report said. Mrs. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> told <PERSON> Roybal </PERSON>'s committee the federal government needs to pay more attention to mental health needs and spend more on them She called mental health `` America's No. 1 health problem.'' She recommended substantially higher spending channeled through states, improvements in <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> and Medicaid coverage, and strengthening of patient advocacy services such as the nursing home ombudsman program. `` One of my most urgent pleas is for adequate insurance coverage for mental illnesses,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said. `` I think the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should do everything possible to assure this coverage. It is is another of our sadly neglected needs.'' <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> stressed the need for community-based services for the elderly and the relatives who take care of them. `` It is a family and community issue. It impacts on all of us at one time or another,'' he said. `` Many of us here today know firsthand the responsibility of caring for an elderly family member.'' Rep. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., said more than 25 percent of all suicides are committed by the elderly, `` indicating in many cases the desperation that they feel. He also said more than half the patients in nursing homes have Alzheimer's disease.

 It might have sounded corny if said by someone else, someplace else. But this was <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, and the praise of her presidential candidate husband struck a pleasing chord with her fellow <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolinians </LOCATION>. `` He kind of reminds me of a laser beam,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. `` I'm in awe of the way he can cut through the complexities of a tough issue and come up with an answer. The crowd responded with applause and approving smiles. Standing atop a platform in the parking lot of a suburban office complex, the former transportation secretary spoke with feeling about the decision she had made days before to relinquish her Cabinet post and become a full-time campaigner. `` This is where my roots are,'' said the one-time debutante and beauty queen from <LOCATION> Salisbury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> `` This is home. This is where I draw my strength.'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> boasts a superior organization and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> has his `` invisible army,'' but <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> has had his own not-so-secret weapon in the battle for Southern votes next week on Super Tuesday. The weapon, he says, is <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> _ known as <PERSON> Liddy </PERSON> _ whose old-South charm and <ORGANIZATION> Ivy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> credentials propelled her from small-town <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> to the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Cabinet. She has shown a talent for holding crowds in the palm of her hand. `` She's a vivacious, bright, enthusiastic campaigner,'' said <PERSON> Haley </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbour </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> consultant and former political adviser in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> White House. `` I think other Southerners will feel a kinship to her.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> agreed last fall to step down as transportation secretary and hit the campaign trail, making what she said was one of the toughest decisions of her life. Some feminists complained, saying she had squandered on opportunity to debunk the traditional image of the candidate's wife. But Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, 51, said there was nothing demeaning about her change of course. `` I mean, this is a challenging assignment to be discussing national and international issues with the press and the public,'' she said then. `` I will be lucky if I get to see <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> very much at all. It is not just standing at his side and smiling.'' She spent the fall crisscrossing the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, speaking at rallies, giving interviews, lining up commitments among <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> activists and raising money for the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> senator. Observers say the final vote counts on Tuesday may well show Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, not Senate Republican Leader <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, the big winner in the South. But that would n't mean Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> failed, they say. `` She's a charmer, but there's only so much you can do,'' said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Arrington </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> activist and political scientist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Archie </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> campaign's deputy press secretary, said, `` She laid the groundwork for our presence in the South. She represents the region, can pull in a crowd, and her experience in the administration is useful.'' She's also been credited with helping <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> change the image as a slashing campaigner acquired in his 1976 quest for the vice presidency. She speaks of his compassion and courage, qualities she says are most evident close-up. Campaign strategists considered Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s vote-getting potential important enough to hustle her to <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> in the weeks leading up to that state's caucuses _ which <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> won. Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> grew up in a small, conservative town in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION>, the only daughter of well-to-do parents. She was a debutante at age 18 and two years later was student body president of the Women's College at <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. She graduated from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> and went to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, where she spent two decades in various government posts including the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. In 1976, shortly after her marriage to <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, she took a leave of absence to help him run for vice president. In 1979, she quit the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> to join <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s presidential campaign.

<TEXT>
 Israeli troops hunting for Arab protesters today fired tear gas into the reception area of a hospital emergency room, driving out dozens of elderly patients, doctors said. Palestinians hurled firebombs and troops fired tear gas in scattered clashes throughout the night in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, where violent protests have occurred daily since Dec. 8. Violence erupted for the second consecutive day at the government-run <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> about eight miles north of <LOCATION> Jersusalem </LOCATION>, the latest in a recent series of intense clashes at medical facilities in the occupied territories. About a dozen <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops outside the hospital compound were confronted by rock-hurling Palestinian protesters who blocked a nearby street. One smoking canister landed in the reception area of the emergency room and another landed in a hospital courtyard, doctors said. Two physicians donned gas masks and others held onions to their noses to blunt the effects of the tear gas, one doctor said. About 30 patients, including elderly people, were driven outside. `` Even the doctors could n't breathe, so imagine the effects on the patients inside, many of whom are seriously ill,'' said a doctor who spoke on condition of anonymity. Arab doctors say injured Palestinians often are reluctant to come to hospitals for fear of being arrested by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities while under treatment. But hospitals also have often become refuges for Arab demonstrators fleeing arrest after violent confrontations with soldiers. Soldiers detained three youths outside the hospital, including one with a gash on his forehead and bleeding from the shoulder. He was seen being dragged by a soldier. On Tuesday, three soldiers had burst into the same hospital, fired tear gas and rubber bullets and struck two doctors with their rifles as they looked for demonstrators, doctors there said. An army spokesman denied soldiers entered the hospital or beat doctors. He said soldiers detained two Palestinians, but that the youths were taken into custody at the entrance to the hospital. In the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, officials at the <LOCATION> Shifa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> sodliers entered the facility overnight and arrested two Arab demonstrators accused by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> of trying to run over a soldier with their car. At least 76 Palestinians have been killed, mostly by Israeli gunfire, and hundreds wounded since Dec. 8 in the territories <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. Also today, three Italian legislators chained themselves to electric poles near <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> to protest the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> crackdown. One legislator held a sign saying: `` Stop the Killing _ Yes, To Palestinian Self-Determination.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right - and left-wing politicians disagreed today about the future of Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s peace initiative after hearing reports of his meeting Tuesday with <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> had just finished a four-day diplomatic shuttle in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> trying to gain acceptance of a formula for talks to deal with Palestinian unrest in the occupied lands and an overall Arab-Israeli settlement. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> legislator <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Meridor </PERSON>, a close aide to right-wing Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, today said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> `` was unhappy because of the positions we are hearing from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'' following talks between <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. `` King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> says the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> must be involved in the peace process and he wants a full-scale international conference,'' <PERSON> Meridor </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>. `` If that's progress, I do n't know what going backwards is. But former Foreign Minister <PERSON> Abba </PERSON> <PERSON> Eban </PERSON>, a legislator from the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said the differences between <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> could be bridged.

 A deaf man mistaken for an auto theft suspect was clubbed with a nightstick, sparking complaints from his sister and an internal police investigation. `` We made a mistake, no doubt about it. I do n't know what went wrong,'' police spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` Sometimes in the heat of trying to catch somebody, it's going to happen and it's unfortunate that it did `` I think -LRB- the officer's -RRB- main concern was he thought he had somebody that was going to get away from him,'' <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jeffery </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 21, suffered shoulder bruises Monday night. `` The main thing is he does n't understand why he was struck. He keeps asking why,'' said his sister, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON>, who shares her home with <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. She filed a complaint with police. The incident began when Officer <PERSON> Delier </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> gave chase to a car that had refused to pull over. The chase led to an apartment complex, where the car's two occupants parked the vehicle and fled. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> had just helped two maintenance workers at the complex free a tractor from a ditch when <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> arrived. The officer approached <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who raised his hand to his ear _ the signal used by the deaf to indicate they ca n't hear. <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> ordered him to the ground, said apartment resident <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Borreo </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> put up his hand and the cop just started hitting him,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Borreo </PERSON> said. `` He hit him with his stick on the leg. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> bent down to grab his leg, and he hit him again on the left shoulder. Then the cop pushed him down.'' She and her husband said <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> held <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s hands behind his back while another officer handcuffed him and put him in a patrol car. `` I said, ` You got the wrong guy. He lives here and I saw him not five minutes ago,''' apartment manager <PERSON> Iris </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> said. Within 30 minutes, the officers released <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. Later Monday, two people were arrested on charges of grand theft auto and resisting arrest without violence. After those arrests, <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> filed a report saying he mistakenly tried to apprenhend <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who he thought was ignored his order to lay down.

 President <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Houphouet-Boigny </PERSON> says his family is paying for a huge new basilica whose construction has attracted attention during the West African nation's economic crisis. <PERSON> Houphouet-Boigny </PERSON> told a visiting French boy's choir the government would never pay for construction of a church building because the nation was made up of many religious faiths.

 Leaders of the Western alliance today endorsed President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s efforts to negotiate new reductions in nuclear arms and demanded sweeping cutbacks in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s vastly superior conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to rule out a surprise attack Within hours of opening their first summit talks in six years, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and leaders of 15 other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nations declared that Soviet conventional forces `` cast a shadow over the whole of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'' and must be reduced sharply to ease the imbalance in East-West military strength. These proposed cutbacks, they said, `` will entail, for example, the elimination from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> of tens of thousands of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact weapons relevant to surprise attack, among them tanks and artillery pieces.'' The overall aim of the talks was to demonstrate allied unity in advance of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s planned <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit meeting with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in late May or June. But there were nagging differences among the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders over other nuclear arms issues. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, his voice hoarse and rasping from allergies, summoned reporters to the steps of his 19th century palace residence, the <LOCATION> Chateau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stuyvenberg </LOCATION>, to read his own statement on the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> declaration. The president called the massive Soviet conventional forces `` the most direct threat to our security and to stability in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' He added: `` But arms reductions are not enough. ... We also look for greater respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms on which lasting security and stability in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> ultimately depend.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> seemed undisturbed by frictions among <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders about the future of the U.S.-supplied force of short-range nuclear weapons, most of them based in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` I have never seen such harmony as we have,'' the president said. He called the statement on European conventional forces `` a major step'' forward for the allies. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also announced he was sending Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> back to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> after the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit ends Thursday to press his talks with <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders. `` All countries in the region believe it is useful for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to remain engaged in this process,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` We will spare no effort in our search for a comprehensive peace settlement.'' At the opening summit session earlier today, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> sat next to <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and listened intently as <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General Lord <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON> pledged the allies' `` full support'' for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s drive to reach agreement with the Soviets on drastic cuts in strategic nuclear weapons. But, <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON> declared, `` the alliance will not rest on its laurels.'' In a six-page statement on conventional forces, the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders said: `` The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s military presence in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, at a level far in excess of its needs for self-defense, directly challenges our security as well as our hopes for change in the political situation in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` Thus, the conventional imbalance in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> remains at the core of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s security concerns.'' The allied leaders spelled out demands for far bigger cutbacks in Soviet conventional forces than in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>'s military levels, during negotiations to begin in earnest this fall in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, with representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> consisting of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and six East European allies. `` Our aim will be to establish a situation in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in which force postures as well as the numbers of deployments and weapons systems no longer make surprise attack and large-scale offensive action a feasible option,'' the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> statement said. <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON> said the alliance leaders had gathered to celebrate the new U.S.-Soviet ban on edium-range missiles, and for `` charting the way ahead'' as <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> pursues a peace offensive. `` One agreement which reduces some weapons, and indeed one new Soviet leader who is ready to reduce some tensions, however significant, do not in themselves remove the military capability and potential of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON> said. He added that <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s `` collective determination to deploy and maintain a military capacity where necessary were what convinced the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> of the better route of arms control and disarmament.'' `` We wish President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his negotiators well in the effort to secure an agreement on strategic arms reduction, which has the alliance's full support,'' <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was the last of the leaders to arrive at sprawling <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> headquarters today for the opening session of two days of summit talks that are expected to stress alliance unity despite differences over nuclear arms strategy. At the first closed meeting, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> reportedly underlined the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commitment to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and urged his fellow leaders to guard against Soviet attempts to divide the Western alliance. It was West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> who touched on a simmering dispute over whether <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> members should quickly improve their stocks of short-range nuclear missiles, most of which are deployed in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` The load, the risks and the responsibilities of our defense must be equally shared by all members,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s remarks, made public by <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> officials, alluded to the fundamental issue of how the alliance can fill the gap left by the <LOCATION> Reagan-Gorbachev </LOCATION> agreement last December to eliminate ground-launched, intermediate-range nuclear misiles from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Senior <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> officials drafting a final communique to be published Thursday sought to bridge differences ranging from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s reluctance to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s enthusiasm for a swift decision on modernization to internal divisions over the issue within the French government. Looking toward Soviet-American arms talks, <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON> said an improved Soviet human rights record was fundamental to creating `` the confidence necessary to proceed with a radical arms control agenda.'' He added: `` For most of us in the West that cause -LRB- of tension -RRB- is the degree of mistrust created by the denial of basic human rights and freedom to the peoples of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON> reaffirmed <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s commitment supporting a proposed superpower agreement to reduce long-range nuclear weaponry by 50 percent on both sides. He said <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> also looked forward to `` a more serious engagement'' with the Soviet-led <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> on a chemical weapons ban and reducing the Eastern bloc's superiority in conventional arms. As the meeting began, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> reported that `` progress is fine'' on drafting a statement of common alliance goals to be issued at the conclusion of the two-day summit. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who reached <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> coughing and complaining of allergies, ws to spend 2 1-2 hours conferring with the 15 other heads of state or government. When he arrived Tuesday, the president tried to allay concerns over the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION>'s advantage in conventional forces by promising to keep <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> `` as long as Europeans want them to stay.''

<HEAD>Soviets Report Arrests, Possible Deaths in Ethnic Rioting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL PUTZEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police arrested people involved in ethnic rioting in a southern republic, the official media said today, and the government acknowledged that others may have been killed during the massive unrest. A radio station and newspaper in <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Azerbaidzhan </LOCATION>, reported also that the republic's premier, <PERSON> Gasan </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidov </PERSON>, had traveled to the affected area. `` The unrest has been stopped. Businesses and establishments of trade and public eating are working in a normal rhythm and classes are taking place in schools and other educational establishments,'' the <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION> Worker newspaper reported. The newspaper's article, referring to the Azerbaidzhan city of <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION>, was read to The Associated Press by Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>. `` Order and peace have been ensured by law enforcement organs. People caught in the unrest have been detained,'' the <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION> Worker newspaper reported. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said in a telephone interview that he could not confirm rumors circulated by <LOCATION> Armenian </LOCATION> activists that as many as 20 people had been killed in <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION>. But he added, `` There was hooliganism and there can be deaths in such cases.'' On Tuesday, <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> told a news briefing that authorities clamped a curfew on <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION>. He suggested the unrest in <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION>, and demonstrations and violence elsewhere in the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> region in which at least two people died, were due to a `` mistake'' made 65 years ago when a territory composed largely of Armenians was made part of neighboring <LOCATION> Azerbaidzhan </LOCATION>. He said `` there were certain injuries'' in <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION>, an industrial city of more than 160,000 people in <LOCATION> Azerbaidzhan </LOCATION> where hooligans were blamed for touching off the Sunday riot. `` The situation is calm there today, but it is tense,'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said at the Tuesday briefing. Moscow-based foreign journalists have been barred from the region, and only sporadic reports from witnesses, activists and the official media have reached the Soviet capital. Most telephone calls placed to <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION> today did not go through. A man answering the telephone at the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION> said `` everything is over'' when asked about the unrest in <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION>. The conversation was cut off before a reporter could ask the person's name and position. <ORGANIZATION> Baku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>, monitored by the London-based <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, reported today that two non-voting members of the national ruling Politburo, <PERSON> Georgy </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Razumovsky </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pyotr </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Demichev </PERSON>, had visited businesses and other establishments in <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION> to speak to the `` working people of these multinational collectives.'' It did not say when the tour occurred or say whether the two officials also went to <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION>. They had visited the Armenian capital, <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, last week during demonstrations there. Asked about reports that Soviet tanks are patrolling the streets of <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION>, that ethnic Azeris are attacking Armenians in the streets and that there have been at least two deaths in the city, <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> told the briefing, `` There is a curfew,'' but that he had not heard anything about tanks being sent into the city. Asked if troops remained in the city Tuesday, <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said: `` I do n't know, but I guess so. Presumably.'' The violence in <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION>, reported Monday by <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the official Soviet news agency, followed earlier outbreaks 150 miles away in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, the contested region in <LOCATION> Azerbaidzhan </LOCATION>, and massive but apparently peaceful demonstrations in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hovik </PERSON> <PERSON> Vassilian </PERSON> said in a telephone interview today that he and other Armenian activists were angry that the official media reported that the unrest had been quelled. He said he heard from travelers and from telephone calls to residents of the region that demonstrations were continuing in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> and that food was in short supply. The demonstrators demanded that <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, part of <LOCATION> Azerbaidzhan </LOCATION> since 1923, be made part of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. More than three-quarters of the region's population of 157,000 are ethnic Armenians. On Saturday, a Soviet prosecutor reported that two people living in a region of <LOCATION> Azerbaidzhan </LOCATION> that borders on <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> had been slain in unrest caused by the territorial dispute. On Friday, Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> appealed for restraint in <LOCATION> Azerbaidzhan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and promised that the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> would review relations among the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s more than 100 nationalities. Predominantly Moslem Azerbaidzhan is the largest of three Soviet republics in the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION>. It is bordered on the west by largely <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armenia </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and on the north by the <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Caspian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> runs for nearly 800 miles along its eastern edge.

<HEAD>Safety Agency Seeks Worm Probe Recall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal safety agency filed a civil complaint Wednesday seeking to force the recall of a device intended to help fishermen collect worms, but which it says could wind up electrocuting the anglers instead. The Consumer Product <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said it wants to halt sales of the WORM GETT' R made by <ORGANIZATION> P </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> M </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caldwell </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. Directory information showed no listing for <ORGANIZATION> P </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; M Enterprises in <LOCATION> Caldwell </LOCATION>. The device uses metal probes on wooden handles and is tied together by an electric wire, the commission said. When the probes are inserted into the ground, electric current passed through the wire drives worms to the surface. But the commission said the design exposes users to the bare metal charged with electricity and thus could lead to a dangerous shock. No injuries have been reported involving the device, but there have been 23 deaths since 1971 involving other brands of similarly designed worm probes, the agency reported. About 30,000 WORM GETT' R devices were sold nationally over the past five years at prices ranging from $ 8 to $ 30, the commission said. The commission asked that consumers who have been injured, or know of others who have had mishaps involving any type of worm probe, to call it at 1-800-638-2772.

 A man armed with two guns leaped out of a taxicab and opened fire on a crowded street today, wounding four people before being shot moments later, police said. Witnesses said the gunman got out of a taxicab after arguing with the driver of another vehicle and began firing repeatedly about a half-block from the Hyatt Regency Hotel, which is about five blocks from the <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION>. `` I saw there was a confrontation with the man in another vehicle. He pulled out a gun and started firing,'' said <PERSON> Tod </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarble </PERSON>, 20, who witnessed the 9 a.m. incident from a bus stop about 90 feet away. `` There were people all around the street who were trying to get up there when everybody was being shot, but I tried to keep them back,'' he said. A 55-year-old man believed to be the gunman was being treated at <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> for a gunshot wound to his left thigh, spokeswoman <PERSON> Inez </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisazadeh </PERSON> said. His condition was not known, she said. Another victim was being treated at <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> for a wound to her right knee, and another was treated at <ORGANIZATION> Brooke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> for multiple gunshot wounds. A third was taken to <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> with a leg wound, and the fourth to <LOCATION> Nix </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, also with a leg wound. After the initial shots, the gunman `` heard the sirens and began running. A downtown foot patrolman and a park ranger confronted him,'' police Sgt. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Buske </PERSON> said. `` The man apparently was out of shells in one of his guns, and was trying to reload while attempting to shoot with the other one,'' he said. `` The officers returned fire, and the man was struck in the upper leg.'' <PERSON> Buske </PERSON> said he did n't know whether bullets from the officers' guns or from the gunman's struck the man <PERSON> Tarble </PERSON> said that when the gunman, who was a passenger in the taxi, began firing, the taxi driver and the driver with whom the gunman had argued both tried run away. The gunman got out of the car, shot a passer-by in the leg, fired two shots at a woman trying to hunker down in her car's front seat and fired again at a passing station wagon, hitting the driver. He then went around a corner, shot at another person and was then felled by gunfire, <PERSON> Buske </PERSON> said.

 Doctors stopped treating patients and industry and construction halted today as a strike protesting the rule of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noreiga </PERSON> picked up support despite a violent crackdown on Tuesday. Most stores in the downtown commercial zone were open, but many outside the area closed. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a lawyer for a Panamanian opposition group said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was preparing to notify all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks where the Panamanian government has deposits not to engage in any transactions with the regime that seized power last week. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> action would require the banks to make payments only to the ambassador who represented the deposed government of President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> did not immediately confirm <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>' statement. On Tuesday, security agents armed with shotguns ransacked a radio station that defied censors by broadcasting news and backing the strike. A former presidential candidate also was roughed up. The raid by a score of state security agents shattered the uneasy calm that had marked the organized protest strike that began Monday to seek the ouster of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s military strongman. `` The station was totally destroyed,'' said the owner, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuniga </PERSON>, who ran unsuccessfully for president in 1984. `` It will return to the air when there is democracy in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.'' Many doctors appeared to have joined the strike today. Most of the main hospitals were staffing only their emergency rooms, a check of major hospitals and clinics showed. <PERSON> Zuniga </PERSON> was seen being arrested with his son, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON>, and two other people. Security agents pulled <PERSON> Zuniga </PERSON> by the hair, forced his head down and shoved him hard into a vehicle. His shirt was almost torn off as he struggled against the agents. The car was blocked by another vehicle and <PERSON> Zuniga </PERSON>, a white-haired man of about 60, fled down the street with his torn shirt fluttering and security men in pursuit. He was captured and later released and said he was unhurt. The other three were kicked, punched and beaten with truncheons. At least three people were wounded by birdshot, none seriously. Security agents confiscated the exposed film of several news photographers, including the <ORGANIZATION> Tampa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Allyn </PERSON> <PERSON> DiVito </PERSON>, who had a pistol held to his head until he surrendered his film. At a news conference following his release, <PERSON> Zuniga </PERSON> called the attack an `` act of official state gangsterism.'' He estimated damage to his station, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mundial </ORGANIZATION>, at $ 100,000. The station is also known as Radio 10-FM. Shortly before the attack, <PERSON> Zuniga </PERSON> said, the station broadcast an appeal to residents of the capital to demonstrate peacefully against the government by waving white hankerchiefs, honking their car horns and banging on pots and pans each day at noon and 6 p.m.. That was in defiance of government censors' orders that the station only play music About 15 people were handing out anti-government leaflets outside the station when the security agents arrived suddenly in four four-wheel drive vehicles with darkly tinted windows. The agents bolted from the vehicles, firing shotguns and revolvers in the air, quickly dispersed the leaflet distributors and charged into the station, smashing equipment and furniture. The station is housed in the offices of the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which <PERSON> Zuniga </PERSON> heads, and is in a middle-class neighborhood. At the first sounds of gunfire, about 150 neighbors poured into the street, many of them waving white banners and taunting the agents. Young men threw rocks at the security men and set up barricades of burning trash on the street outside the station and several sidestreets. Order was not restored for several hours. As word of the attack on Radio Mundial spread, barricades went up on streets elsewhere in the city, but there was no further violence. Leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crusade </ORGANIZATION>, a wide coalition of business, professional, labor and political groups that organized the nationwide strike, claimed Tuesday night that the action halted 85 percent of the country's economic activity. Crusade leaders said they would meet today to decide whether to continue the action. After <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s former second-in-command went public last June with charges the general was involved in vote fraud, corruption and political assassination, the Crusade organized several large demonstrations. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, chief of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s 17,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, sent troops into the streets with guns, billy clubs and tear gas to break up last summer's protests. Three people were killed and scores injured. Crusade leaders deny their goal is to restore <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> to the presidency. National Assembly ousted <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> on Friday for trying to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who has run the country since 1983, was indicted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last month for trafficking in Colombian cocaine. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> had said last Thursday that the general should step down while the charges were investigated. Until he tried to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> was widely seen as the general's puppet. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration says it still recognizes <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s presidency. Hours after he was dismissed, <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> went into hiding. He has not been seen publicly, but has issued statements calling for an international trade embargo against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to stop the cash flow.

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An extreme right-wing party opposing all concessions to blacks was favored today as voters began the process of filling two vacant seats in the white chamber of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was expected to win the seats in the districts of <LOCATION> Standerton </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Schweizer-Reneke </PERSON>, despite an aggressive campaign waged by President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s governing <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The turnout was expected to exceed 70 percent in both districts. More than 15,000 people were eligible to vote in Schweizer-Reneke and more than 22,000 in <LOCATION> Standerton </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> seeks to reinstate all rescinded apartheid laws and charges that <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> is capitulating to the country's 26 million black majority through his limited reforms in recent years. The Conservatives have been gaining ground in <LOCATION> Standerton </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Schweizer-Reneke </LOCATION>, rural districts in <LOCATION> Transvaal </LOCATION> province, at the expense of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. In Parliament's white chamber, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has firm control with 133 seats to 20 for the Conservatives. In last May's whites-only general election, the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> captured both the <LOCATION> Standerton </LOCATION> and Schweizer-Reneke seats, but they became vacant when the incumbents resigned. This by-election campaign illustrates the degree to which white politics has become a struggle on the right. The anti-apartheid <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> did not field candidates and demands of black activists and foreign critics are dismissed as irrelevant. `` The choice is between bad and worse,'' said Business Day, the leading financial daily. `` It may be an appalling thought, but the growing power of the extreme right is so serious a threat that we believe the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has to be opposed at every turn, even if it means voting for Nationalists.'' The Star of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> described Schweizer-Reneke as an area `` where blacks are seen and not heard. When they are seen it is largely in terms of service to whites.'' Both parties campaigned aggressively, revealing the widening rift among right-wing Afrikaners. Last year, the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> drew 26 percent of the vote nationwide and its support is growing, particularly in rural areas. It is favored to win another special election in <LOCATION> Transvaal </LOCATION> later this month. The <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has close links to the <ORGANIZATION> Afrikaner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, a paramilitary, white-supremacist group which is taking an increasingly confrontational stance against the government. Last Saturday, 5,000 movement members, many armed and wearing khaki uniforms, staged a boisterous rally in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> and then marched to government buildings with a petition demanding creation of a whites-only state. <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Andries </PERSON> <PERSON> Treurnicht </PERSON>, in a televised debate Monday, refused to repudiate the movement. <PERSON> Treurnicht </PERSON> told F.W. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister who heads the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Transvaal </LOCATION>: `` I defend the right of an organization to join me in resisting the dangerous course you are taking.'' The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, in power since 1948, says the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s goal of returning to strict apartheid is unrealistic. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> advocates limited power-sharing, with blacks gaining a say in national politics while whites retain control. Under apartheid, the white minority controls the country and keeps blacks in separate districts, schools and health services. Speaking last week in <LOCATION> Standerton </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> called for unity among Afrikaners _ who comprise 3 million of the country's 5 million whites _ and said the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> would protect white interests. `` We are not prepared to sell out <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to Marxist revolutionaries,'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said. `` We are prepared to fight for our country. `` Why are we -LRB- Afrikaners -RRB- cutting each others' throats when our enemy is waiting?'' he asked. In an hour-long speech before about 1,000 people, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> did not mention the government bans imposed last week that forbid political activity by 18 black opposition groups. Nor did he speak of any future race reforms. The Star said in an editorial Tuesday: `` To pacify right-wingers, the government has cracked down on black activists ... The Nationalists have abandoned any commitment to reform.'' Treurnicht spoke in <LOCATION> Standerton </LOCATION> the same night as <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, drawing a crowd of about 1,400. He said the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was capitulating to the 26 million black majority. `` When you share power you are no longer in control,'' Treurnicht said. `` We do n't want blacks in our Parliament and we do n't want to sit with them in theirs.'' <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> has separate chambers for whites, Asians and people of mixed race. Blacks are excluded. <PERSON> Treurnicht </PERSON> dismissed the recent crackdown as an election gimmick, saying it was too little, too late. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, meanwhile, said he was not a `` bad Afrikaner'' simply because he was willing to meet with `` reasonable'' black leaders. `` One has to be realistic,'' he said. `` This country consists not only of whites ... Is there a farmer who can produce without black labor? Is there an industrialist who can produce without black workers?''

<HEAD>Greenspan Says Entitlement Cuts May Be Best for Cutting Budget</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said today that deep cuts in `` entitlement'' programs, which include Social Security and Medicare, may be the most realistic way for cutting the federal budget deficit. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, testifying before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, also called for a 15-cent-a-gallon increase in the federal gasoline tax. But he said that, in general, tax increases do not appear to be a feasible way for trimming the budget shortfall, which was $ 150 billion last year. `` There are upside limits to the share of income that can be taxed,'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said. He also said he saw little opportunity for further major cuts in military spending, or in crucial federal programs such as the prison and air control system. That leaves little left for budget cuts beyond entitlement programs, which now make up about half of the federal budget. Entitlement programs are automatic-benefit social programs, in which increases are tied to the rate of inflation. `` Simple arithmetic points clearly to those areas where the scope for action is greatest,'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> testified. Even though trimming Social Security and other benefit programs would be politically difficult, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> told the panel that `` entitlement programs offer substantial opportunities for long-term budgetary savings.'' `` All the alternatives are known. The choices are political, not economic,'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> testified. He appeared as the panel considered President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s $ 1.09 trillion budget for the fiscal year that begins next Oct. 1 In other testimony, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said: _ Trade deficit improvements, led by higher import prices and surging exports, would continue even at current exchange-rate levels of the dollar _ There was some danger of increased inflation in the coming months from higher prices, but that these increases do `` not appear to be on the order of a magnitude that should cause concern.'' _ That `` there are no secret agreements'' among industrial nations involving interest rate levels in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that might be needed to support the goal of stabilizing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar at its current exchange-rate value.

<HEAD>Man Acquitted In Selling AIDS-Tainted Blood</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 An AIDS-stricken prostitute was acquitted today of two counts of attempted poisoning for selling his tainted blood to a blood bank. As the verdict was announced, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Markowski </PERSON>, a 29-year-old transient, rolled his eyes upward and nodded to his attorney, <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>. Jurors, who deliberated seven hours over two days, came to a decision Tuesday, but the verdict was sealed until today because <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> was unable to be in court. <PERSON> Markowski </PERSON> was charged with two counts of attempted poisoning for selling his blood for $ 10 to <ORGANIZATION> Plasma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Production </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> on June 22 and for trying to do so again June 25. He was arrested June 23 after screaming, `` Kill me! Kill me! I have AIDS!'' in a <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> bank while trying to grab a security guard's gun. When police arrested <PERSON> Markowski </PERSON>, they found the receipt for the plasma center. Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barreto </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said <PERSON> Markowski </PERSON> knew his blood could infect others but did n't care. But the defense said he had no intention of harming anyone. `` He made these donations for one reason and one reason only. He was broke and he was destitute and he was homeless and he was desperate,'' <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said. District Attorney <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Reiner </PERSON> originally charged <PERSON> Markowski </PERSON> with attempted murder. But Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Coen </PERSON> dismissed those counts, saying the law required a specific intent to kill that was not present in the case. <PERSON> Markowski </PERSON>, who has acknowledged being a homosexual prostitute, was tested positive for the presence of the deadly AIDS virus. He has appeared pale and emaciated during his trial.

<HEAD>Cuban Electorate Grows in Strength, Sophistication</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SANDRA WALEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Like many of his fellow Cuban-Americans, <PERSON> Agustin </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguero </PERSON> is Republican and staunchly anti-communist. The vice president and manager at <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Havana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Branch </ORGANIZATION> calls himself a moderate conservative and voted for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1980 and again in 1984. But <PERSON> Aguero </PERSON> is among the growing ranks of well-educated and politically sophisticated Cuban-Americans who will require more from presidential candidates than fierce anti-communist rhetoric. `` We Cubans are anti-communist, but that is n't our only goal,'' said <PERSON> Aguero </PERSON>, who left behind <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> 17 years ago. In the waning days before Super Tuesday, when 20 states including <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> will hold presidential primaries and caucuses, Cuban-Americans are weighing their options with a heavy tilt toward Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. More than two-thirds of the 165,274 Cuban-American voters registered in <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> are Republicans, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Dade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Since the 1984 presidential elections, the Republican party in <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> has added more than 42,000 Cuban-Americans to its rolls. In <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, the Cuban-American community, made up mostly of second-and third-generation <PERSON> Cubans </PERSON> and some who have been around since the turn of the century, tends to vote Democratic, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Hillsborough </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which keeps no record of the ethnic breakdown among parties. But the much larger and politically mobilized Cuban-American community in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> is clearly dominated by Republican fervor. Here, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appears to be the ticket for most Cuban-Americans. He has made regular forays here and has a strong organization headed by Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> and his son, <PERSON> Jeb </PERSON>, who is the state secretary of commerce. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> could conceivably capture about 70 percent of the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> vote, said <ORGANIZATION> Dade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salman </PERSON>. A recent poll of south <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Hispanics showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the choice of 81 percent, with the other <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidates far back in single digits. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> can not be counted out, however. He has made a serious pitch for the Cuban-American vote, criticized <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> as a `` butcher'' and his claim that there are <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> nuclear weapons in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> fell on receptive ears here. But the former television evangelist's recent anti-communist appeals apparently are n't being taken very seriously, and some say his impact on the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> vote will be negligible. `` I think the Cubans are very sophisticated ... They can see when people are saying things just to cater to them,'' said <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Suchlicki </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inter-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION>. `` They prefer truth and candor, not political sloganism.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s ties to the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration could hold negatives, <PERSON> Suchlicki </PERSON> said. `` There has been an enormous amount of disillusionment vis-a-vis <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' he said. As well, immigration policy also has been a sore point, with a reversal in the special treatment once accorded Cubans by the Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` There is definitely a great deal of disappointment,'' said <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, former president and founder of the <ORGANIZATION> Cuban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, `` with the way immigration -LRB- officials -RRB- and the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> are treating the Cubans from <LOCATION> Mariel </LOCATION> and ... the fact that -LRB- <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> -RRB- are talking constantly, even though <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> promised he would never deal with <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>.'' Foreign policy remains a top concern of Cuban-Americans, but increasingly they say their other interests are not being addressed, including but not limited to, issues such as the economy, housing and unemployment. <PERSON> Aguero </PERSON> said the new generation of Cubans, who do n't harbor notions of ever going back to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, simply have different ideals. They consider themselves Americans first and Cubans second, he said. <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said the number of Cuban-American Democrats is growing, and he said <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> should fare well among them. But most of the Cuban-American population still votes Republican. `` We feel the Republicans have done more for the things we like,'' <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> said. `` Since <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> we have not lost one country to communism. We also are interested in being able to have better lives, better jobs, low interest, low inflation and high employment. Republicans do this more often and better than the Democrats.''

<TEXT>
 A mutiny broke out on among usually meek and patient <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> commuters, with passengers refusing orders to leave their delay-plagued subway train until its driver took them to their destination. Only about a dozen rebellious passengers were involved in the Tuesday night incident on the `` tube,'' as the subway system is known, but <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> said it was unprecedented, given the meek and humble nature of the British commuter. To the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evening </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, it was `` The Great Tube Revolt,'' and the mutineers' unidentified leader was `` a superhero in the <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> mold _ quiet, mild-mannered and unassuming.'' The excitement generated by the incident reflected not only the frustrations of riding the system's aging Northern Line, but the amazement of Londoners at the prospect of British commuters abandoning their fabled reserve and making a public fuss. A similar incident occurred in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s subway system in April 1985, when about a dozen commuters refused to leave a disabled train until they were taken from it by transit police. <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> accused the tube mutineers of being selfish. Spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said the problem began with delays caused by a signal failure. Passengers bound for High Barnet, at the end of the Northern Line, were told to disembark five stations before their destination and wait for the next train. They started filing off, but then, according to the Standard, a `` mild-looking and well-dressed'' passenger declared: `` I've had enough. I'm staying put. If we all do it, they'll have to take the train on.'' About a dozen passengers got back into the train, it said. More passengers followed, and after hurried consultations the staff bowed to the pressure and sent the train on. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said that had the passengers done as they were told, the next train would have taken them to High Barnet, while the first train could have turned back to collect passengers in central <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> who had been delayed by the earlier signal failure. `` We had an overall picture of what was happening,'' he told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` Those passengers had only a narrow and selfish view and put their needs above others.'' Passenger <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Golding </PERSON> of High Barnet was quoted by the Standard as saying the mutineers were cheering and laughing, because `` we knew that if everyone did it _ and stayed put _ there was n't anything they could do about it.'' Another passenger, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Gama </PERSON>, was quoted as saying: `` Everybody was just totally fed up. The waiting room was freezing and nobody could tell us why the train was stopping where it did. But when everybody climbed back on, it was a marvelous moment.'' The Northern Line, parts of which are more than a century old, carries 700,000 passengers a day and serves 50 stations between south and north <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Dubbed `` The Misery Line'' by newspapers, it is attacked for defective trains and equipment, last-minute schedule changes, signal failures and dirty stations. It is to have a major modernization in the 1990s. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> denied the line was worse than others but conceded that some employees can be rude. `` They know what they're up against and they probably do n't look forward to coming to work any more than passengers look forward to using the line,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 By putting new emphasis on the threat to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> from Soviet tanks and troops, Western leaders hope to blunt <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s drive to capitalize on splits within <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> on nuclear arms strategy. In a joint statement Wednesday, leaders of the Western alliance called on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and its allies to begin negotiations aimed at eliminating the East's capability for launching a surprise attack in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. They said Soviet non-nuclear forces facing <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> are far in excess of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s needs for self defense and `` cast a shadow over the whole of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> called the declaration `` a major step forward for the alliance.'' The idea is to portray the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> as united in calling for fewer non-nuclear weapons at a time when the alliance members can not agree how far to go in scrapping atomic arms. The <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> initiative also shifts the public spotlight away from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s dispute within the alliance over whether and when to replace very short-range nuclear weapons with new, more effective ones. Most of these weapons, if used, would strike German soil, East or West. The main <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> theme is that the Soviet-led <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION>'s numerical superiority in conventional weapons and troops _ not the existence of nuclear arms in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> _ is the greatest danger to Western security According to Western estimates, the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact holds about a 3-to-1 advantage in tanks and artillery and nearly a 2-to-1 edge in combat aircraft and troops, including reserves in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> contends that East-West conventional forces are roughly equivalent. The stress on conventional arms, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> hopes, will steal some of the momentum from Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s campaign to woo the <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> public with calls for ridding their continent of all nuclear weapons. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders agree that some nuclear arms are needed in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to deter attack. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> appears to have significantly improved his public image in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> by agreeing last year to a longstanding <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal to eliminate all intermediate-range nuclear weapons, based mostly in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The 16 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nations have strongly endorsed this deal, known as the INF Treaty. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is expected to ratify the treaty this spring. But in the aftermath of the INF deal, the alliance has fallen into disagreement over whether to press immediately for <LOCATION> East-West </LOCATION> negotiations to reduce a large Soviet edge in short-range nuclear missiles. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which is most directly threatened by these weapons, wants such talks to start soon; most of the other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies do not. The <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit was not expected to discuss this quandry in detail, much less find a solution. Instead, a key aim of the meeting was to turn the public's attention to other aspects of East-West relations, including human rights and non-nuclear arms talks. The <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> members and the seven <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nations have been working for a year to agree on the framework for a new set of negotiations to establish a more stable balance of conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. These talks, likely to begin this fall, would replace a narrower set of East-West negotiations on cutting troop levels, which began in 1973. After 15 years, these talks have not produced a single agreement. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> members hope the new negotiations would focus more directly on warfighting equipment as well as troops. These talks also would encompass the full European area, from the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Ural </LOCATION> mountains. The old troop talks were limited to the central front. Even though the Western allies acknowledge that it may take years to reach a meaningful agreement on conventional forces, they hope the drive to reach the bargaining table will put <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> back on the diplomatic offensive.

 Children at a Hare Krishna commune have been subjected to sexual abuse and forced into communal marriages, according a court petition filed by a former sect member seeking custody of her children. The petition was filed with the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which gave no immediate answer Tuesday to the appeal by <PERSON> Christina </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>, a former <PERSON> Hare </PERSON> <PERSON> Krishna </PERSON> member who claims her children are in danger at the religious sect's <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> commune. <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> alleges that New Vrindaban, the nation's largest <PERSON> Krishna </PERSON> community, is fraught with polygamy, child molestation and sexual abuse, her lawyer told the court Tuesday. <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>, now a legal secretary in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, is asking the high court to remove her three children, ages 2, 3 and 6, from their father's care at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vrindaban </LOCATION>. `` These children have no protection today but in this court,'' lawyer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Gold </PERSON> told justices. The northern <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> community is the target of several federal and state investigations. A family law master had ruled that the children were in jeopardy at the commune, but a circuit judge stayed that order at the request of the children's father, <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorrick </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> is appealing that stay. <PERSON> Gorrick </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lees </PERSON>, said the family law master has issued a gag order on the case and he could not discuss it. Members of the commune have faced criminal charges, including murder and manslaughter charges against fringe members of the commune, and child molestation charges against two former commune teachers. The sect's leader, <PERSON> Kirtanananda </PERSON> <PERSON> Swami </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhaktipada </PERSON>, recently was found innocent of arson charges, although another commune member was convicted in the case. The Krishnas have denied any wrongdoing and have accused authorities of harassment. <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>' petitions make a broad range of allegations against the <PERSON> Krishna </PERSON> community. <PERSON> Gorrick </PERSON> `` has been simultaneously ` married' to the petitioner and other women, said marriages being ordered by the swami,'' according to the petition. Children at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vrindaban </LOCATION> `` have been subject to sexual abuse by the very teachers entrusted with their safety and well-being. Said abuse includes the repeated and systematic oral and anal homosexual rape of school children at said school by the headmaster,'' according to the court petition. `` Parents who have confronted the swami about said sexual abuse have been advised by said swami that, ` sex is sex,''' the petition states. `` Authorities at -LRB- New Vrindaban -RRB- regularly contribute to the delinquency of minors, by forcing girls ... to drop out of school and marry ... as young as the age of 12 years,'' the petition states. <PERSON> Gorrick </PERSON>, whom <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> calls the commune's chief fund-raiser, `` has directly caused or contributed'' to the alleged practice of using commune children as young as 11 to solicit donations, according to the petition.

 A juvenile court judge ordered a psychiatric evaluation for a 13-year-old boy who chopped off his uncle's hand at the uncle's request. Juvenile Judge <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said Tuesday that the youth was charged with mayhem, the crime of cutting off a body part of another, after he chopped off his uncle's hand Sunday at the man's home in <LOCATION> Lakeland </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shelby </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspector </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Buck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wood </ORGANIZATION> said the uncle, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Veazey </PERSON>, 33, had a history of treatment for mental problems. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said the man told his nephew he had rabies in the hand and asked him to chop it off. Sgt. <PERSON> Travis </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said the youth had said <PERSON> Veazey </PERSON> had repeatedly asked him to cut off the hand. `` I got tired of listening to it and got on with it,'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> quoted the youth as saying. The boy used a single-blade ax to cut off the hand and then threw it into a garbage can, retrieving the hand only when a neighbor doubted his tale of cutting it off. <PERSON> Veazey </PERSON> had prepared a bucket of hydrogen peroxide and water to treat the stump of his arm, <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said.

 <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> on Wednesday returned to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> what are believed to be remains of 17 American servicemen missing in action in the Vietnam War, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said. The Vietnamese also turned over written reports on three other missing Americans, said Lt. Col. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Mather </PERSON>, leader of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military team that received the remains in a ceremony at <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Noi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> The return was the largest in two years and the fourth largest since the war ended in April 1975 with a communist victory over the U.S.-backed South <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> government. The largest return was in August 1985, when 26 sets of remains were returned. <PERSON> Mather </PERSON> said some of the remains received Wednesday involved cases of highest priority to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mather </PERSON> said a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> honor guard saluted under chilly, overcast skies as the metal caskets of remains, each draped with a folded <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag, were loaded onto a C-141 transport plane for the flight to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. The names attached to the remains were not released. They will be analyzed there by the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Identification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> to see if they belong to any of the nearly 1,800 Americans listed as missing in action from the Vietnam War. <PERSON> Mather </PERSON> said some of the names that the Vietnamese provided, along with the remains and written reports, are among a list of 70 that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> considers of highest priority. Retired Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON>, acting as a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidential emissary, handed over the list of names during a mission to <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> in August. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says that in these `` discrepancy cases,'' there is compelling evidence that Vietnamese authorities at some level know what happened to the missing men. Evidence includes photographs of captured Americans who never emerged from prisoner of war camps. <PERSON> Mather </PERSON> said the remains were mostly of airmen. Most missing airmen were shot down during bombing missions in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. The Vietnamese told Mather they would start the next round of `` technical talks'' on MIAs on March 12. During these talks, which <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> has agreed to hold six times annually, experts of both sides discuss ways of retreiving remains, locating warplane crash sites and related issues. Wednesday's turnover was the third since <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> agreed during <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON>'s visit to break a deadlock and resume efforts to account for American MIAs. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> pledged then to look into <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s own humanitarian problems. An official <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> medical team flew to <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> on Wednesday to continue that mission, said the spokesman of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Petzing </PERSON>. Three previous medical teams have studied the plight of disabled war veterans and other humanitarian cases and made recommendations on how private <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> charitable organizations can aid rehabilitation programs. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has encouraged private assistance but refused Vietnamese requests for direct <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government aid. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has withheld diplomatic recognition and official aid to protest <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s military occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>.

 The 3 -LCB- - year-old girl who received five organs in a landmark transplant operation is progressing `` with no major bumps'' in her recovery four months after the surgery, hospital officials said Wednesday <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, from <LOCATION> Madisonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, was reported still in serious condition in a private room of Children's Hospital of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON> underwent surgery ending Nov. 1 to replace her liver, pancreas, small intestine and parts of her stomach and colon. She suffered from short gut syndrome, a congenital defect, and would have died without the transplant, according to doctors. `` Her recovery has really been somewhat uneventful,'' said hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> McMahon </PERSON>. `` She is really progressing fine. There have been no major bumps along the way.'' <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON> is still being fed intravenously, through a special pump to her stomach, and by mouth with a special baby food formula, according to Miss <PERSON> McMahon </PERSON>. The girl has never eaten solid food. <PERSON> Tabatha </PERSON>'s surgeons said they have no precedent for feeding such a patient. Two other patients underwent similar operations in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in recent years, but they died within a few days. Her mother, <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON>, is at her bedside daily, Miss <PERSON> McMahon </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Judge Uses Reading And Library Time As Part of Juvenile Probation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A judge who orders some juvenile offenders to go to the library and read as a condition of probation says he harbors no illusions that it will help everyone. He'd settle for one out of four. `` I understand that a good number of young people will laugh at this,'' Baltimore Circuit Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrnes </PERSON> said in a recent interview. `` Some will try, but will fall by the wayside when they get back in with their buddies in their environment. And others simply wo n't be able, intellectually. `` But I'm convinced that a significant minority, once coerced into reading, will be so attracted by the experience that it will change their lives. I'm optimistic that we can do it. If we can reach 25 percent of the youthful offenders we see, I'd call this plan a roaring success.'' The judge, who splits his time between juvenile court and the city's <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, said he has made reading a part of probation since he came on the bench about five years ago. An ad hoc committee of librarians, educators and parole and probation officers was formed a year ago and hopes to have a formal list of suitable titles, basically from the junior high school level, by the end of the year. Some of the suggested titles include `` I Am The Darker Brother'' by <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Adoff </PERSON>, `` Westmark'' by <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, `` <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> To The Infinite Power'' by <PERSON> Mildred </PERSON> <PERSON> Ames </PERSON>, `` Curse of the Blue Figurine'' by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellairs </PERSON>, `` Sounder'' by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, and `` Are You There God? It's Me, <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON>'' by <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Blum </PERSON>. <PERSON> Byrnes </PERSON> also said he has restricted television viewing as a condition of probation in some cases. `` It's interesting _ no matter what you say before that, they shudder when I come to the one about television,'' he said.

 <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> the ferret was scheduled for execution this week, but a public outcry resulted in a pardon from the mayor. `` We are going to ferret out a solution,'' said Farmers Branch Mayor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, who spared the animal Monday. The fuzzy, pink-eyed ferret was caged at the city's animal shelter. Farmers Branch police Officer <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> spotted the animal Friday during patrol. When he opened the door of his car and whistled, the ferret jumped into his lap and snuggled against him. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> took the ferret to the animal shelter in the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> suburb and attached a note to his cage that said, `` Please do not destroy. If no one claims it, I want it back.'' Because of a city ordinance prohibiting exotic animals, officials said the ferret would be destroyed if his owner was not found. As news spread of the ferret's plight, the animal shelter was deluged with requests to adopt the creature. Animal control officer <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Worsham </PERSON> said his department could not take responsibility for placing <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> for adoption because there is no approved vaccine for ferrets and the animals sometimes bite. But <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> promised Monday to `` cut through the red tape.'' The mayor said he spoke to the owner of an animal rehabilitation center about taking the animal. The center has a state license to keep wild animals, which will prevent the ferret's death. `` He's got a reprieve,'' <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> announced today its board had accepted a multibillion-dollar acquisition bid by <ORGANIZATION> R.H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> over a competing offer from <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION> But <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> refused to give up its quest for <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>, the nation's fifth-largest retailer. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> signed a definitive agreement to create a new company, <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> - <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Fingeroth </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION>, which has nearly 100 department and The agreement provides for <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> to begin a cash tender offer of $ 74.50 a share for about 80 percent of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s 89.6 million outstanding shares, or a total of $ 5.25 billion, <PERSON> Fingeroth </PERSON> said. The remaining <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> shares would be exchanged for stock in the new company. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> had offered $ 68 a share in cash for all Federated shares, or $ 6.1 billion. After the agreement was announced, <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> said it would proceed with a $ 66 cash tender offer for <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>. `` Macy's bid is not competitive and we intend to prevail in the marketplace,'' a <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> statement said. `` It is now up to <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s shareholders to decide.'' Trading in Federated stock was halted on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> prior to the <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> announcement. After trading resumed, its stock rose 50 cents per share to $ 67.50. <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> bid came to light Monday as <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> directors met to consider whether to accept the <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> offer. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> began its bid Jan. 25, offering $ 47 a share. The bid was rejected as inadequate, and <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> sweetened the offer several times before arriving at the $ 68 bid. Late last week, <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> officials decided to negotiate an agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>, and the Toronto-based developer's offer was still on the table as the Macy bid was considered. <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> originally offered $ 73.80 per share and then increased its bid before the agreement was signed. Wall Street analysts said Tuesday the rival bids were attractive for different reasons. `` Campeau is sitting there with cash, and <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION>'s walked in the door with some cash but the opportunity for the company to enjoy future growth _ as opposed to <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s potential breaking up or dismantling of the company,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Tashjian </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Seidler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amdec </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. He referred to the fact that <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> sold off most of <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s divisions after he bought the company in December 1986. New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION>, which is privately held, is the nation's 10-largest retailer A Federated acquisition represents for <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> a chance to control some of its major competitors, such as <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s, and to increase its market share at the same time, said <PERSON> Michele </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, of the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Oppenheimer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` They can position <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s at one price point and <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> at another price point such that they do n't compete head on with each other,'' she said The deal also would give <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> more outlets for its extensive line of private label merchandise, said <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenstein </PERSON>, of the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Inc.. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> was fighting for <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> because it does not want to lose the opportunity to gain the foothold into major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shopping centers that <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> stores would provide, <PERSON> Greenstein </PERSON> Moreover, that entree could go instead to <PERSON> Macy </PERSON> board member <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Taubman </PERSON>, himself a shopping mall developer, <PERSON> Greenstein </PERSON> said. The agreement between <PERSON> Macy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> called for the new company's board to include significant representation from the existing <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> board. <PERSON> Macy </PERSON>, one of the nation's biggest and best-known retailers, was taken private by a management group in a $ 3.6 billion leveraged buyout in 1986. Its stores rang up $ 5.21 billion in sales during the fiscal year ended Aug. 1. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> took in $ 11 billion last year from its more than 650 department stores, supermarkets and other outlets nationwide, including <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s, <ORGANIZATION> Abraham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Straus </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Filene </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Burdine </PERSON>'s, <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bullock </PERSON>'s and <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>'s department stores; Gold Circle discount stores and <ORGANIZATION> Ralphs </ORGANIZATION> supermarkets. In December 1986, <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> acquired giant <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION>, whose operations still include the <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marsh </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>'s and <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> chains.

<HEAD>Judge Rules Graham's Confession Admissible in Bodies Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A judge today ruled the confession by a man to the slayings of seven women in his apartment could be admitted at trial and rejected a claim of illegal arrest. Common Pleas Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Latrone </PERSON> denied a defense motion to suppress the confession and all physical evidence seized by police in <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>'s home last August. Defense attorney <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Moldovsky </PERSON> also had sought to have <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>'s arrest declared illegal. <PERSON> Latrone </PERSON> said the validity of the statement will be up to the jury. <PERSON> Moldovsky </PERSON> and Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> then met with Latrone to discuss the start of jury selection. No date was immediately set. The ruling ended a 14-day pretrial hearing for <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, accused of killing seven women after luring them to his apartment with liquor and drugs. Police found human remains in and near <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>'s apartment <PERSON> Moldovsky </PERSON> is mounting an insanity defense for his client. He claims <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> has three personalities: <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, a foul-mouthed junkie who kills women during sex; <PERSON> Marty </PERSON>, an easy-going, mother-worshiping guy who confessed to the murders; and <PERSON> Junior </PERSON>, a mute, bad-mannered 2-year-old who and likes cartoon characters. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>'s full name is <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. <PERSON> Moldovsky </PERSON> last week asked for new psychiatric evaluations of <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> when the suspect described how he punched another inmate during a fight at the Detention Center `` <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> did it,'' said <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, describing to Latrone how he responded to an inmate who had kicked him. King has dismissed the multiple-personality claim as `` just smoke.'' He says <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> is a shrewd, street-smart faker who deserves the electric chair.

<HEAD>King Fahd Inaugurates Largest Free-Span Stadium</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 King Fahd on Wednesday inaugurated the King Fahd International Stadium, the largest free-span structure in the world. The official opening of the stadium coincided with the ninth Gulf Cup Soccer Championships in which seven teams from Arab countries are participating. In a ceremonial message, <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fahd </ORGANIZATION> said `` this is eloquent proof of the progress which this country has made in all fields.'' There have been hints in the pro-government media that the kingdom would like to be a host for the Olympic Games. The multimillion-dollar stadium can accommodate 75,000 spectators, with the design owing something to the traditional shape of a bedouin tent but merged with the most advanced engineering technology. The exterior of the stadium is in the shape of a circle with a diamater of 290 yards. The bowl contains the playing field with natural grass, imported from <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, the 400-yard running track, the long jump pits, pole vaulting area and javelin throw run. The roof membrane is stretched between 24 tent-shaped peaks, each supported by a 60-yard vertical mast. The covering is a Teflon-coated fabric. The royal and VIP pavilion, with six floors of exclusively furnished rooms for royal receptions, seats 750. The grass is watered from a 15-inch-deep water underground reservoir.

<HEAD>Bombs, Fires as Opposition Begins Anti-Election Strike</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Bands of youths hurled bombs, burned cars and trucks, and shouted anti-government slogans Wednesday during a general strike called to disrupt Parliamentary elections. At least eight people were injured. Teen-agers and children, several appearing younger than 10 years old, stopped a city garbage truck in downtown <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, smashed it with clubs and set it ablaze. `` We set fire to <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>'s throne!'' the youngsters chanted, referring to President <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>. Demonstrators stoned and taunted police burned election banners, along with at least one scooter and a taxi. The opposition called the strike to protest Thursday's Parliamentary elections Many here believe the elections have more potential for violence than for halting the stalemate between <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> and his foes. Eight people were reported hospitalized with injuries from small bombs, and two were in serious condition, police and hospital officials said. But no major confrontations erupted between police and protestors, and the city was calm overall. In the southern port city of <LOCATION> Chittagong </LOCATION>, witnesses said at least 50 people were injured in clashes between protestors and police. The witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said protestors threw bombs at the office of the local municipal corporation and damaged several vehicles. In the capital, the strike appeared successful, shutting down shops and businesses and chasing from the streets the bicycle rickshaws that make <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> traffic a nightmare. But the strike appeared to have little effect outside <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> other than stopping trucks and buses from running. It was the 24th strike called by the opposition since Nov. 10, when it began its campaign to oust <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>. In a move to compromise with his opponents, <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> dissolved the 330-seat <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> last December, 3 -LCB- years before its term was to expire, and scheduled new elections. But opposition leaders have said no election conducted under <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> can be fair, and they are urging a voter boycott. At least 33 people have been died since Nov. 10, either in clashes, by police gunfire, or in campaign-related violence. <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasina </PERSON> of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Awami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that she expected only 5 percent or 10 percent of the 47.8 million voters to cast ballots. More than 900 candidates from 102 political parties are running for <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. Eighteen candidates, all from <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Jatiya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, have already been declared elected for lack of opposition, and voting in one district was canceled because of the slaying of a candidate. In addition to the Parliamentary election, municipal elections will be held in the cities of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chittagong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Khulna </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Rajshahi </LOCATION>. In similar polling for town and village councils across the country three weeks ago, more than 100 people were killed in battles between supporters of candidates. <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> seized power in a bloodless coup in 1982 and won election in 1986. He ordered 9,000 army troops and about 290,000 local police and paramilitary troops deployed to ensure security for the elections.

 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is preparing to notify all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks where the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> government has deposits not to engage in any transactions with the regime that seized power in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> last week, a lawyer for a Panamanian opposition group said today. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, an attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Arnold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> law firm, said the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> government is believed to have deposits in five <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks and that law suits are being drawn up to ensure bank compliance with the measure. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> told a news conference the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> action would require the banks to make disbursements only to the ambassador who represented the deposed government of President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>. Later, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> deputy spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said the department was preparing documentation certifying that persons designated by <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> are the legitimate representatives of the Panamanian government. But she did not say what the legal consequences of the certification were or why it was being prepared. Ambassador <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON>, who has maintained that <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s ouster was unconstitutional, said he had no precise figures on the amounts of money in the Panamanian accounts but estimated the number to be $ 50 million In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, lawyers for <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> sued in federal court today to block a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> bank from turning over millions of dollars to new government in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order, blocking the <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> from transferring an estimated $ 10 million. A hearing on the matter is slated for Monday before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> McMahon </PERSON>. The lawsuit seeks to establish title to the funds held in the <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> account and `` to prevent their transfer into the hands of a military dictatorship ... which has attempted to seize power and overthrow the lawful authorities of the Republic of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' according to court papers. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is seriously considering withholding from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> the next payment on the fees the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> gives <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> for use of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. He estimated that figure at $ 8 million. Ms. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> confirmed that a request from the <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> government to put the funds in escrow had been received and that the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was consulting with other agencies on how to proceed. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> fired military strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> last Thursday but the defense chief ignored the order and rallied his allies in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> against the president. On Friday, the assembly voted to oust <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> and installed Education Minister <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> in his place. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has been indicted on drug smuggling charges by two <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> grand juries and has been under heavy diplomatic, economic and political pressure by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to step aside and open the way for civilian-led constitutional rule. Among the banks listed by <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> which would be affected by the order are <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Trust </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. He said all have headquarters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Every dime we can find is in those banks,'' <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said. He added that any bank which ignores the order could be liable for whatever payments it makes to the current Panamanian government. The coalition of opposition leaders believes that the Panamanian government is facing a grave cash flow problem and is extremely vulnerable to economic pressure from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Unlike other countries, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> can not cover its cash shortages by printing new money because the dollar is the national currency. <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> said international opposition to the new government was evident earlier this week when, he claimed, only eight ambassadors showed up for a State of the Union address. From the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>, he said, only <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> attended.

 Driving through the streets of this diplomatic capital, one would never guess that the leaders of the Western world are in town to chart the future course of the NAT0 alliance. But then, <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> tends to take its summits in stride. There are no banners, no curious onlookers and few flags to bear witness to the presence of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and 15 other government leaders for the two-day <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit that began Wednesday. Except for occasional motorcycle escorts leading official limousines on a weaving course through traffic, the city's normal routine has not been disrupted noticeably. Security is tightest for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who is staying in the 19th century Chateau Stuyvenberg on the outskirts of the city, next to the Royal Palace. The chateau's wooded grounds are patrolled by guard dogs and mounted police. `` It is a fortress,'' said one police official, who spoke only on condition that he not be identified. `` Everything is tiptop in order.'' <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> is a stolid, middle-class city that for decades has played host to the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, several offices of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and numerous international lobbying groups. Strict security for highly placed officials is a routine and unobtrusive element in this city of about 1 million people. <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> handled its last summit, for the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>, only three weeks ago. The pace of the city is geared toward international meetings. Taxi drivers ask their customers whether they prefer a normal or a fast trip out to the sprawling <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in the quiet suburb of <LOCATION> Evere </LOCATION>. The only sign of summit-induced chaos was seen Wednesday at the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> press center, where an estimated 2,000 journalists jostled each other for copies of official statements, draft beer and interviews with the few official sources willing to brave the crush. Reflecting the Belgian taste for good living, beer began to flow from the press center taps at about 11 a.m.. A minor incident occurred when a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> security agent tried to grab a microphone from an American television network crew member while the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders posed for a group photograph A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> security agent accompanying <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> stepped in with the admonition, `` Do not manhandle journalists,'' and the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> agent backed off. Police spokesman <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Devaux </PERSON> said 500 uniformed Belgian policemen were working around the clock `` with uncommon vigilance'' to protect every <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leader. A <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> newspaper said they were being reinforced by about 500 state security force personnel. Days before the summit opened Wednesday, police guards were reinforced and additional metal detectors were installed at <LOCATION> Zaventem </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. Areas where summit leaders were to arrive were swept repeatedly for explosives, but none was found. The summiteers, who brought their own security forces along, were staying in hotels and embassies scattered throughout the city. Overall security was being coordinated at a command center in the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. Police detained 20 anti-nuclear protesters for identity checks after they tried to demonstrate outside <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> headquarters without a police permit.

 The government said Wednesday it wo n't release a recording of the conversation between a control tower and a South African Airways jumbo jet that crashed Nov. 28 in the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, killing all 159 people aboard. The announcement was made by <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Margo </PERSON>, head of an international board that began meeting Monday to investigate the cause of the crash on a flight from <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 went down minutes before it was due to refuel in <LOCATION> Mauritius </LOCATION>. Reports at the time had quoted Mauritian officials as saying the pilot reported fire or smoke in the cockpit. South African officials took over the investigation from Mauritian aviation authorities, and no further information was released. The South African officials said at the time that quotes from the recording would not be released because they might be misunderstood and some people might believe they were being accused or blamed. <PERSON> Margo </PERSON> said the recorded conversation was indistinct in parts and experts had disagreed about what was said, so no official transcript or sound from the recording would be released. <PERSON> Margo </PERSON> said the board had decided Wednesday that the cockpit voice recorder, flight data recorder and other pieces of the jet must be recovered `` at all costs'' from the crash site 14,520 feet under the ocean north of <LOCATION> Mauritius </LOCATION>. Aboard the jet were 71 South Africans, 47 Japanese, 30 Taiwanese, and one or two passengers from <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mauritius </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>.

With this latest scandal, the tendency among much of the public may be to condemn all radio and television religious ministries. That would be understandable, but it also would be a mistake.

Ask them a technical question about the 1986 tax law changes that go into effect this year. What's the `` jeopardy'' part? Well, one fourth of the time the answer will be wrong. ... But if you rely on that answer when you file your return, and underpay your tax as a result, you're still subject to a penalty and interest for underpaying. A year ago ... the new tax witholding forms ... turned out to be so arcane that the -LRB- IRS -RRB- had to waive deadlines and develop new forms. It's hard to figure out how a law that was so widely understood and welcomed _ as an effort to make the tax code more fair, logical and efficient _ could have spawned such confusion.

 Feb. 28 The <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> -RRB- Register on the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> parody decision: When the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> hands down a unanimous decision, you might figure it was a cut-and-dried case. Not so with last week's decision upholding Hustler magazine's disgusting parody of the Rev <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>. While the court seemed to grant almost absolute protection to speech that is intended as satire, it left blurred the line that distinguishes fact from fiction, parody from portrayal. At issue was a 1983 takeoff of a well-known liquor advertisement in which famous people describe the `` first time'' they tasted the product. In Hustler's version, <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> was depicted as having sex with his mother in an outhouse. Outraged, the televangelist and founder of the Moral Majority sued publisher <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynt </PERSON> for $ 45 million for libel, invasion of privacy and infliction of emotional distress. A lower court had no trouble discerning that the parody was fiction. Thus <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> did not have a case for libel. ... But it awarded him $ 200,000 for emotional distress. It took the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to rule that awards for emotional distress require ... -LRB- proof of -RRB- factual falsehood, the standard for libel. ... And now the court rules draw a distinction between satire, which is absolutely free, and seriousness, which is not. Free speech should mean just that. ... In the marketplace of ideas and public opinion, truth almost always will win out.

The only remarkable thing about the <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> case is the extent to which everyone is focusing on his physical sin, that of consorting with a prostitute.

Amid all this glorious healing, it seems almost unkind to note that <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> did not admit his sin until he had no choice _ until it was reported by a fellow TV evangelist and competitor whom <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> had helped discredit and drive out of business.

There is no question the parody was putrid. It also was painful for Moral Majority founder <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>. Still, to condemn it because it breaks all boundaries for sleaze is one thing. To rule it is libelous is another. If a public figure can not prove he has been libeled, he ca n't recover damages for even the most extreme embarrassment In this case, that would have meant proving the parody contained statements known by the author to be false, which could be considered true.

It may point to some extra efforts if the average fluctuates greatly from one year to the next. But it is not universally taken and thus there are too many other factors involved in assessing the quality of education which those tests can not depict.

The pill does not have <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> approval. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>.

 Like <PERSON> Rip </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Winkle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tarrytown </LOCATION> has been asleep to its heritage for years, and will awaken to a new and better life if its name is changed to <ORGANIZATION> Sleepy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hollow </ORGANIZATION>, some residents say. `` It's a part of history that we're Sleepy Hollow,'' said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Skelly </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Village </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sleepy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hollow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's not a made-up name It gives us the potential to be famous because everyone's heard of Sleepy Hollow.'' In the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Irving story, <LOCATION> Sleepy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hollow </LOCATION> was the town where the Headless Horseman rode. <PERSON> Rip </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Winkle </PERSON>, another Irving character, slept for 20 years in the Catskills. <PERSON> Skelly </PERSON> said <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>, for whom nearby <LOCATION> Irvington </LOCATION> was named, did n't make up the name, but reached back to 17th century Dutch descriptions of the area as `` slaeperingh haven'' and `` slaeperingh hol,'' or sleeping harbor and sleepy hollow The names meant it was easy to dock there and spend the night. Now, <PERSON> Skelly </PERSON> and others want to bring the Dutch name back to distinguish <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tarrytown </LOCATION> from neighboring <LOCATION> Tarrytown </LOCATION> and try to revitalize the village of 8,000 beset by financial and social woes. Residents will decide the matter during village elections March 15. Opponents of the measure, such as <PERSON> Edna </PERSON> <PERSON> Belanich </PERSON>, a founder of Concerned Citizens Against Changing the Name of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tarrytown </LOCATION>, say it would be confusing and costly and would n't accomplish anything. `` It'll be a panacea, not a cure,'' she said. `` History will not pay the bills or solve the problems. We can keep history in our hearts.'' <PERSON> Skelly </PERSON> says history can go a long way to attracting new business, particularly tourism, to the village, which boasts the Sleepy Hollow cemetery, an old <LOCATION> Dutch </LOCATION> graveyard, and <LOCATION> Philipsburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Manor </LOCATION>, the home of an early English settler. `` We are not a suburb of <LOCATION> Tarrytown </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` We're in different towns. We have different histories. We are the older, more historic village and the name should reflect that.'' A report done by Mayor <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandolfo </PERSON> estimated the cost of the name change to range as high as almost $ 40,000, including a new seal, new badges for police and firefighters and new administrative costs. But Mrs. <PERSON> Belanich </PERSON> said the cost would be higher because it was difficult to determine hidden expenses. `` And it's not necessary,'' she said. `` They think changing the name will solve our financial problems and the social problems. They just do n't want to be associated with them.'' The village suffered a major racial disturbance in 1986 when problems in the Hispanic community brought in officers from several neighboring communities and led to a countywide evaluation of Hispanic problems. Financially, the village has been running in the red since it agreed to lower the property tax assessment for the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> plant, which had threatened to sue. Originally called <LOCATION> Beekmantown </LOCATION>, the village became <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tarrytown </LOCATION> in 1874, three years after <LOCATION> Tarrytown </LOCATION> was incorporated. <PERSON> Skelly </PERSON> said <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tarrytown </LOCATION> felt threatened by the town of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pleasant </LOCATION>, so it aligned itself with <LOCATION> Tarrytown </LOCATION>. `` Now we're just <LOCATION> Tarrytown </LOCATION>'s poor relation. We do n't get enough attention and we deserve it because we're world-famous,'' said <PERSON> Skelly </PERSON>. `` It's a very powerful name and image. It's a potential gold mine.''

<HEAD>New Home Sales Down 9 Percent In January</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 New home sales fell 9 percent in January, pushing sales activity to its slowest pace since the end of the last recession, the government said Wednesday as the housing industry continued to stagger following the October stock market collapse. A downturn in housing has often been the harbinger of the onset of a recession, but analysts said they believed falling mortgage rates offered the hope of a rebound in home sales in coming months. In January, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said that sales of new single-family homes fell for the third consecutive month, dropping to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 535,000 units, 26 percent below a year ago and the slowest pace since the last recession was ending in December 1982. In a second lackluster economic report, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said orders for manufactured goods fell 0.6 percent in January to a seasonally adjusted $ 212.6 billion. While this was the first decline in five months, analysts noted that it followed an unusually large 2 percent December increase, a gain which reflected a big jump in demand for jet airplanes. Analysts said the one-month setback did nothing to change their view that American manufacturers are continuing to enjoy a sales boom led by increased demand for exports. Analysts said they were surprised by the sharpness of the decline in home sales, especially since sales had already fallen by 6.8 percent in December and 3.4 percent in November. The decline in new home sales followed other reports showing a big decline in construction starts for new homes in January and the third consecutive monthly decrease in sales of existing homes. `` It looks like housing is bearing the brunt of the stock market decline, but I believe lower interest rates can solve a lot of problems in this industry,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Villanueva </PERSON>, director of economic forecasting for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Builders </ORGANIZATION>. Analysts noted that fixed-rate mortgages have fallen into the single-digit range again, averaging 9.87 percent last week, compared to 10.6 percent when the year began. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON>, chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>, said with `` mortgage rates moving in the right direction'' sales for all of 1988 should rebound to around 650,000 units, only 3 percent below the 1987 sales pace. But other analysts said it remained to be seen whether the drop in mortgage rates will be enough to attract new buyers. They noted that sales have been strong for the past three years and a lot of pent-up demand has been exhausted. `` We simply do n't have the demand for housing that we had in the first part of the recovery,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sumichrast </PERSON>, an economist and publisher of a construction industry newsletter. `` The South, which accounts for almost half of all new homes sold, is still weak and you wo n't see any significant improvement until that area turns around.'' Analysts, however, said they were not ready to forecast an end to the current economic recovery. `` We are seeing a shift away from economic growth driven by housing and other domestic sectors and toward growth in manufacturing and other export sectors,'' said <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Lasko </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The 9 percent decline in new home sales in January was the steepest decline since a 10.9 percent drop last May. The big decline in sales was accompanied by a sharp rise in prices. The median, or mid-point, price of a home shot up 9.7 percent to $ 120,000 while the average home price rose to $ 149,000, an increase of 10.5 percent. Economists said that while home prices have been outpacing rises in overall inflation in recent months, the January surge was skewed upward by the fact that sales rose in the Northeast, a high-priced section of the country, while they were down sharply in the less-expensive South. Sales dropped 24.4 percent in the South to an annual rate of 177,000 units. Sales were off 13.7 percent in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> to a rate of 88,000 units. Sales rose 23 percent in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> to an annual rate of 91,000 units, but this big increase followed a much larger 53 percent December decline. Sales edged up 0.6 percent in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> to an annual rate of 179,000 units.

<TEXT>
 The falling of a piece of rock from the crumbling body of the Sphinx has caused an avalanche of debate over the future of the 4,600-year-old monument and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s other ancient treasures. The principal casualty of the uproar has been <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadry </PERSON>, formerly chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Egyptian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Antiquities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kadry </PERSON> lost his job after accusing his boss, Culture Minister <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON> <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON>, of staging the falling rock incident to reflect badly on <PERSON> Kadry </PERSON>'s stewardship of the Sphinx and the other relics of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s rich past. <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> did not reply to the accusation. The limestone slab fell from the Sphinx's right shoulder on Feb. 7, six days after a sandstorm buffeted <LOCATION> Giza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plateau </LOCATION>. A restoration plan is in the works. The Sphinx has been fitted with sandbags for support and scaffolding to help in the early stages of the effort, and a committee of experts has taken rock samples for analysis to help decide what steps to take. The Sphinx, which is 66 feet high and 160 feet long, has the head of a pharaoh and the body of a crouching lion. Many Egyptologists think the face is that of <PERSON> Chephren </PERSON>, son of <LOCATION> Cheops </LOCATION> and builder of the second pyramid on <LOCATION> Giza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plateau </LOCATION> next to <LOCATION> Cheops </LOCATION>' Great Pyramid. A similiar accident six years ago brought down <PERSON> Kadry </PERSON>'s predecessor, <PERSON> Fouad </PERSON> <PERSON> Oraby </PERSON>, and a Sphinx-restoration project that <PERSON> Kadry </PERSON> began as antiquities chairman remained unfinished when the latest rock fell <PERSON> Zahi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawass </PERSON>, general director of the pyramids area and archaeology adviser to <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON>, will direct the latest restoraton and conservation efforts. The earliest restoration of the Sphinx began 3,600 years ago. `` Two hundred years from now all our monuments will be finished,'' <PERSON> Hawass </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` In the past the monuments were safe from many factors that destroy them because they were buried in the sand. The monuments were not subjected to pollution, the environment, tourists, the things that are ruining them now.'' The emergency work on the Sphinx should be finished by late March, with fallen pieces of limestone replaced and weak places beneath the neck and shoulders treated, <PERSON> Hawass </PERSON> said. Made of weaker limestone than other parts, the neck long has been considered a chronic problem. After the emergency work, experts will draw up an overall restoration plan, <PERSON> Hawass </PERSON> said. A major problem, said <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Arini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> representative of the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, is that previous restorers have not learned why the Sphinx continues to decay. `` In a nutshell, we have been looking at symptoms of the problems, not the problems themselves,'' he said. `` We have been treating it as a rock carved 4,600 years ago, but the limestone is 40 million years old. Our approach should be to look at an object of 40 million years.'' One of the problems facing the team will be how to rid the monument of salt, which is visible on many portions of the body. <PERSON> Shawky </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakhla </PERSON>, chief restorer for the <ORGANIZATION> Antiquity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, said restoration efforts in the 1940s and 1950s added to the Sphinx's salt problem. `` They used cement, and a lot of salt started appearing,'' he said. `` We do n't know if a high water table level below the Sphinx is a real cause of the salt problems, or whether the salt is coming out of the limestone itself.''

 <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> won a one-sided preference poll victory in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s Republican caucuses, nearly doubling the support given Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, party officials said today. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, the former television evangelist, claimed 47 percent of the votes compared with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 24 percent in a poll of 2,020 precinct delegates. Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> took third with 20 percent. The preference poll was not binding, though it gave an indication of the feelings of the delegates who will attend 27 <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> district conventions March 18-26. At those meetings, 400 delegates will be chosen to attend the state convention in late April, when the state's 19 <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> delegates will be named to attend the national convention. A hint of <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s strength was suggested Tuesday when party spokesman <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Shafer </PERSON> noted that <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> regulars had noticed new faces in the precinct caucuses that began Saturday. In other early-contest states, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> supporters have signed up thousands of new party members to participate in caucuses. `` There were people new to the political process,'' said <PERSON> Shafer </PERSON>. `` You could tell by their political platforms _ things like anti-marijuana and anti-abortion _ that they were church folks.'' Many of the delegates had been expected to back <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shafer </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> had competition on the religious front. A Baptist preacher, the Rev. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Prevo </PERSON>, organized members of his Anchorage church to attend the caucuses and support <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The caucuses were open to any registered Republican. Precinct and district delegates have been known to shift allegiances, but the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> delegates to the national conventions never have abandoned their chosen candidates, state <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> GOP is trying to link up with other Western states in hopes of gaining clout, especially in selecting a vice presidential candidate. The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s delegate selection, similar to that of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, is scheduled to begin in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> with precinct caucuses in 10 days.

<TEXT>
 A week ago <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> was reviled as a figurehead president of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> whose chief purpose was to provide a democratic fig leaf to the military forces who ran the country. Now <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> the Meek has become <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> the Martyr. In the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's view, he could become a Panamanian version of <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, the lightning rod for Democratic opposition to former <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. Much of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's strategy toward <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> over the past few days has been built around <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> and his claim to be <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s constitutional president. He is an integral part of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> `` chipmunk strategy'' toward <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> wants to keep gnawing at <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s economy, at military strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s claim to legitimacy and his support at home and abroad <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is the chieftain of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s armed forces, and, according to a federal indictment handed up in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, a cocaine smuggler. Eventually, in the administration's hopes, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> will find his hold on power has evaporated and pack up. In defying <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and ordering him stripped of power, <PERSON> Devalle </PERSON> provided a democratic symbol around whom Panamanians could rally. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s image as a powerless front man dates back to when he took office in the fall of 1985. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was unhappy with the president at the time, <PERSON> Nicolas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ardito </PERSON> <PERSON> Barletta </PERSON>, because of an independent streak, and he forced <PERSON> Barletta </PERSON> from office. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> was sworn in as president under the most unpromising of circumstances. In effect, he had to behave according to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s wishes or he would end up like <PERSON> Barletta </PERSON> He carried that burden for two years. A mystique has developed around <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> since he tried to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and wound up out of office himself. Rather than flee the country after his dismissal, he went into hiding, issuing proclamations to his countrymen, making videotaped messages and frustrating efforts by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s forces to locate him. One of his chief allies these days is <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, a former ambassador to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> who is now a captain of the anti-Noriega campaign in exile. To hear <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> tell it, <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> had wanted to break with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> for five months but was reluctant to do so because of `` confusing'' signals from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> says <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has been suspicious of <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s intentions for some time and kept telling the president, `` Do n't act against me because the gringos are behind me.'' This was based on what <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> felt were reassuring visits by emissaries from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, including <ORGANIZATION> Assistant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Armitage </PERSON>. A turning point occurred in early January, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said, when Panamanian opposition leaders gathered in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> sent an envoy. `` The emissary told us that if we gave him -LRB- <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> -RRB- assurances that we would support him, he was ready to act and dismiss <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. `` We sent him back a message,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. He said the message was: `` We have heard that many times. We want deeds and not words. If you fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and his cronies, we will give you support.'' Contacts with <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> and other <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> opponents continued, with some messages being passed by <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s dentist in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Another turning point took place in early February when two <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> grand juries charged that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was a key figure in an international drug smuggling ring. With an end to the ambiguity in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s position, the opposition front suggested that <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> travel to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to announce his break with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> before the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> agreed, but had second thoughts. He reasoned that firing <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> might be seen `` as acting on instructions from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. But was <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> getting cold feet? At <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>' instigation, Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., called <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> to give him encouragement On Feb. 17, <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and invited Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> to visit him. If <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> was ousted for trying to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> assured him, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would support him as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s constitutional president, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said Eight days later, in an important moment in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s tumultuous history, <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> acted.

 Director <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> and producer <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Pressman </PERSON> have agreed to trim a slur against Puerto Ricans from the home video version of `` Wall Street'' following complaints from the Hispanic community.

 A man who has been on the lam for nearly four years with a pair of 3 -LCB- - ton elephants says he'll come in from the cold if he is assured that <PERSON> Tory </PERSON> and <PERSON> Duchess </PERSON> will not be returned to two men he alleges brutalized them <PERSON> Arlan </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidon </PERSON> raised the Indian elephants from infancy and then sold them to <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Drake </PERSON>. In May 1984, he and the 7-foot-high beasts disappeared in a tractor-trailer. He surfaced last week when he called a newspaper from an undisclosed location to say he'd surrender if guaranteed that the elephants will not be returned to <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> and his father, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>. `` I want to make sure where they are going to. I do n't feel that I'm going to spend this much time trying to protect them so they end up back with the Drakes,'' <PERSON> Seidon </PERSON> told The Star-Ledger of <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>. `` I know I sound like a crazy old man but I'm not,'' he said. The elephants' owners and the president of a national animal trainers group say the animals were not harmed, and both sides accuse each other of lacking an elephant-like memory about the incident. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> says <PERSON> Seidon </PERSON> sold him the elephants for $ 80,000 in 1981, when the Drakes owned an exotic animal ranch in <LOCATION> Tehachapi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, about 200 miles north of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> said Tuesday that <PERSON> Seidon </PERSON> acted as his booking agent for animal shows after the sale but began cheating, taking money and finally the elephants while a circus was in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Seidon </PERSON> told The Star-Ledger he exercised the terms of the sale contract by repossessing the elephants when the Drakes fell behind in their payments. While waiting for money at a <LOCATION> Colts </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Neck </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION> farm, <PERSON> Seidon </PERSON> said, he discovered the animals had wounds caused by hooks piercing their skin during training. On May 4, 1984, after a <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge in <LOCATION> Monmouth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> ordered the elephants returned, he fled with them. His attorney, <PERSON> Estelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, said Tuesday her client never stole money and that he only wanted to help <PERSON> Tory </PERSON> and Duchess. `` The elephants' condition was never aired at the trial,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>. `` He had an agreement that he could repossess the animals if they were abused. His position has not changed.'' But <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Drake </PERSON>, who like his father is now out of the animal business, said <PERSON> Seidon </PERSON>'s story about the elephants' treatment is `` so far-fetched it's unbelievable.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuneo </PERSON>, president of the Illinois-based <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trainers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Breeders </ORGANIZATION>, said the <PERSON> Drakes </PERSON> did not abuse their animals. `` They had beautiful elephants. I even wanted to buy one,'' he said. <PERSON> Cuneo </PERSON> said anyone concerned about an animal's condition can alert state, federal and private monitoring authorities. <PERSON> Seidon </PERSON> has forsaken his <LOCATION> Fordland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, farm and his career preparing animals for circus and television appearances to care for his 25-year-old elephants, who eat about 200 pounds of hay a day. Ms. <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> said she does not know where or how <PERSON> Seidon </PERSON> conceals the elephants. He calls her periodically to check on his case, she said. She said he would come forward to face criminal charges _ third-degree theft carrying a sentence of up to five years in prison, a $ 100,000 fine or both _ if he wins a safe haven for the elephants. The attorney filed a court motion last week to overturn the judgment awarding the animals to the Drakes. County Assistant Prosecutor <PERSON> Alton </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenney </PERSON> said he was not ready to discuss any deals for <PERSON> Seidon </PERSON> and had not heard from Ms. <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Communist Party Acknowledges Anti-Semitic Excesses</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday a sweeping political purge of two decades ago showed `` manifestations of anti-Semitism,'' but it added that most party members took no part in the religious bias. More than 9,000 Jews lost official positions in the 1968 `` anti-Zionist'' purge, and an estimated 12,000-20 ,000 emigrated, more than half the Jews then living in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> The acknowledgement of anti-Semitism by the party newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Trybuna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ludu </ORGANIZATION> carried the authority of an official statement. It also was repeated by the state-run news agency <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> and reported prominently on state TV and radio. But one leader of the 1968 student protests which sparked the purge said the newspaper's article did not go far enough in its condemnation of anti-Semitism and that it repeated past slanders against Jews. It `` amounts to drawing wool over people's eyes,'' said <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Michnik </PERSON>, a writer and prominent leader of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s anti-government opposition. The article in Trybuna Ludu, the official daily of the Polish <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- Party, was timed to coincide with the 20th anniversary of the 1968 `` events.'' Discrimination against Jews, in the guise of `` anti-Zionism'' which had begun after the June 1967 Israeli victory in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war, accelerated sharply after March 1968 student demonstrations around the country against censorship. The purge, which began within the party, soon spread to the government, army, academia, press and other official institutions, The newspaper said some conservative, nationalist party factions at the time `` took advantage of the Jewish ancestry'' of their political rivals. `` They did not realize then that they were being manipulated by various political factions which in different ways made use of their actions.'' Some Western histories have charged that students were provoked by conservative factions using them to provide a pretext for a purge. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> was home to about 3.5 million Jews before the war, who represented about 10 percent of the population. Estimates vary, but the number of Jews in the country now is believed to be between 7,000 and 15,000. Explaining the origins of the anti-Semitism, <PERSON> Trybuna </PERSON> <PERSON> Ludu </PERSON> referred to support of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> expressed by some Polish Jews after the 1967 war and prominent roles held by Jews during the Stalinist period of the late 1940s to early 1950s. `` Polish people preserved the memory of unlawful conduct, of violation of law and order, and of the perpetrators of those offenses. It was easy in 1968 to use that memory as a background for presenting the ` alien ... group' as the source of all evil,'' it said. But the article added that these explanations `` by no means'' could excuse anti-Semitic acts in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Michnik </PERSON>, referring to the explanations, said, `` All the obscenities of the March -LRB- 1968 -RRB- propaganda campaign have been repeated, all of them. What has been done is nothing but cosmetics.'' A leading party theoretician and journalist, <PERSON> Ludwik </PERSON> <PERSON> Krasucki </PERSON>, said Tuesday on Polish TV that the party's attempts to reconsider the history of the period were vital. He expressed hope that by thoroughly reexamining the 1968 events, `` this chapter, which nevertheless ca n't be forgotten, shall once and for all be closed.''

 Negotiators on Wednesday launched their latest and possibly last round of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> peace talks, and the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mediator said he was confident of forging a settlement to end Soviet involvement in the country. `` This was a good session,'' <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s acting foreign minister, <PERSON> Zain </PERSON> <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON>, said as he emerged from the first closed-door meeting late Wednesday. `` We are cautiously optimistic.'' <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is representing the Afghan guerrillas in the talks. <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakil </PERSON>, told reporters that his meeting with mediator <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> was `` very nice.'' <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> has been the go-between since the indirect negotiations began nearly six years ago. Because <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> refuses to recognize <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s Soviet-backed government, the delegations sit in separate rooms, with <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> shuttling back and forth. Before the talks opened, <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> told reporters he believed both sides had the `` political will'' to work out an agreement. Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> announced last month that if a settlement were signed by March 15, the withdrawal of an estimated 115,000 <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> could begin by May 15. The Soviets intervened in 1979 to back the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government in its war with Moslem guerrillas. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> wants any settlement to be accompanied by formation of a transitional government, replacing the present one headed by President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>. It argues that only a broad-based government could prevent new bloodshed in a country where war has already claimed more than a million lives. <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> said the new talks would `` last as long as necessary'' to reach an agreement and added, `` Perhaps it will be signed earlier than you think.'' He said some `` difficult'' problems remained but said he was sure they could be resolved soon. <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> did n't say what those problems were, but reports have suggested they focus on the timetable for the Soviet withdrawal and the timing of the cutoff of military aid to the warring sides. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year gave an estimated $ 700 million worth of military assistance to the 200,000 insurgents fighting the Soviets and the smaller Afghan forces. <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> will decide next week whether it is prepared to sign a settlement with the present Afghan leadership. The decision will come after consultations Sunday between Prime Minister <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Junejo </PERSON> and political leaders, including those from opposition groups. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> has argued that under current conditions, the more than 3 million Afghan refugees in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and another 2 million in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> could not return home. <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> said, `` Civil strife is part of the way of life there,'' and he said there was a `` posibility'' that it would continue. But he added that he believed that the `` people of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> are tired of this conflict, that they want peace.'' <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> said he had been in contact with representatives of several countries, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, to discuss humanitarian aid to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> after a settlement. `` I have the feeling that there will be a broad international effort,'' he said. The sense of optimism was not shared by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which is not participating in the talks. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> has refused to participate as long as the Moslem resistance is not invited. Iranian ambassador <PERSON> Sirous </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasseri </PERSON> told reporters that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> attaches `` no significance to the settlement as it is being forumulated here.'' He said the main problems were related to formation of a government acceptable to all Afghans and the phasing of the Soviet pullout. `` I doubt very much that this could be solved here,'' he said.

 Gov.-elect <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> is testing his influence by backing a candidate to take his old seat in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>, but so far his favorite is running no better than second. State Sen. <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, the front-runner in the field of 10, says he has not worried about <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>'s endorsement of <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiner </PERSON>, former editor of the <ORGANIZATION> Shreveport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'm just trying to see folks and I'm taking it day by day,'' said <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, a Democrat. If no candidate wins a majority of the non-partisan vote on March 8, a runoff between the top two would be held on April 16. The winner will fill <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>'s unexpired term and faces re-election this fall. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> resigned the seat effective March 14, the day he takes office as governor, replacing <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>. The field also includes state Rep. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> `` Buddy'' <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, who lost the seat to <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> in 1980 after one term during which he was acquitted of charges in a vote-buying scandal. <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> later returned to the state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> but lost a race last year for state treasurer. The other candidates include <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> McCrery </PERSON>, the lone Republican and formerly <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>'s top aide; <PERSON> June </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, an administrator at <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University-Shreveport </ORGANIZATION> and the only black in the race; Mayor <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Byars </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Minden </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Shreveport </LOCATION> lawyers <PERSON> Troy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bain </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>; <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, a retired <LOCATION> Shreveport </LOCATION> businessman; and <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsh </PERSON>, a fencing contractor from <LOCATION> Mansfield </LOCATION>. Recent polls by the Journal and joint polls by the <ORGANIZATION> Shreveport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> KSLA-TV </ORGANIZATION> have shown <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> ahead. In the Journal poll published Feb. 19, <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> had the support of 26 percent, followed by <PERSON> Tiner </PERSON> with 16 percent and <PERSON> McCrery </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> close behind. The Times-KSLA poll released on Feb. 26 had <PERSON> Tiner </PERSON> running third, five points behind <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION>, a state senator since 1976, would not predict who would be in the runoff with him. `` Whoever I'm in a runoff with, I can beat,'' he said. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>, who insists he has n't formally endorsed anyone, recently appeared at a fundraiser for <PERSON> Tiner </PERSON> and gave him a campaign contribution. `` That's it,'' <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> said of his efforts. `` I said publicly, the truth. ` Who am I going to vote for?' I said <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiner </PERSON>. We're 20-year friends `` But frankly, I've got other friends in that race. <PERSON> June </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, great person. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> McCrery </PERSON>, great person.

<HEAD>Harvard Woman Challenges Exclusivity of All-Male Clubs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> student who contends she is being excluded from the breeding grounds of power is challenging the membership policies of nine exclusive all-male student clubs. In her complaint before <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Discrimination </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schkolnick </PERSON> argues that the Fly and eight other `` final clubs'' may be violating state laws prohibiting sexual discrimination in public institutions by refusing to admit women. <PERSON> Schkolnick </PERSON> said in a recent interview that she picked the Fly at random as the target of her suit, and considers it representative of the other clubs. The commission, a quasi-legal entity, has the power to investigate cases, award damages, and seek injuctions. The clubhouses are located in some of the most expensive real estate holdings in and around <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Square </ORGANIZATION>, discreetly shielded by tall hedges and unmarked doors. Some have separate entraces for women visitors. They were originally called final clubs to distinguish them from waiting clubs _ less exclusive, now extinct organizations. Evolving from fraternities to eating clubs in the past century, they became social meeting places by the 1950s. Past members have included both <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> and several members of the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> clan. <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> formally severed ties to the clubs in 1984, after members refused a university demand to admit women. But <PERSON> Schkolnick </PERSON>'s case rests on the argument that the clubs remain an integral part of student life and can not be considered private. The issue has become a major topic of debate on campus. The undergraduate student council last week narrowly rejected a proposal to endorse <PERSON> Schkolnik </PERSON>'s cause, but voted to reimburse $ 250 in office costs to a lawyer who offered to help her without a fee. <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> Professor <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dershowitz </PERSON> expressed moral support, urging council members to back <PERSON> Schkolnick </PERSON>. `` I think it's the first major challenge to what have been very entrenched institutions at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Dershowitz </PERSON> said in an interview. `` These finals clubs are the minor leagues for the power clubs in the major cities, the all-male ones.'' <PERSON> Dershowitz </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> student, compared the clubs to <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> groups `` so secret I did n't even know about them until I graduated,'' and to <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s two remaining all-male eating clubs, now appealing a state order to admit women. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolten </PERSON>, vice president of public relations in the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> said, `` We support the philosophy of what she's doing totally, and I hope she wins.'' Schkolnick, a 21-year-old philosophy senior from <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, said she was the target of a rash of crank calls, `` some obscene, others frightening,'' for several weeks after she filed her complaint Dec. 14. She suggested that the clubs serve as old-boy networks to the detriment of women. `` These are power centers, and these people are being fed into powerful positions, and women are being excluded,'' she said. `` I'm going to be a lawyer one day, and I could have used some of these positions that members are exposed to. The clubs, in turn, deny that their members gain undue advantage through networking and argue they are strictly private organizations which should be allowed to decide on membership. `` There are some people in the clubs established in business, but it's definitely not an institutionalized process through which you secure interviews through alumni,'' said <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Novak </PERSON>, former president of the <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> final club. <PERSON> Novak </PERSON>, who graduated last year, was the only one of several final club members polled on the controversy willing to go on the record. <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Malone </PERSON>, a lawyer retained by the Fly, declined comment. The clubs do not publicize their membership rolls. But several students estimated that more than 10 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>'s undergraduate males belong Total undergraduate enrollment is about 6,400. <PERSON> Novak </PERSON> said membership did n't help him in his job search. `` The fact that after being president for a year, I was still sitting around from June till Jan. 1, that will give you an idea about ... how effective alumni ties are,'' said <PERSON> Novak </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Barrington </LOCATION>, R.I.

<HEAD>Court Urged To Block States From Seizing Inmates' Federal Benefits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> was urged on Wednesday to block states from recouping the costs of keeping criminals behind bars by seizing money which prison inmates receive in federal benefits. Lawyers representing the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and a former prison inmate attacked an <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> law that let authorities seize for state use an inmate's Social Security or Veterans Administration benefits. They said the law, similar to those enacted in four other states, conflicts with federal laws specificially barring any legal action aimed at diverting benefits away from designated recipients. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> could have made an exception for state institutional care,'' argued <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON>. `` But <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has not done so here. In our view, that is simply the end of the issue.'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> lawyer representing former state prison inmate <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, also contended that the <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> law `` must fall.'' The issue before the high court is not whether those inmates with available money may be charged for their imprisonment but whether states may get at money the inmates receive in federal benefits. The impact of the justices' decision, expected by July, has been blunted somewhat by laws passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1980 and 1983 withholding or limiting benefits otherwise due imprisoned felons. The justices asked few questions, and what had been scheduled as a hour-long argument session was over in 35 minutes. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> had served 11 years of a 21-year sentence at a Pine Bluff prison for second-degree murder when he turned 62. He started receiving $ 275 a month in Social Security retirement benefits. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> was released from prison in late 1984 but is seeking to recover $ 3,600 in benefits confiscated by the state. The <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> in 1981 had passed an Inmate Care and Custody Reimbursement Act. Under it, state authorities may seek court approval to seize an inmate's estate _ income from any source. Similar laws have been enacted in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration lawyers had told the justices in briefs submitted previously that the rationale used by the <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in upholding the 1981 state law `` would seem to validate the attachment of Social Security and <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> benefits paid to persons confined in state mental hospitals or in other institutions where they are provided care by the state.'' They said it is important for the <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> law to be invalidated so the growing number of states asking prison inmates to help foot the bill of their imprisonment will not seize federal benefits. <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> told the justices Wednesday that <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> merely was trying to prevent `` windfall benefits'' for prison inmates who receive their food, clothing and medical care at state expense. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' intent of protecting people `` from the rigors of poverty'' was `` not frustrated by the <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> statute at all.'' Responding to <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>'s contention that the state had not `` created any kind of hardship,'' <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON> said his client could make good use of the money wrongly withheld from him. <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON> described <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> as `` a 69-year-old man who ca n't get a job'' and who would be destitute if he had not been cared for by relatives. The case is <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, 86-6124.

<HEAD>Students End Nine-Day Occupation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>AMHERST, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A nine-day sit-in by minority students at <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> ended Wednesday with the signing of a 16-point agreement designed to encourage racial harmony at the small private school. `` The acceptance of our demands by the administration is both an acknowledgment of institutional indifference and neglect and of the immediate need for redress,'' <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Fearman </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the protesters, told a gathering of 150 students. The group watched as college President <PERSON> Adele </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> and two other administrators signed the document outside the dormitory office occupied by an estimated 40 protesters since Feb. 23. The six-page settlement provided for a dean of multicultural affairs, an adviser for the group that occupied <ORGANIZATION> Dakin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> office and at least $ 4,500 in yearly funding for the group. The adminstration also agreed to take no disciplinary action against the students and to allow them to make up work they missed during the sit-in. `` I think the institution won,'' <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> said after the signing. `` For the last several years we've been working to improve student life and this represents a finishing of the old agenda. `` A number of the things they asked for were already in place, but I think the occupation strengthened the institution,'' she said. Dean of Students <PERSON> Trey </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said the occupation had taken a toll on many at the liberal arts school, where about 100 of the 1,100 students are minorities. `` The students are exhausted, the president is sick. But it's better that it took us only one week than forever,'' he said The occupation was prompted by what students described as the school's longstanding indifference to their concerns. `` They were claiming this is a multiculturally diverse community, which is n't true,'' said protester <PERSON> Penny </PERSON> <PERSON> Predmas </PERSON>. College officials said the allegation was a surprise, given the school's image as a progressive alternative to the sort of traditional liberal arts education offered at nearby <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Holyoke </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> colleges. <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> students design their own courses of study and graduate after passing three divisional examinations requiring them to complete individual research projects and some classwork. `` We're way in front in transforming curriculum to be much more global,'' said Faculty Dean <PERSON> Penina </PERSON> <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON>, `` but we're lagging in recruiting of minority students and we're trying as hard as we can.'' The agreement came two weeks after the end of an occupation at nearby <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> that was sparked by campus racial violence. That takeover ended when Chancellor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> agreed to increase funding of minority student programs and other demands. A university disciplinary hearing began Tuesday into allegations that five white male students assaulted two black male students on Feb. 7, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>. Protesters at <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> said racial violence is rare on their campus, but said there have been several instances of harassment and discrimination since a cross was found burning on a building lawn 11 years ago. The protesters said, however, that the sympathy shown them by students and faculty during the occupation had changed their minds about warning minorities away from the school. `` I really would tell them to come here,'' said <PERSON> Predmas </PERSON>. A few white students watching the signing ceremony said they supported the protesters' aims, but disagreed over the wisdom of occupying the dormitory office. `` There basically was a lot of friction,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Trunnell </PERSON>. `` The feeling was, ` Either you're in or out. Either you support us or you do n't.' Well, no two of us agreed on this campus, but it's important that we band together to solve these sorts of problems.

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called himself `` the most stable'' candidate Wednesday, crediting himself with good judgment that sets him apart in the presidential race. `` You want steadiness.

The vice president told the shipyard workers that <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> wanted to reduce the number of <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> battleships. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called that `` a dumb idea.'' Beginning his day in <LOCATION> Clearwater </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> talked of his five children _ including <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Secretary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Jeb </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ and 10 grandchildren, and also said his support of prayer in the schools is of long standing. `` They ought to take a look at my family and what I epitomize in this regard,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also served boiled crawfish at a small rally in <LOCATION> Biloxi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, spoke briefly to supporters at the Mobile, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, airport and planned to participate in a Cajun feast in <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, before heading to <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>.

 Democrat <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> did n't have a paid staff, much money or very high hopes in overwhelmingly white <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, but his campaign pulled off a strong second-place finish in Tuesday's presidential primary. `` It has a tremendous significance on a symbolic level,'' <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> political science professor, said Wednesday. `` This is exactly what <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> hoped for. He can now say he appealed to more than just blacks going into Super Tuesday.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> finished with 26 percent, behind <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, whose 15-person paid staff and 60-plus volunteers helped him capture 57 percent of the vote. Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primary. `` This is a home-grown campaign where people have worked all the time, constantly on the issues,'' said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> of the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign. `` We're working on issues that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is talking about.'' <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said many of those who worked for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also were active in grass roots organizations supporting low-income Vermonters and the state's financially distressed dairy farmers. Many also have protested apartheid in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> raked in three times as many votes Tuesday as he did in 1984, when he won 7.8 percent of the vote. According to unofficial results, with 100 percent of the state's 262 precincts reporting, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had 57 percent, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> 26 percent, Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> 8 percent; Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> 5 percent and former Sen. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, who won <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> in 1984, 4 percent Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> was not on the ballot here. On the Republican side, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> received 49 percent, Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> 39 percent, former television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> 5 percent and Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> 4 percent. Political observers had predicted a tight race between <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> for second place, but <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> stole the show. He ran a strong second in the state's largest city of <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> and actually beat <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in 27 smaller communities and tied him in two. `` It depended really on volunteers,'' said <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, a political science professor at <ORGANIZATION> Middlebury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. `` They were n't putting up lawn signs _ they were n't doing mailings To get almost 30 percent of the vote just on grass roots says something about <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s appeal.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s campaign was propelled by the alliance of the <ORGANIZATION> Rainbow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> and its most prominent member, <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>, a socialist, endorsed <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> during one of his recent visits to the state. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was one of the few candidates to actively campaign in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> in the last days before the election.

<HEAD>Bank Profits in 1987 Lowest Since Depression</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Banks recorded their least profitable year since the Great Depression in 1987, but a top federal regulator said Wednesday he sees better days ahead. The nation's federally insured commercial banks earned $ 3.7 billion last year on assets of $ 3 trillion, down from $ 17.5 billion earnings in 1986, said <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. That amounted to a return on assets of only 0.13 percent last year and was the lowest level since the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>, which insures deposits of up to $ 100,000, was established in 1934 The year-to-year drop in earnings was due entirely to large banks adding to reserves to cover anticipated losses on loans to Third World countries, <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said. Nine of the 10 largest banks and 17 of the 25 largest reported a loss for 1987. `` Absent the extraordinary reserving for -LRB- developing country -RRB- loans ... net income would have been roughly equal to 1986's level,'' <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said in the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>'s bank profile for the fourth quarter of 1987 <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said he believed there was a good chance that banks could avoid further large additions to reserves for bad Third World loans and said, `` The outlook for 1988 is cautiously optimistic.'' `` Barring any new shocks, loan loss provisioning should be lower than usual this year, and profitablity at money center and regional banks will be much improved,'' <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said, predicting that bank profits this year could return to about the 1986 level. He also said office occupancy rates and other signs appear to indicate that the economy of the <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>, which accounted for more than half of last year's bank failures, may have hit bottom and be on the rebound. But he cautioned that much of the region's health depends on oil prices remaining stable or rising The oil-producing states of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> accounted for 95 of last year's 184 bank failures, the most recorded since 1933. Twenty-eight banks have failed in the first two months of this year, 16 of them in the three oil states. The number of federally insured commercial banks, which is shrinking because of failures and mergers, dwindled from a peak of about 14,500 in 1985 to about 13,700 last year, the lowest number since 1971. The results for all of 1987 masked a more positive fourth quarter. Despite loan loss provisions of $ 7.7 billion for the quarter, banks posted a $ 3.2 billion profit, 25 percent higher than the last quarter of 1986. <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said banks were especially strengthened in the fourth quarter by a flood of new deposits as investors after the Oct. 19 stock market crash pulled their money out of stocks and put it into insured bank accounts. The crash also triggered a surge in loan demand from stock brokerages and other financial service firms, the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> chairman said. And, because the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> pumped money into the economy in response to the crash, banks are enjoying lower interest rates. Another encouraging sign, <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said, was the drop from 1,609 to 1,559 during the last half of 1987 in the number of banks on the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>'s problem list. In addition, the number of banks losing money fell for the first time since 1980. The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> estimated that 2,366 banks were unprofitable last year, down from 2,784 in 1986 and 2,453 in 1985. In a report earlier this week, the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> said its insurance fund held steady in 1987 despite the heavy load of bank failures. The fund finished the year at $ 18.3 billion, up modestly from $ 18.25 billion at the end of 1986. The slight gain was posted despite a provision for the second-largest bank rescue ever by the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>. Shareholders of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bancorporation </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> are scheduled to vote Friday on a restructuring package that would involve nearly $ 1 billion in government assistance.

<HEAD>High Court Throws Out Award to City Employee Over Firing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday made it more difficult for people to win lawsuits against a city government based on claims that low-ranking officials violated their rights. But the decision in a <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> case yielded no clear-cut majority view and left some key questions unanswered By a 7-1 vote, the justices threw out a $ 15,000 award <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> was ordered to pay <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Praprotnik </PERSON>, a fired city architect. But only four of the seven justices voting to overturn the award joined in the court's main opinion, creating the possibility that a future case could prompt a different result. Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, who wrote the court's main opinion, said generally only the highest ranking city officials can commit constitutional violations that make the city liable. In the case of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, that is limited to the mayor, city aldermen and the civil service commission, she said. Cities may not be held liable unless those who claim their rights were violated prove the `` existence of an unconstitutional municipal policy,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said. A city can not be sued successfully based on the claim that high-ranking officials failed to override a subordinate's decision that violated someone's rights, she added. `` Simply going along with discretionary decisions made by one's subordinates ... is not a delegation to them of the authority to make policy,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said She also said that state law, and not a jury's examination of the facts in a particular case, determines who the policy makers are in a city. Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, in a separate opinion, said <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>'s opinion `` turns a blind eye to reality'' in assuming who makes policy in a particular community. <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>'s opinion `` ultimately would permit municipalities to insulate themselves from liability for the acts of all but a small minority of actual city policy makers.'' <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>'s opinion was joined by Justices <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON>. Nonetheless, all three voted with <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> and three other justices to throw out Praprotnik's $ 15,000 award. They said a <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> official who transferred <PERSON> Praprotnik </PERSON> to a job that led to his firing lacked policy-making authority. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>'s opinion was joined by Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> and Justices <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> and <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON>. Justice <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> dissented, voting to uphold <PERSON> Praprotnik </PERSON>'s lower court victory. Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who only recently joined the court, did not take part in the decision. <PERSON> Praprotnik </PERSON> was a mid-level manager in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>' community development agency when in 1980 he became embroiled with his superiors over the proposed installation by the city of a controversial sculpture. <PERSON> Praprotnik </PERSON> was suspended for 15 days by a superior for having accepted outside employment without prior approval. But after he appealed to the city civil service commission, he was reinstated with back pay. Then in 1982 he was transferred to another city agency, and his job responsibilities were reduced. He was fired, in what the city said was a budget-cutting move, on Dec. 30, 1983. <PERSON> Praprotnik </PERSON> then sued under a federal civil rights law, charging he was shunted to a dead-end job and then kicked out because of his appeal to the civil service commission for his suspension back in 1980. A jury awarded him $ 30,000. The 8th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> reduced the amount to $ 15,000 while ruling he was fired for exercising his constitutional rights. The appeals court said the city was liable, even though the jury exonerated the individual officials sued by <PERSON> Praprotnik </PERSON>. The justices on Wednesday ordered further lower court hearings for <PERSON> Praprotnik </PERSON> to determine whether he still has a viable case. In another ruling, the justices, by a 4-4 vote, ruled that an airline may be forced to continue to collect union dues from workers after its contract with employees has expired. The court upheld rulings that forced <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> to continue the dues check-off for replacement employees during a strike by flight attendants in 1986. <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> also was forced to collect dues from the strikers once they returned to work. The ruling was not accompanied by any written opinion or by any indication of how each individual justice voted.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that orders to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories for manufactured goods fell 0.6 percent in January, the first decline in five months, but private economists said the setback was not serious. The report said orders for both durable and non-durable goods dropped to a seasonally adjusted $ 212.6 billion in January, down $ 1.25 billion from December, when orders had posted a huge 2 percent increase. It was the first setback in orders since a 1.4 percent drop in August, but economists discounted the decline, contending that it reflected a swing in the volatile transportation category. Transportation orders declined 8.8 percent in January, erasing an 8.9 percent December increase, which had reflected a big jump in orders for passenger jets. Without the large swings in transportation, factory orders would have climbed 0.8 percent in January following a 0.9 percent December rise. Manufacturing has been enjoying steady increases over the past year as <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> producers enjoy booming export sales spurred by the decline in the value of the dollar. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> WEFA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a private forecasting firm, said that the January factory orders showed more strength than analysts had been expecting. He said manufacturing demand is holding up well despite a large increase in business inventories during the final three months of the year. The big inventory rise has raised concerns that orders will need to be cut until the backlog of unsold goods is reduced. `` The inventory scare may be somewhat overblown. If it was that serious, we would probably see orders weakening more sharply,'' he said. `` While the economy is not booming, manufacturing is still on an upward trend and we are likely to miss a recession.'' The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is counting on continued strength in export sales to provide almost half of the expected growth in the overall economy this year. The January decline in manufactured goods included a 1.5 percent drop in demand for durable goods. An advance report a week ago put the January decline in durable goods at 2.8 percent. Orders for non-durable goods, items not expected to last at least three years, rose 0.5 percent in January, erasing a 0.5 percent December decline. Demand for military equipment fell 3.8 percent in January following a 7.1 percent drop in December. Orders for non-defense capital goods, a key category which reflects industry plans to expand and modernize, rose 2.6 percent in January following a 12.6 percent December advance. Shipments of manufactured goods fell 1.7 percent in January to $ 207.7 billion following a 2 percent December increase.

 At least one person was killed in ethnic riots in a southern republic but the violence was short-lived, a Soviet television employee in the region said Wednesday. The violence occurred Sunday in <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION>, an industrial city of more than 160,000 people in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. The newspaper in <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION>, the republic's capital, did not mention casualties in its report Wednesday, but said arrests were made. `` Order and peace have been ensured by law enforcement organs. People caught in the unrest have been detained,'' said the newspaper, <PERSON> Bakinsky </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabochy </PERSON>. It did not give the number of arrests. Trouble between Armenians and <PERSON> Azerbaijanis </PERSON> began when ethnic Armenians in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, a region assigned to <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, began demonstrating for union with the neighboring <LOCATION> Caucasian </LOCATION> republic of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. The protest spread to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s capital, <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said Tuesday he could not confirm reports by <LOCATION> Armenian </LOCATION> activists that up to 20 people were killed in <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION>, but added: `` There was hooliganism and there can be deaths in such cases.'' The television worker reached by telephone mentioned a `` small number of victims.'' He identified himself as a duty officer at the <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION> broadcast studios but would not give his namem, Pressed for a figure, he said one or two people were killed. He said he did not know the circumstances of the deaths, but gave a description of how the riots began. About 50 to 60 young ethnic <PERSON> Azerbaijanis </PERSON> who live in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> traveled to <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION> last weekend and spoke of ethnic problems in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, he said. `` They were frightened,'' said the television employee, who said he was half Armenian and half Azerbaijani. `` When they told their relatives, and friends at the vocational school, everyone got very excited.'' A group of `` young hooligans'' then went on a rampage, he said. `` It's not a nationality problem, it's just hooliganism,'' he declared, adding that the violence was limited to Sunday. The official media have not reported on causes of the disturbance. They said Wednesday that <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION> was calm. `` The unrest has been stopped,'' the <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION> paper said. `` Businesses and establishments of trade and public dining places are working in a normal rhythm and classes are taking place in schools.'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> read the newspaper article to The Associated Press over the telephone. Copies of the paper itself wo n't reach <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for several days. It and <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION> radio said <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>'s premier, <PERSON> Gasan </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidov </PERSON>, had traveled to <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> told the news briefing Tuesday that authorities put <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION> under curfew. He suggested the unrest there and elsewhere in the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> was due to `` mistakes'' made 65 years ago when a territory inhabited largely by Armenians was made part of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. More than three-quarters of the 157,000 people in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> are ethnic Armenians. Predominantly Moslem <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> is the largest of three Soviet republics in the region, bordered on the west by largely <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armenia </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and on the north by the Russian republic. The <LOCATION> Caspian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> runs for nearly 800 miles along its eastern edge. Foreign journalists based in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> have been barred from the region and only sporadic reports from witnesses, activists and official media have reached <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Few telephone calls got through to <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION> on Wednesday. A man answering the telephone at the <ORGANIZATION> Azerbaijan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION> said `` everything is over'' in <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION>. The conversation was cut off before a reporter could ask his name and position. <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION> radio, monitored by the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said two non-voting members of the national <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Georgy </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Razumovsky </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pyotr </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Demichev </PERSON>, visited businesses and other establishments in <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION> to speak to `` working people of these multinational collectives.''

 The last resident of the small motel where <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> died refused orders from sheriff's deputies to leave the rundown building Wednesday and was carried sobbing to the sidewalk. `` You people are making a mistake. You people are making a mistake,'' said <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 37, who had been holed up at The <LOCATION> Lorraine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Motel </LOCATION> since it was closed by state order Jan. 11 to make way for an $ 8.8 million civil rights museum. Deputies evicted Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> after forcing open the door to the room where she had set up residence. A picture of King and an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag decorated the large front window of her room, about 25 feet from where the civil rights leader was felled by an assassin's rifle slug. They carried her to the sidewalk outside the chain-link fence surrounding the motel, put her down and walked away. `` I refuse to stand up,'' she said. A few moments later, however, she moved to a straight-back wooden chair retrieved from her belongings stacked nearby under a sheet of black plastic to keep off a light rain. `` If I have to sit out here on this street, I refuse to go,'' she said. `` I'm not going anywyere.'' <PERSON> Ms. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who has lived and worked at the <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> for 11 years, said the museum project will speed efforts to gentrify her low-income neighborhood. `` I'm trying to help the people who live in this area. We're being forced out,'' she said Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said she has relatives in other parts of town, but does not want to move from neighborhood. She said she can not afford to rent an apartment in the area. She said the <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> should be turned into housing for the homeless. Her eviction was watched by a crowd of news reporters and about a dozen spectators. Several well-wishers spoke with Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> after the deputies left. King was killed at the <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> on April 4, 1968 while helping organize a strike by city sanitation workers. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, a prison escapee from <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, pleaded guilty to the killing and is serving a 99-year sentence at the Southeast Tennessee Regional Prison. The <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON>, which has fallen into disrepair over the years, was bought at a foreclosure auction in 1982 by a citizens group pushing plans for a civil rights museum at the site. The state has appropriated $ 4.4 million for the project and city and county governments have agreed to match that amount. The state has title to the property and will build and operate the museum, scheduled to open in 1991. Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> repeatedly ignored requests to move, and the state obtained a court order Tuesday directing sheriff's deputies to evict her. When deputies arrived, Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> retreated to her room and refused to open the door. <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, an administrative assistant to the <LOCATION> Shelby </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff, pleaded with her to leave peacefully. `` We're just doing our job,'' <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> shouted to Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> as deputies prepared to force open the door.

 <PERSON> Bernhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> has inherited $ 140,550 from his father's estate, but the man known as the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> subway gunman has huge legal bills that will quickly eat that up, and more, his attorney says. `` That wo n't go very far in defending him on anything,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelner </PERSON>, an attorney defending <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> in three civil cases asking a total of $ 63 million in damages. <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON>, 40, was sentenced last October to six months in jail and five years' probation for carrying an unlicensed gun, which he used to shoot four teen-agers on a subway in December 1984. Three of the four are suing him for injuries and punitive damages. <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON>, who claimed the shootings were in self-defense, is free on $ 5,000 bond while his case is appealed. His father, <PERSON> Bernhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, died in 1984, and his estate was recently settled in <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Probate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. After payment of taxes, there was $ 562,200 to be split between the younger <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON>, his brother and two sisters. The estate's attorney, <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Bornstein </PERSON>, said Wednesday that all money had been distributed to the heirs within the past few days. The elder <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> moved to <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> in 1963 from <LOCATION> Rhinebeck </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, where the family owned a dairy, a bookbinding company and real estate. He joined his brothers <PERSON> Fritz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ludwig </PERSON> in developing a subdivision in east <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kelner </PERSON> said Tuesday that <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON>, an electronics specialist, ca n't afford to take a taxi from <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> for civil court appearances It's dangerous for <PERSON> Goetz </PERSON> to use public transportation, the lawyer said.

<HEAD>New Rules Being Developed to Help Farmers Pay Off FmHA Loans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 New rules are being prepared to help farmers pay off loans owed to the <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, including provisions that allow the agency to write off some of the debt so that families can stay on the land, officials said Wednesday. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, an FmHA spokesman, said the new rules probably will be ready by June. In many cases, over-burdened borrowers could have much of their debt written off, trimmed back to reflect their assets in hopes of keeping them in business. However, <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> said he had no estimate of how much debt the <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION> might write off under the new rules. `` There's just no way of knowing,'' he said. `` It'll be each individual case all the way through.'' At the end of the 1987 fiscal year on Sept. 30, <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> said, 261,291 <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION> borrowers owed the agency about $ 26 billion. Of that, 127,671 were delinquent, owing $ 6.6 billion, including principal and interest. The new rules are a result of a bill passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in December calling on the <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION>, an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> agency that serves as a `` lender of last resort'' for the nation's farmers, to go easier on borrowers who are behind in their payments. The new law requires the agency to do whatever possible to restructure loans in order to keep FmHA borrowers in business. `` Our attitude is going to be different,'' <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. `` We want to make the new act work, and we're going to have a lot of room to maneuver to restructure these loans.'' <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, an attorney with the <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, said, `` I'm thrilled they are apparently taking this legislation seriously and are trying to make it work.'' Her group has been active for years in challenging FmHA policies aimed at tougher enforcement of agency collection policies, including a 1983 lawsuit that led to a suspension of foreclosure actions until regulations were redesigned to let borrowers know their alternatives. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, partly at the prodding of the activist organizations, agreed that <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION> should slow down and overhaul its policies. As a last resort, the new rules would let <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION> write off debts in excess of a borrower's assets, <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> said. For example, if a farmer's assets were $ 150,000 and debts totaled $ 500,000, the write-off could be as much as $ 350,000 if the FmHA determined the farmer could handle the remainder by staying in business. `` It makes sense, then, to keep that person in business and write off the difference between what they owe and their assets _ if the government stands a chance of retrieving more by keeping that farmer going,'' <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> said. `` We're trying to carry out the intent of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 as closely as we can.''

<HEAD>Senate Shouldn't Bind Future Presidents on INF Pact Interpretation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s legal adviser said Wednesday that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> should not revise the arms pact with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to bind future administrations to the current understanding of its intent. `` I do n't think it is necessary or desirable to do that kind of thing,'' legal adviser <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON> said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. But an aide to Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., said that based on discussions <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> has had with senators from both parties, he expects `` there to be language in the ratification resolution addressing the treaty interpretation issues. Few people disagree over the meaning of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty signed at the U.S.-Soviet summit in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last December calling on the superpowers to destroy their nuclear missiles with ranges of 300 miles to 3,000 miles. The heart of the dispute, rather, is interpretation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON> is the author of the `` broad interpretation'' of the ABM treaty which would allow wider testing of components of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Strategic Defense Initiative, known as Star Wars. <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>'s legislative aide, <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Warburg </PERSON>, said the language expected in the INF resolution `` would contain a more broad statement concerning the intepretation of treaties generally,'' including the ABM pact. <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, along with Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, D-Del., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, have been discussing the issue with Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> but have not reached agreement, <PERSON> Warburg </PERSON> <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON> said inclusion of restrictive language in a resolution ratifying the INF treaty would not be binding on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and could complicate rather than resolve the issue. `` I know that they are not going to get a settlement of the ABM dispute this way,'' <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON> said. `` It is a potential problem for INF ratification, and I think overwhelmingly people support INF ratification,'' he said. <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> had sent the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> the 31-volume negotiating record of the INF pact and also had agreed that any testimony by administration officials would be `` authoritative'' and reflect the president's understanding of the treaty. `` Those practical things have been achieved,'' <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON> said. While the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> can bind the administration to a particular interpretation of either the INF or the ABM treaties, he said, it can not bind the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, unless the treaties are renegotiated. `` The treaty reflects two relationships,'' he said. `` It reflects a relationship between two sovereign nations, and then it also reflects the relations betwen the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> executive branch and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` When you talk about the meaning of a treaty, you are talking about the international relationship. You are talking about what binds the two nations,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 An American artist said Wednesday he signed an agreement with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to launch what could be the first sculpture in space: a huge ring with `` peace'' written on it in different languages. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> said he signed the agreement last week with <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> Poletayev </PERSON>, a representative of the Soviet space agency Glavkosmos, to launch the sculpture in 1990 or 1991. He said the ring, with a diameter of 20 feet, would be transported on a <ORGANIZATION> Proton </ORGANIZATION> rocket to the Mir space station, from which it would be deployed. <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> will be responsible for financing the launch and sculpture, at an estimated cost of $ 300,000. Funding is to come from private contributions of at least $ 35 each, said <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>, who calls the project `` Orbiting Unification Ring Satellite,'' or OURS. `` This project is a gesture of getting the public involved in something that could send a sentiment of world peace'' into space, said <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>, 39. <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> said he asked <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> if it wanted to launch a similar sculpture but had not received a reply. <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> said the ring would be a `` prototype'' for another project in the works _ a 3,300-foot-diameter sculpture that he hopes will be put in orbit by the year 200. He said it would be visible from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> said the sculptures would be made of a foil-like substance which would be inflated in space and then become rigid when exposed to sunlight. He said the technology, known as ISRS for Inflatable, Space Rigidized Structures, had been developed by a Swiss company, <ORGANIZATION> Contraves </ORGANIZATION>. He said he was collaborating with <ORGANIZATION> Contraves </ORGANIZATION> on the projects. <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> said he grew up near <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION> and worked there for two summers while he was a student. He moved to <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> in 1974 and describes himself as a painter and sculptor.

 Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., on Wednesday unveiled a $ 266 million Democratic plan to bolster the government's emergency food programs, saying `` we can not afford to do less'' to battle <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the bill would increase funding for federal programs for food stamps, school breakfasts, child care food and summer food service. `` We have to ask what the cost of not doing this will be,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said at a news conference. Sen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., said the question of hunger is `` a moral issue'' and `` a test of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s conscience. Rep. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, D-Calif., introduced companion anti-hunger legislation in the House <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said domestic hunger had been largely eradicated by the late 1970s, but that the recession of the early 1980s, coupled with sharp cuts in social programs under the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, has brought it back at record levels. The Emergency Hunger Relief Act of 1988 would focus on the government's food stamp program, a program started under <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, in 1961 The senator argued that benefits for many families are running out well before the end of the month. For a typical family of four, the bill would increase benefits by about six meals per month per person. Eligibility modifications would add about 1 million people to the food stamp program, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> estimated. There now are 18.6 million recipients. The bill also would: _ Allow other non-profit organizations besides schools and local governments to operate the Summer Food Service Program. The current limitations have denied thousands of children nutritious lunches during the summer when schools are closed, the lawmakers said. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said an estimated 170,000 additional children would be receive benefits under the plan. _ Extend the <ORGANIZATION> Temporary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> and authorize $ 50 million annually for the distribution to the needy of corn, wheat and other surplus commodities. _ Increase to $ 10 million a year the authorization for the <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nutrition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION>, which funds soup kitchens and relief centers. The current authorization is at $ 3 million annually. _ Increase school breakfast funding by 3 cents per meal so children can have eggs on most mornings. The bill calls for $ 266 million in new spending in fiscal 1989 and $ 675 million in 1990. `` We could obviously do more, but we can not afford to do less,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. `` The measure ... is designed to be a new declaration of war on hunger, and this time we intend to see that the war stays won.''

 Moslem leader <PERSON> Inamullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, named Wednesday as winner of the Templeton Prize for progress in religion, said his lifetime goal is to heal discord among different faiths. He is the first Moslem to win the $ 390,000 prize, the largest in the world and about $ 40,000 more than the Nobel prizes. `` My life has been spent in the service of mankind seeking peace where there is war, reconciliation where there is conflict, harmony where there is discord,'' <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, 73, of <LOCATION> Karachi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, a founder and secretary-general of the World Moslem <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, added in a message from his home city: `` I do this from my religious conviction and will continue to work with people of different races and religions and with those of different views within the same religion.'' He was cited for his `` tireless work as coordinator for peace between Moslems, Christians and Jews.''

He told the news conference the prize was purposely kept higher than the Nobel prizes because religion was more important than other fields. He said world expenditures for scienctific research amount to $ 1 billion every day, and `` I'm not saying it's not worth the results,'' but `` it should be equaled by research in the spiritual realm.''

 A teen-ager testified Wednesday that his 14-year-old friend plotted the murder of a classmate, saying he wanted `` to know what it was like to kill someone.'' <PERSON> Robbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, 16, told a hushed courtroom how he was twice shown the body by <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON> and even accompanied <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON> and another friend to a pizza parlor to eat after viewing the victim. <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON>, 15, went on trial Wednesday as an adult for the murder of <PERSON> Shaun </PERSON> <PERSON> Ouillette </PERSON>, 14. The body remained near a lonely wooded hilltop for three weeks before another friend wrote an anonymous letter to police. `` <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> said not to say anything,'' <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said. `` He said it could happen to us.

In opening arguments, defense attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said his client suffered from a `` psychiatric illness of major proportions'' and was not in contact with reality. White said <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON> was affected by his use of Ritalin, a stimulant used to calm hyperactive children. <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> testified <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON> began talking about killing someone around Halloween 1986. He refined his plan to lure a victim to a deserted area known as `` The Pits,'' then beat him with a baseball bat. <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON> also planned to cut off his victim's legs `` and toss them. `` I said why?

The teen-ager, testifying in a barely audible voice, told how <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON> named several potential victims before settling on <PERSON> Ouillette </PERSON>, an overweight high school freshman. `` He said he -LRB- <PERSON> Ouillette </PERSON> -RRB- would be the least missed, that he did n't have that many friends,'' <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said he had warned other potential victims not to go to <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON>' home. Although he knew of <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON>' plan to lure <PERSON> Ouillette </PERSON> into the woods with the promise of fireworks, <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said he only suggested to <PERSON> Ouillette </PERSON> that he have <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON> bring the fireworks to school. <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said the day of the murder he saw <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON> walking down the street with a baseball bat and asked if he killed <PERSON> Ouillette </PERSON>. He said <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON> hestitated before admitting to the killing, then agreed to take <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> to the murder scene after leaving a large knife in <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>'s room. <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON> explained how he walked in <PERSON> Ouillette </PERSON>'s footsteps in the snow, then hit him with a bat `` He said <PERSON> Shaun </PERSON> fell down and said ` help me' and <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> hit him again.'' <PERSON> Ouillette </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>, sobbed as she heard the description of her son's murder. <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON> was expressionless. White portrayed his client as a youth from a troubled home obsessed with personal hygiene and fascinated by fire. He told of a note <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON> wrote to a health teacher a <ORGANIZATION> Canton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> which warned of his plans to kill. According to White, the note read in part, `` My problem is that I like to do crazy things ... lately I want to kill people. I hate and I want to set houses on fire.'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said the teacher made note of the letter on a file card, but did nothing until after <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON> was arrested.

 Eleven more people have died after eating improperly prepared soybeans in the Central Java district of <LOCATION> Banyumas </LOCATION>, bringing the death toll to 34, a medical official said Wednesday. <LOCATION> Koentoro </LOCATION>, head of the district health office in <LOCATION> Banyumas </LOCATION>, said the latest victims died Tuesday after eating soybean cakes contaminated with poisonous acid.

The official said poverty had forced villagers to ignore a government ban on eating the cheap food, which sometimes contains the poisonous acid bongkrekik. <PERSON> Koentoro </PERSON> said 33 people still were hospitalized, some in grave condition. Two people who allegedly produced and sold the cakes have been arrested, the ministry official said.

<HEAD>Judge Asks Prosecutors To Examine State ``Blacklisting'' of
Companies</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A state judge has accused the <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> administration of blacklisting construction companies that fail to comply with affirmative action rules, and then allowing the companies to `` buy'' their way off the list. Quoting from a section of federal law defining extortion, state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said he was referring the case to federal and state prosecutors and to the state's <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Goverment Integrity for review. The ruling, in a lawsuit filed by a paving contractors group against the state, was made public Wednesday. `` In the court's view, a judge is under a duty to report potential criminal activity that comes to light in the course of a proceeding pending before him,'' said <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>. `` This is especially so when government officials are involved.'' <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> did not charge that crimes had been committed, and he said his referral to the prosecutors had been recommended by the state's attorney in the case. Administration officials denied wrongdoing or that a blacklist existed. `` It would appear to be somewhat of a strange decision and our counsels will be reviewing it with the -LRB- state -RRB- attorney general's office,'' said <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowley </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for Gov <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>. The suit was filed by the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asphalt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pavement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a group representing 34 contractors, against state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> and state Office of General Services Commissioner <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Egan </PERSON>. It asked that White and <PERSON> Egan </PERSON> stop imposing restrictions on member companies other than what was written in law. In denying a state motion to dismiss the association's lawsuit, <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said one construction company, to get off the blacklist, had agreed to pay $ 150,000 to `` a not-for-profit organization or other support entities, whose purpose is to provide support to the -LRB- state's -RRB- Disadvantaged, Minority, Women's Business Enterprise Program.'' Compelling contractors to enter into such agreements constitutes unethical and possibly criminal conduct, the judge said. The lawsuit stems from an attempt by White, one of the highest ranking blacks in the <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> administration, to crack down on contractors who are not meeting state and federal requirements for hiring minorities, who have established `` front'' companies that falsely claim to be minority owned, or who have engaged in criminal activity such as bid-rigging. White spokesman <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hulbert </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Albany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> that the judge's ruling was `` inflammatory and inappropriate.'' There is nothing illegal about barring contractors from doing business with the state if they have violated state laws or regulations, <PERSON> Hulbert </PERSON> said. Such action was taken only on a `` case-by-case basis'' and no blacklist was maintained, he said. <PERSON> Hulbert </PERSON> also said there was nothing illegal about having the companies pay money to improve minority hiring programs as part of any agreements for them to get back in the state's good graces.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s claims that it does not plan the highest-level of experiments at a proposed biological testing laboratory drew skepticism Wednesday from <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Bangerter </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bangerter </PERSON>, who toured the western desert installation's current biological test lab Wednesday, told reporters that officials had given him a different message than he received when he met with <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> representatives last month in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He said officials had told him then that `` there's a high likelihood they're going to be BL-4 -LRB- the highest level of biosafety containment -RRB-. If they really think they're going to do B-L4, that's what they ought to clear for,'' the governor said However, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> officials maintained Wednesday the proposed $ 5.3 million lab at Dugway Proving Ground had plans only for B-L3 experimentation. Dugway spokeswoman <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON> stressed that the new lab's mission would be defensive _ testing soldiers' protective gear against various biological agents `` The plan is to do B-L3 work. We're overbuilding for the added safety it gives us,'' she said, noting that the proposed facility would feature three pressurized labs and double-layered walls over 1,540 square feet. Dugway Director of Material Test Col. <PERSON> Wyett </PERSON> <PERSON> Colclasure </PERSON> said another reason for building the new lab complex to B-L4 guidelines was cost. While the project cost $ 600,000 more as a B-L4 than B-L3 complex, trying to upgrade the facility later would cost much more, he said. <PERSON> Colclasure </PERSON> did not say how much more, however. <PERSON> Colclasure </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s endeavors in biological testing made the project a neccessity. `` I believe the Soviets are working very diligently on a biological warfare capability. We must be sensitive to that,'' he said. The Army released an environmental impact statement on the lab complex in January, saying that construction and operation of the facility posed no danger to employees, the public at large or the environment. The present B-L2 level test facility at Dugway was established in 1952. Although it has been modified over the years, the facility has become inadequate for present-day testing needs because operators are unable to conduct the full range of tests required, officials said.

 Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> withdrew objections Wednesday to <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation of Army Maj. Gen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> to head the <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disarmament </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> in a move linked to the lawmaker's battle against the new U.S.-Soviet arms treaty. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> he never had any objectios to <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> or to his qualifications, which he said are `` excellent.'' The senator said he had delayed action on the Burns nomination in order to provide ammunition for his fight against the new Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty, which bans <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet missiles with ranges of 300 miles to 3,000 miles. He announced he has wrested a promise from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to promptly release two reports bearing on alleged Soviet violations of arms control treaties and the effectiveness of proposed verification of Soviet compliance with the new treaty. But <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> demanded the administration also prepare a third report _ confirming whether or not the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has violated the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty _ and make it available before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> acts on the INF pact. `` I would strenuously object to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> moving on this treaty until we get this information,'' <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> told reporters. `` I think the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would go off half-cocked if it had no capability to assess these violations. They would be simply swept under the rug in an atmosphere of euphoria.'' Complaining the administration has ignored a treaty provision calling for such a review of compliance every five years, <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> drafted legislation declaring the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` is violating the ABM treaty.'' He first offered it as an amendment to pending legislation restricting the use of lie detectors in private businesses, then withdrew it, saying he will offer it later if necessary. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> contended a review of Soviet compliance would require the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to protest `` at least one material breach of the ABM treaty by <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has long complained that the Soviets may be violating the ABM treaty by building a radar system at <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> in the central <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> made public an exchange of letters with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s national security adviser, in which the senator stated that <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> appears to be `` an excellent nominee.'' But he also complained that the arms control agency's failure to produce the three reports `` clouds the current hearings'' over the INF treaty. He said he has also `` received reports from witnessess that large quantities of documents were shredded late last week'' in <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disarmament </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> offices `` under investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and GA0.'' The Government Accounting Office is the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Replying for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> has given personal assurances he will cooperate fully with the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> investigations. But <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> did not comment on the alleged shredding of documents as such. He said the arms control agency's report on treaty violations will be sent to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on March 8 and that the report on treaty verification will be delivered March 14. But <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said the administration believes it has until next October before reviewing Soviet compliance with the terms of the ABM treaty. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> called that a `` ruse'' and said the review was required to be completed last Oct. 2. He said he believes the review has been delayed so as not to interfere with <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ratification of the INF pact. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> is currently principal deputy assistant secretary of state for politico-military affairs. He served for four years as the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s representative at the U.S.-Soviet negotiations on the INF treaty. He would succeed <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Adelman </PERSON>, who announced his intention to retire last July.

 The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> today voted 143-1 for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to submit to binding arbitration on whether it can shut down the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> observer mission. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> did not vote, and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> cast the only negative vote. Assembly resolutions are expressions of international will but are not legally binding and there is no mechanism to enforce them. They are often ignored or defied. Israeli Ambassador <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> is a terrorist group that has no place in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON> stalked out of the chamber when the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> representative, <PERSON> Zehdi </PERSON> <PERSON> Labib </PERSON> <PERSON> Terzi </PERSON>, said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s vote showed contempt for the world body and `` the norms of civilized behavior.'' Soviet Ambassador <PERSON> Aleksander </PERSON> <PERSON> Belonogov </PERSON> said in an interview after the voting that the dispute with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> was a `` self-inflicted wound'' on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> prestige and peace efforts in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. The assembly also voted 142-0 for a resolution asking the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in the Hague for a ruling on whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has the right to refuse arbitration. Neither <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> nor the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> voted on the measure. The arbitration would be conducted by an independent three-member panel, with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> each appointing one member and the third appointed jointly. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which has not yet moved to close the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> mission, said it considered the emergency meeting of the 159-nation assembly `` premature and unnecessary.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has rebuffed arbitration on the same grounds. `` It remains the intention of this government to find an appropriate resolution to this problem in light of the charter of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, the headquarters agreement and the laws of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Okun </PERSON> told the assembly after the vote. The resolutions were sponsored by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of `` lawlessness,'' several <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> allies and satellites, members of the movement of nations professing non-alliance with either superpower and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ally. The resolutions say closing the mission would violate the 1947 treaty under which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> became <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters. The pact provides for binding arbitration. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has non-voting, observer status in the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> and exercises considerable influence at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, which regards it as the only legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, many of whom live under Israeli occupation. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> mission, a four-story townhouse on <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s fashionable <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>, has a staff of three political officers and two secretaries Scores of organizations and nations, including most of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s closest allies, said during the three-day emergency session that closing the mission would undermine the independence of the world body Many said the move is further eroding the already diminished <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prestige at the world body. Others warned it could cripple <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> peace efforts in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> agrees with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> that the anti-terrorism legislation ordering the mission closed violates the headquarters agreement. But Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> reportedly said he plans to enforce the measure anyway. He is expected to announce his decision later this month. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> closed down the only other <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> office in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, an information office in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, in what turned out to be a futile attempt to forestall the legislation. Underlying the bitter confrontation over the mission is the nagging question of what the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> can do to achieve peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. The world body has repeatedly called an international peace conference that would include the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, among others. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which wants direct talks, and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, which refuses to deal with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, resist this plan. Several speakers in the assembly debate noted that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has never accused anyone accredited to the mission of terrorism or expelled anyone attached to the mission. In December, the assembly passed a resolution 145-1 asking the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> not to close the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> mission. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, which regards the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> as a terrorist group bent on the destruction of the Jewish state, cast the only negative vote.

 Two Scandinavian relief workers came home to the emotional embraces of their sobbing families on Wednesday and recounted their harrowing abduction in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and 25 days of fear and captivity. <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stening </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and Norwegian <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Jorgenson </PERSON> greeted their wives and children at a downtown <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> hotelslightly more 24 hours after being freed by their unknown kidnappers. <PERSON> Jorgenson </PERSON> said he feared he would die in the ordeal that began with his Feb. 5 abduction. `` My only thought was of my wife,'' said <PERSON> Jorgenson </PERSON>, pausing to collect himself as his daughter, <PERSON> Sessil </PERSON>, began crying. His wife, <PERSON> Gerd </PERSON>, and son, <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON>, also were at the news conference. Stening, 44, and <PERSON> Jorgenson </PERSON>, 58, were working with the Vienna-based <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relief </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> that cares for some 280,000 refugees in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> when they were kidnapped. <PERSON> Giorgio </PERSON> <PERSON> Giacomelli </PERSON>, head of the Vienna-based agency, <PERSON> Giacomelli </PERSON> said both men were in relatively good shape. `` It's the end of a very sad story, which luckily had a happy conclusion,'' <PERSON> Giacomelli </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Wednesday, a group called the <ORGANIZATION> Holy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warriors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility for the Jan. 27 kidnapping of West German engineer <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Schray </PERSON> and said it may release him soon. The claim was made in a typewritten Arabic statement from the group, which is believed to be headed by a brother of two men already linked to a 1985 hijacking and to the kidnappings. The statement was released to a Western news agency in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> along with a photograph of <LOCATION> Schray </LOCATION>. The picture showed a bearded Schray in blue jeans and a dark blue sweater looking directly at the camera. <PERSON> Giacomelli </PERSON> noted the other kidnap victims in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and said their plight tempered the happiness over the return of Stening and <PERSON> Jorgenson </PERSON>. Including Schray, there are 23 foreigners missing after being kidnapped in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since March 1985. They are nine Americans, four Frenchmen, three Britons, a West German, an Italian, an Irishman, an Indian and two unidentified men. The longest held hostage is American <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985. `` Our common joy does n't allow us to forget other colleagues who are still missing. We hope they will join us again soon,'' <PERSON> Giacomelli </PERSON> said. Among those missing is <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, who was abducted Feb. 17 in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. A statement released by the abductors, the Organization of the Oppressed on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s crackdown on <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> unrest in Israeli-occupied territories and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> trip of Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> `` make us more determined to try this criminal, <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>.'' Both the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have denied that <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, who served with the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force in <LOCATION> south </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, was a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> spy. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, 43, was abducted near south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s port of Tyre on Feb. 17. He heads a 76-man <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observer group that monitors truce violations on the <LOCATION> Lebanon-Israel </LOCATION> border under a 1949 armistice agreement. <PERSON> Stening </PERSON> said at a morning news conference in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> that four gunmen kidnapped the two <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> workers near south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s provincial capital of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> as they were driving from their base in the southern port of Tyre to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> The two men were moved to various locations in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The first word about the release of Stening and <PERSON> Jorgenson </PERSON> came in a handwritten Arabic statement delivered to a Western news agency in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> late Tuesday. The statement was accompanied by a picture showing the two men. It said `` after they were proved innocent, they were released.'' Most of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> relief group's services to the refugees were suspended after the abudctions. <PERSON> Giacomelli </PERSON> did not say if they would be resumed. At one point during his captivity, <PERSON> Jorgenson </PERSON> said he was convinced he and Stening would be killed when what looked like an explosive was brought into one of the rooms where they were held. <PERSON> Jorgenson </PERSON> said their clothes were cleaned and the two men were given a chance to wash the day before they were released. On Tuesday, with his new freedom, <PERSON> Jorgenson </PERSON> said he started smoking again. `` I'm a free man and I can cough when I want to,'' he quipped.

<HEAD>Diversion of Withheld Taxes by Employers is Growing, IRS Says</HEAD>

 A growing amount of tax money withheld from workers' paychecks is being misused by employers, often never finding its way to the government, the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. The total of these delinquent Social Security and income taxes rose by 49 percent from 1982 through 1987, to almost $ 3.73 billion, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wauben </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> assistant commissioner for collections. About 338,000 employers have failed to pay or account for that sum. Because withheld taxes account for 69 percent of all federal revenues, `` even a slight decline ... can have a devastating impact'' on the government, <PERSON> Wauben </PERSON> said at a news conference. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> also announced that although fewer individaul taxpayers are filing their returns early this year, the pace is picking up. Through Feb. 26, 30.2 million returns had been filed, down 4.9 percent from a year ago. But last week, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> received 6.7 million, up 3 percent from the same week in 1987. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> speculates that taxpayers are delaying filing this year because of all the changes caused by a sweeping tax revision enacted in 1986. The number of returns qualifying for refunds is down 4.5 percent, to 7.55 million this year, but the average refund has risen to $ 793, from $ 735 a year ago. <PERSON> Wauben </PERSON> said employers' failure to forward taxes withheld from workers' checks often is caused by ignorance of the law, although in some cases withheld taxes are kept out of greed. Often as not, he said, the problem is traced to a failing company's efforts to stay afloat. `` When employers find they are no longer able to keep their business operating on the cash available and they ... are unable to borrow from a bank or other lending institution, some begin using the funds withheld from their employees' wages as their own,'' <PERSON> Wauben </PERSON> said. Employers are required to turn over withheld taxes to the government at least once a quarter. Some big companies pay the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> every three days; most employers file these employment-tax returns weekly or biweekly. An employer's misdeed does not necessarily cause a problem for workers. Even though workers' withheld taxes might never be turned over to the government, their accounts will be credited by the government so long as they file an income tax return. The rise in delinquent withheld taxes is attributed to the fact that total payrolls and Social Security taxes have been increasing steadily. <PERSON> Wauben </PERSON> said there has been a disproportionate increase in areas of the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>, where oil prices and real estate values have dropped sharply. <PERSON> Wauben </PERSON> said a new <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> program aimed at another route of tax evasion has produced good results. This involves the practice of some employers of wrongly classifying some employees as independent contractors. That means the employer does not withheld Social Security and income taxes from these workers, although they are required to make quarterly estimated tax payments. But many such workers understate their earnings, and some do n't even file returns, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> says. During a two-year study in 26 areas of the nation, <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> collections officers audited 1,196 employers suspected of misclassifying workers as independent contractors. As a result, 9,004 delinquent quarterly employment-tax returns were filed and the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> hit 92 percent of the audited employers with tax bills averaging $ 3,000. Because of those findings, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> has assigned nearly 400 collections officers to concentrate on investigating similar cases.

<HEAD>Workers Strike Over Sandinista Economic Measures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYNA BRENNAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Construction workers stayed off the job throughout <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> for the third day Wednesday to demand higher wages and to protest the Sandinista government's new economic measures. The opposition <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Confederation </ORGANIZATION> said 4,000 workers had been on strike since Monday, paralyzing 53 construction projects nationwide. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said the strikes involved 600 workers at 12 work sites. The workers are demanding a 200 percent salary increase and an end to wage scales that are fixed for almost all jobs. Construction workers earn the equivalent of $ 412 a month. Apprentices make $ 266. `` These salaries do n't meet the basic food needs,'' said <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salgado </PERSON>, secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Confederation </ORGANIZATION>, in an interview. Citing runaway inflation, the government announced a series of economic measures Feb. 14. A new version of the currency, the cordoba, was issued and valued at 10 to the dollar. Prices set by the leftist government for most products soared. The old currency was fetching 20,000 to $ 1 on the legal exchange and more than 50,000 to the dollar on the black market. President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said the measures were intended to fight inflation, which he said was running at 1,300 percent. Unofficial estimates put the figure at 7,000 percent. Under a new wage scale, salaries range from the equivalent of $ 50 a month to $ 753. The price of a pound of meat rose from about $ 1 per pound to $ 3.50. Eggs went from just over $ 1 a dozen to $ 2.50. <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON>, regional director of work inspection for the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, called the construction workers' strike illegal. He said a legal strike requires a petition and naming of a special judge to determine the merits of the case. `` They want to boycott the economic measures, and while they stay on strike there is no negotiation,'' <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON> said. Strikes were illegal in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> under a state of emergency the government imposed in 1982, shortly after the war with the U.S.-backed Contras heated up. The restrictive measures were withdrawn in January as part of the government's compliance with a regional peace plan.

<TEXT>
 Threats against <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> may soon motivate the family to end a stalemate and begin cooperating with state prosecutors, according to a report published Wednesday. The family of the black <LOCATION> Wappingers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> teen-ager who claims she was kidnapped and sexually assaulted by six white men in November is increasingly concerned about her safety, the <ORGANIZATION> Poughkeepsie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, said, quoting an anonymous source said to be close to the family. On the advice of her lawyers, <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alton </PERSON> <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the family has thus far refused to cooperate with Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, whom Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> appointed as a special prosecutor. The lawyers want <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> ousted and a permanent special prosecutor named to investigate race-related crimes. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> and <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> did not immediately return telephone calls to their office Wednesday. The Rev. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> minister who has been advising the <LOCATION> Brawleys </LOCATION>, denied that the family was on the verge of cooperating with authorities and refused to comment on reports there had been threats against Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> confirmed that he had taken Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> from the home of <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Strong </PERSON>, the uncle with whom she had been staying since the attack. He would not say where Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> was staying. A woman who answered the phone at the <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>'s house Wednesday said neither <PERSON> Glenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>, Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>'s mother, nor <PERSON> Juanita </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>, the girl's aunt, were available. She said the family had no comment. Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>, 16, was found wrapped in a garbage bag after being missing for four days last November. Excrement was smeared on her body and `` KKK'' and `` nigger'' were written in charcoal or black ink on her body. Strong had vowed to `` march <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> down to <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>' office'' if the stalemate did not end in the next few days, the Journal quoted the source as saying. Strong has been critical of the lawyers' handling of the case, according to several published reports A 23-member grand jury was empaneled Monday to investigate the case, and jurors heard an opening statement from <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> called the attorney general's participation Monday `` a good sign.'' The panel is not expected to hear evidence this week.

<HEAD>Social Democrats and Liberals Will Merge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The centrist Social Democrats and Liberals will unite on Thursday after a stormy courtship during which they ran as the Alliance in two elections but were proccupied with their own quarrels. The new Social and <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> hopes to end the dominance of the governing Conservatives and the socialist <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the main opposition. In a mail referendum, Social Democrats voted 18,722 to merge and 9,929 against, or slightly under 2-1. Liberals approved the union 46,376 to 6,365, or more than 7-1, said to the London-based <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, which counted the votes. Separate party conventions approved the merger last month. Only 55.5 percent of the 52,000 Social Democrats and 52.3 percent of the 90,000 Liberals voted. Protracted infighting over the merger had split both parties. Liberal leader <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Steel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Maclennan </PERSON>, the Social Democrat leader, toasted each other with champagne. Steel, who is expected to be elected leader of the new party, said he looked forward to `` success and the future.'' <PERSON> Maclennan </PERSON> described the vote as `` clinching.'' The party is to be officially launched Thursday. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, who resigned as Social Democrat leader in opposition to the union, had urged members to boycott the vote and called it a `` fiasco.'' He plans to continue the Social Democrats as a separate party. The two parties began the merger process after placing a distant third in last June's general election, won by Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s Conservatives.

<HEAD>Opponents Fail To File Delegate Slates, So Bush Picks Up 24 NY
Delegates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Republican presidential candidate <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> picked up 24 delegates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> this week by virtue of his opponents' failure to file delegate slates in eight of the state's congressional districts And successful challenges to non-Bush delegate slates in other districts, if upheld by the courts, could leave the vice president with at least two dozen other delegates running unopposed. The Board of Elections on Tuesday wiped two slates of delegates supporting <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> off the the April 19 primary ballot, one day after stripping the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> senator's slate and one backing <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> from the ballot. The petitions were rejected mainly because they did not contain the required 1,250 signatures of registered Republicans, or were signed by Republicans living outside the congressional district the petitions were filed for. While <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> slates remain on the ballot in 33 of the state's 34 congressional districts, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> will be able to field delegate slates in only 12 districts, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> in 11 and <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> in nine. Having delegate slates on the ballot is all-important in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> where registered Republicans will not vote for any of the candidates, but for the delegates who pledge to support them at the national convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. The candidates that the delegates back will be listed next to the delegates' names on this year's ballot. At stake in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> are 102 delegates, three from each congressional district. The Republican state committee will designate 34 other delegates after the primary. The vice president's campaign has managed to get 10 <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> slates knocked off the ballot, as well as six slates supporting <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> and five backing <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>. Decisions disqualifying nominating petitions can be appealed to state courts, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> opponents say they will pursue that course in most cases. Meanwhile, in the early round of the <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> caucuses, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> gained one delegate while another remains uncommitted. Caucuses in the state continue through Saturday.

<HEAD>Homosexual Prostitute Acquitted of Selling AIDS-Tainted Blood</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A mentally ill prostitute who sold his blood even though he is infected with AIDS was acquitted Wednesday of charges of attempted poisoning. Jurors said they had decided that <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Markowski </PERSON> lacked the intent required for a conviction under state law, frustrating prosecutors who said the 29-year-old drifter `` can go out and do this again.'' `` What this has told us here today is that the law in the state of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> does not make it a crime to sell AIDS-contaminated blood. And that's unfortunate,'' said <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Attorney </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ira </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reiner </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Markowski </PERSON>, a homosexual prostitute who has tested positive for the AIDS virus, nodded to his attorney, <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, as the jury found him innocent of two counts of attempted poisoning. He had been accused of selling his tainted blood for $ 10 to <ORGANIZATION> Plasma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Production </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> last June 22 and of trying to do so again June 25. One of the ways AIDS can be spread is by transfusion of infected blood or blood products. He would have faced up to seven years in prison if convicted. `` I'm delighted and I'm a little surprised'' by the verdict, said <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, who had argued that <PERSON> Markowski </PERSON>, homeless and destitute, had sold his blood in desperation. `` I was afraid the jury would n't have the courage to follow the letter of the law. I thought the fear of AIDS ... would preoccupy the jury.'' <PERSON> Markowski </PERSON>, originally from <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, was first arrested June 23 after screaming, `` Kill me! Kill me! I have AIDS!'' in a <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> bank while attempting to grab a security guard's gun. Police found on him a receipt for the plasma center. Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barreto </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> argued at trial that <PERSON> Markowski </PERSON> knew his blood was tainted. He said the drifter sold it knowing it might contaminate the plasma pool but did n't care. Juror <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> of Echo Park said that even though <PERSON> Markowski </PERSON> knew what he was doing, he was doing it for money, not to poison. `` Right now you have to prove specific intent. You have to be able to prove that a person went down there willfully to poison the supply. That was not the case in this case,'' <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> said. `` The legislature has been sitting on their duff in this area for some time,'' said <PERSON> Barreto </PERSON>. `` We need legislation on this. He can go out and do this again today, as long as he said ` I just did it for the money.''' Prosecutors tried last year to have a law passed that would make it a felony to knowingly sell or donate AIDS-contaminated blood. The Assembly failed to approve it, and <PERSON> Reiner </PERSON> said he will push for it again this year. `` Mr. <PERSON> Markowski </PERSON> is today free to do what he did when he was arrested for the crime,'' <PERSON> Reiner </PERSON> said. `` Will he do it again? Perhaps. All he needs to do now is adopt an alias.'' <PERSON> Markowski </PERSON> had allegedly admitted to police that he sold his blood because he needed money and did n't care about the public, but Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Coen </PERSON> ruled the statement inadmissible because police had not read <PERSON> Markowski </PERSON> his rights to remain silent and wait for an attorney. The detective who interrogated <PERSON> Markowski </PERSON> said he committed the error because he was so shocked by what <PERSON> Markowski </PERSON> had done. Deliberations began Monday after a 10-day trial before <PERSON> Coen </PERSON>. Jurors returned the verdict Tuesday after deliberating for seven hours, but it was sealed until Wednesday because <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> was unable to make it to court. <PERSON> Reiner </PERSON> originally charged <PERSON> Markowski </PERSON> with attempted murder. But <PERSON> Coen </PERSON> dismissed those counts, saying the law required a specific intent to kill that was not present. <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said <PERSON> Markowski </PERSON> suffers from mental illness and carries the AIDS virus but has not developed the disease. The attorney said <PERSON> Markowski </PERSON> will be placed in a halfway house. `` The long-term prognosis at this point is not good. I'd say the outlook is guarded,'' he said.

<HEAD>Home Sales, Factory Orders Down in January</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By the Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Here, at a glance, are developments in the economic picture Wednesday:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>HOME SALES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 New home sales fell 9 percent in January. Sales activity was the slowest since the last recession ended in December 1982. Analysts were surprised by the decline, since sales had already fallen 6.8 percent in December and 3.4 percent in November. The sales downturn was accompanied by a sharp rise in prices. The median price of a home shot up 9.7 percent to $ 120,000.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>FACTORY ORDERS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Orders to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories for manufactured goods fell 0.6 percent in January, the first decline in five months. Orders for both durable and non-durable goods dropped to a seasonally adjusted $ 212.6 billion following a big 2 percent increase in December. It was the first setback in orders since a 1.4 percent drop in August, but economists said it showed a return to more normal demand following the placement of several large orders for jet aircraft in December.

<HEAD>U.S. STOCK MARKET</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The stock market settled for a small gain after a broad early advance faded. The Dow Jones average, up about 15 points at its best level of the day, finished with a .83 gain at 2,071.29.

<HEAD>JAPAN STOCK MARKET</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> surged closer to pre-crash levels. The Nikkei stock average closed at 25,682.82 points, up 246.92 points, or 0.97 percent from Tuesday's close. Before the October crash, the index stood at 25,746.56. Volume in the first period of trading was 1.7 billion shares, a record high for this year.

 In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar gained against the British pound when the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> sold pounds to keep the British currency below 3.0 West German marks as the mark fell against the dollar. At the end of the day, one pound cost $ 1.7680, cheaper than $ 1.7775 late Tuesday. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar closed at 128.47 Japanese yen, up from 128.30 Tuesday.

Then they learned they had n't won a thing. `` I guess it seems like we're a couple of country hicks,'' said Mrs. Work. `` We'd made all kinds of plans. I do n't know what we're going to do now. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Purchasing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, a company based in the <LOCATION> Pacoima </LOCATION> district of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> that sponsored the sweepstakes, said Mrs. Work has not won anything _ at least not yet. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it had received complaints about the company and had forwarded them to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> for investigation. A man who answered the telephone at a <ORGANIZATION> USPE </ORGANIZATION> telephone number said the sweepstakes is still in progress and that Mrs. Work is one of thousands with a chance at the top prize, said to be more than $ 2 million. The man would not give his name and would not respond to other questions. Mrs. Work is not the first person to be confused by the sweepstakes. Debra Long of <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, woman told reporters she recently quit her job and vacationed in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vagas </LOCATION> before learning she had not won $ 1.7 million, as she thought. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Flitcraft </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Chardon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, truck driver, said he thought he had won the contest after receiving a letter from the company on Monday. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlin </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Loeb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Loeb </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> law firm representing <ORGANIZATION> USPE </ORGANIZATION>, issued a statement that disputed the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> woman's claim but did not comment on Mrs. <PERSON> Work </PERSON>'s claims. `` It is been reported that a prize in excess of $ 1 million was won by Miss Debra Long of <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, in a sweepstakes sponsored by <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Purchasing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Carlin </PERSON>'s statement said `` Miss Long reported that she was notified by a certified letter from the company and she subsequently confirmed her winnings in a telephone conversation to the company on Feb. 15, President's Day. `` It appears that Miss Long is involved in a trick or hoax perpetrated by unknown parties, because the company does not notify winners by certified mail, the company's offices were closed on President's Day, the company does not request bank account numbers from winners nor does it require the other information Miss Long claims was requested of her.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Work </PERSON> said the company also had requested her bank account numbers. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Eppstein </PERSON>, president of the Toledo chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> Better </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, said the bureau has received at least 20 complaints about <ORGANIZATION> USPE </ORGANIZATION>'s contest over the last few years. `` The mail is just chock-full of these kinds of sweepstakes,'' <PERSON> Eppstein </PERSON> said. `` And they are so ... worded that some people think they have won something when they have not.'' `` We have received a lot of complaints about the company, mostly from people who had not received merchandise they ordered from the company,'' said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Russo </PERSON>, occupational support specialist with the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Postal Service in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Plottner </PERSON> of the regional office of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> declined comment on whether the agency is investigating <ORGANIZATION> USPE </ORGANIZATION>. Mrs. Work, who lives in <LOCATION> Stony </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION>, 10 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>, said she she received a letter from the company in October that read: `` We are pleased to inform you that you have been designated to receive certified bank checks from the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Purchasing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> for $ 1,894,876 ... your winnings in our multimillion dollar sweepstakes when you are the grand prize winner.'' A few weeks later, another said her winnings stood at $ 2,024,464. Then she received what she thought were two checks: one for $ 2 million and one for $ 24,000. She was asked to endorse them and send them back to the company along with her <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> and bank account numbers. At that point, the Works thought they were millionaires. However, the company's mailing said, `` Certified bank check for this amount ... will be drawn and issued to <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Work </PERSON> upon verification that the <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Work </PERSON> entry has been selected by the independent judging organization as the prize-winner in accordance to the rules and regulations set forth and established.'' The mailed material does not indicate when the sweepstakes winner will be announced, Mrs. <PERSON> Work </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Work </PERSON>, who has three children and runs the Country Girl beauty salon in her home, said she planned to close her business and her husband considered quitting his job as a crew chief at <ORGANIZATION> Manville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Waterville </LOCATION>. `` It does n't look good, but I'm happy inside,'' she said. `` I know good is going to come to pass.''

 A bill to require licensing of restaurant reviewers has been introduced in the Legislature after an owner complained that her establishment was savaged by a critic who did n't know a Bolognese sauce from bottled tomato sauce. Lawmakers give the measure little chance of passage because of concerns that it would violate the First Amendment right of free speech. However, the restaurant industry says debate over the bill helped accomplish its main purpose. `` We wanted to provide a message to reviewers, the public and some editorial people that ... some of the persons providing the reviews are less than capable,'' <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, executive vice president of the 700-member <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Restaurant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> persuaded lawmakers to draft the bill after <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> Trzcinski </PERSON>, co-owner of <LOCATION> Casagrande </LOCATION> restaurant in <LOCATION> Wallingford </LOCATION>, complained that two `` grossly inaccurate'' reviews last month caused her business to drop 15-20 percent. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said he gets a dozen complaints a year from restaurant owners about reviews. No state licenses restaurant critics, he said. `` We have to stand helplessly by while people are allowed to make unfounded, unsubstantiated and gratuitous remarks,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Trzcinski </PERSON> told a legislative committee Tuesday. `` The damage that these reviews do numbers in the millions of dollars. It is our business and it is our livelihood.'' <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Neigher </PERSON>, an attorney who specializes in media law, called the proposal `` preposterous.'' `` It's nothing more than a temper tantrum by some lobbyists and their clients who do n't have an elementary understanding of what the role of free speech in a free economy is about,'' <PERSON> Neigher </PERSON> said. `` The courts have repeatedly struck down attempts to license the press.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Trzcinski </PERSON>, who has operated <PERSON> Casagrande </PERSON> with her husband for 11 years, said her restaurant previously received high marks from some of the toughest critics in the state for its northern Italian cuisine. She complained that two recent reviewers made numerous mistakes, even when praising aspects of her menu. One mistook a fine loin of veal for a veal pattie and complained about her bagna cauda, an elegant oil-and-anchovy dip, because he was expecting a more pedestrian dip, she said. Another incorrectly suggested that her Bolognese sauce was tomato based and flavored with cheese, when it's actually a pork sauce flavored with a little tomato, Mrs. <PERSON> Trzcinski </PERSON> said. `` I would say he probably could n't recognize a proper Bolognese because he's familiar with Ragu,'' she said. The reviewer also made an ethnic joke about the restaurant's having a Polish chef, she said The reviewer, who uses the pen name <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> in restaurant reviews for the New Haven Register, said he thought his review was `` fairly positive'' and blamed the dispute over the Bolognese sauce on semantics and misinformation supplied by a waitress. `` Licensing opinions is kind of silly,'' said <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>, who has been reviewing restaurants for seven or eight years. Neither he nor the New Haven Register would reveal his real name. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Mokrisky </PERSON>, an attorney and the part-time food critic who complained about the bagna cauda, defended his opinion. `` I call'em the way I see'em,'' said <PERSON> Mokrisky </PERSON>, who calls himself a `` food fanatic.'' Under the proposal, restaurant critics would have to be licensed through the Department of Consumer Protection. A critic could be fined $ 500 for reviewing without a license. The proposed license requirements include experience in food-service operation and management, graduation from a recognized culinary arts degree program, or a combination of at least six years of experience and formal training. `` I have sympathy for her,'' said Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, co-chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that held a public hearing on the bill. `` But I just was not convinced it was a serious enough problem that we as a legislature ought to regulate it.''

 A farmer-lawmaker is hoping his colleagues will hop to it and approve a bill that would give a tax break to frog farmers. Farms for frogs should be exempt from local property taxes, just like any other place that has `` livestock,'' Conservative <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Colvin </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> committee studying a local finance bill. As now written, the bill defines livestock as `` any mammal or bird kept for the production of food or wool, or for the purpose of its use in the farming of land.'' That's fine for mammals and birds, but where does the frog, an amphibian, fit in? asked <PERSON> Colvin </PERSON>. `` The definition of livestock is most unclear. Times have changed in agriculture,'' he said, suggesting that the bill substitute `` creatures'' for `` livestock.'' `` It would be a sad day if any government started imposing a tax on frogs,'' said <PERSON> Colvin </PERSON>.

 Ballet fans beware: A <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> legislator is trying to make the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> Swing, a space-saving variant of the jitterbug, the official state dance. Under state Sen. <PERSON> Quentin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON>'s bill, the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swing </ORGANIZATION> would join the ranks of gold, serpentine rocks, the desert tortoise, dog-faced butterfly and the saber-toothed tiger _ all officially recognized symbols of the Golden State. Gold is the state mineral, serpentine the state rock, desert tortoise the state reptile, dog-faced butterfly the state insect and the saber-toothed tiger the state fossil. `` West Coast Swing is an intricate dance, requiring a great deal of coordination, good timing and intelligent application,'' <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> independent, wrote to fellow lawmakers recently. According to <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON>, who approached <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON> with the idea of honoring the dance, <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swing </ORGANIZATION> is a variation of the jitterbug, a jazz dance. The variation was developed because it takes up less room than the freewheeling jitterbug, and thus more couples can dance on a smaller floor, said <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON>. `` It's a very complex, very beautiful dance,'' said <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON>, legislative liaison director for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>.

 More than 60 anti-apartheid demonstrators were arrested Wednesday following a peaceful protest in front of the South African embassy. The arrests followed a rally protesting the South African government's decision to outlaw public dissent, which led to the arrest last week of Nobel Peace Prize winner Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, a leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> which has organized similar protests at the South African embassy since 1984, told a crowd of about 300 people that the demonstration marked `` the beginning of a new phase of the battle against apartheid.'' The rally was held down the street from the embassy to avoid violation of a <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> ordinance prohibiting demonstrations within 500 feet of foreign embassies.

 Prodded by the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, pharmaceutical companies agreed Wednesday to avoid any advertising that claims aspirin can help prevent a first heart attack, despite a report in a medical journal that drew this conclusion. <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> announced the agreement after he met for more than an hour with company representatives who came to his office in this <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> suburb after he sent a letter reminding of the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s power to regulate. At a news conference, <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said he had told the manufacturers that if they promoted their products for a use not supported by an <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> analysis, they could be guilty of mislabeling, and `` this mislabeling can lead to regulatory action by the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>.'' He said the manufacturers agreed to `` exercise voluntary restraint'' and to refrain `` from further promotion'' of aspirin as a protection against first heart attack. But <PERSON> Young </PERSON> insisted that the action was not in response to ads that already have run. The commissioner said he was `` so busy'' in his job that he never read, listened or watched advertising and thus did not know if any ads run that violated the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> position have been run. He also said that no one had brought such ads to his attention. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> MacLeod </PERSON>, director of consumer protection at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which regulates drug advertising, refused repeatedly at the news conference to say if his agency had taken any action regarding ads by aspirin manufacturers. Nor would he confirm that inappropriate ads had been run. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said the meeting was prompted by the publicity surrounding a study published Jan. 28 in the New England Journal of Medicine. In the study, more than 11,000 physicians over the age of 40 took one aspirin every other day, while another group of physicians took placebos, or fake aspirin. At the end of 57 months, the study showed that those taking aspirin had a 47 percent fewer heart attacks. While refusing to say if the action was prompted by any ad that has run, <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said the drug manufacturers had agreed to voluntarily `` refrain from further promotion of the study results.'' In a Feb. 24 letter, <PERSON> Young </PERSON> `` invited'' the drug manufacturers to attend a meeting at his <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> office to discuss the aspirin findings. He wrote of his concern that `` the dissemination of certain types of information is clearly premature'' until the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> has analyzed the aspirin study and established `` appropriate'' labeling for use of the over-the-counter medication for the prevention of first heart attacks. The invitation letter also cited the federal law that forbids mislabeling of drugs. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said he told the manufacturers that all ads making any claims for uses of aspirin not approved by the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> were to be halted. `` From this time forward, any ads in the pipeline will not be grandfathered -LRB- escape enforcement -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. Both Young and <PERSON> McLeod </PERSON> repeatedly declined to say if any advertising was being canceled as a result of the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> action, and the agerncy did not identify the drug manufacturers attending the meeting. Most of those leaving the private meeting refused comment. An exception was Dr. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Squibb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceutical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION>, who would say only, `` We're all in agreement. It was a very good meeting.'' <PERSON> Marie-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Stockl </PERSON>, public affairs director for Bristol-Myers, said in a statement later: `` We agree with the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> that the final results need to be reviewed by the agency before communicating the use of aspirin for primary heart attack, and our actions to date have been consistent with that position.'' Several drug companies have produced ads that promoted the use of aspirin to help prevent a second heart attack. These were based on a 1985 study that was analyzed by the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>. This earlier study has been incorporated in the agency's professional labeling statement on aspirin. But the study announced in January was the first to show evidence that aspirin could help prevent a primary, or first, heart attack. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said his concern is that the aspirin study involved a narrow group _ all physicians in good health _ and that an analysis of the study had not been completed. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said the aspirin therapy is not appropriate for everyone and `` could do more harm than good'' for some. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said the study showed that some subjects experienced stroke. He also said the aspirin therapy could harm the health of people with high blood pressure, gout, kidney or liver disease or peptic ulcer. Aspirin also can cause intestinal bleeding, he said. `` This study used a healthy population of phsycians who could take their own blood pressure and who knew how to recognize intestinal bleeding,'' said <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, and widespread use by patients without medical supervision could lead to serious complications. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said it will take about six months for the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> to analyze the study and then publish new professional labeling for aspirin.

 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> will comply with a court order and withhold profit-sharing checks scheduled to go to about 1,850 workers who are behind on child support payments, the automaker said Wednesday. `` We're not a stakeholder in this. It's strictly between the individuals involved and <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Moran </PERSON>. The order was issued by Circuit Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON> on Tuesday, four days after Friend of the Court of <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> filed suit to obtain profit-sharing money in an effort to improve child support collection. Friend of the Court, which is involved with domestic relations cases and is affiliated with <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, `` has an obligation to insure compliance with child support orders,'' said its director, <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritsema </PERSON>. The checks are to be distributed Tuesday and are expected to average a record $ 3,700. More than 160,000 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> employees received the previous record profit-sharing checks of $ 2,100 in 1986. According to the court order, Friend of the Court will have eight weeks to settle the 1,850 cases. <PERSON> Ritsema </PERSON> said eight weeks would be sufficient for <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s 35 <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judges to decide how much of each profit-sharing check will be given to the agency, adding that he hoped some people would opt to settle without a hearing About $ 155 million in child support was collected in 1987, but 80 percent of the 225,000 parents supposedly paying child support are in arrears, <PERSON> Ritsema </PERSON> said. He said the agency's action against <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> employees could bring in as much as $ 4 million. <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON>'s action disappointed many <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> workers. Four employees told the judge that child support already is being deducted from their pay. They said the agency should increase the deduction from their regular paychecks instead of going after their profit-sharing checks. `` The profit-sharing check is what we've realized after going eight years without a raise and turning <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> around,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a 10-year <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> employee. Friend of the Court is considering increasing the amount deducted from regular paychecks, <PERSON> Ritsema </PERSON> said. But he said any such action would be in addition to pursuing profit-sharing money. Friend of the Court in <LOCATION> Washtenaw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> has also moved to obtain profit-sharing money from <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> workers who are behind on child support payments, <PERSON> Moran </PERSON> said. He added that <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> has rejected all 150 names on a list submitted by the southeastern <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> county agency, saying that not enough data was supplied for the automaker to verify the agency's claims.

<HEAD>Army Stops Random Drug Testing of Civilians, But Seeks Appeal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it had stopped random drug testing for civilian workers to comply with a court ruling, but was asking the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to appeal the judgment. The service, in a brief statement, said it would limit its civilian drug testing for the time being to those instances in which `` there is a reasonable suspicion that a specific employee is under the influence of drugs while on duty.'' Testing on a random basis, however, has been halted for now, the service added. The move follows a decision in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Tuesday in which a judge ruled that random drug testing amounted to an unreasonable search prohibited by the Constitution. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> said random checks of employees in so-called sensitive positions could not be justified by safety concerns, because the urine test used by the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> did not indicate whether an employee was using drugs on the job. `` The Army has asked the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> to appeal the ruling,'' the service said in its statement. `` The Army has also requested that Justice ask for a stay of the judge's order during the appeal process.'' <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON>'s ruling had no effect on the right of the armed forces to conduct random drug tests of active-duty personnel.

 <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday it should consider trimming Social Security and other entitlement programs as it searches for ways to reduce the federal budget deficit. Saying that such guaranteed-benefit programs `` account for nearly half of total outlays,'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> held out little hope for major deficit reductions in other areas _ although he did propose a 15-cent gasoline tax. `` Several rounds of deficit-reduction efforts already have taken care of the easy cuts,'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which is considering President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s $ 1.09 trillion budget request for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said entitlement expenses, which include Social Security, <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>, Medicaid and various forms of welfare, will rise dramatically in the early 21st century because of the `` increase in the beneficiary population.'' Sen. <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>, D-N.D., told <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>: `` Baby boomers are going to be in for a big surprise when it's time for them to start collecting Social Security.'' Baby boomers is the phrase given to the bulge in population from those born after World War II and into the mid-1960s. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, who as a private citizen chaired a bipartisan commission that helped overhaul Social Security financing in the early part of this decade, did not specify exactly which programs he would cut. But he said the effect of cuts in entitlement programs made now would be amplfied in years to come. He noted that some 38 million Americans, or about 15 percent of the poplulation, `` are collecting Social Security retirmenet or disability benefits.'' Despite the political problems associated with trimming benefit programs such as Social Security, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> told the committee: `` All the alternatives are known. The choices are political, not economic.'' `` I wish you well. And I do n't think you need me to tell you how to go about it,'' he said. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has projected a fiscal 1988 budget deficit of $ 146.74 billion. The <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, however, says it's likely to be about $ 157 billion, substantially above the $ 144 billion target called for in the Gramm-Rudman budget-balancing law. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s budget recommendations for 1989 projects a 1989 deficit of $ 129.5 billion. Social Security spending is projected to reach $ 214.7 billion for the year, compared with $ 202.4 billion for 1987. Other Health and Human Services programs, including <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> and Medicaid, spent $ 50.51 billion in the first four months of 1988, compared with $ 49.43 billion in the same period of 1987. Interest payments on the $ 2.2 trillion national debt are expected to total $ 210.06 billion in fiscal 1988, accounting for 20 percent of total federal spending. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> suggested that not much more could be expected in the way of deficit reduction from further defense cuts or general tax increases. Defense spending is approaching `` maintenance levels,'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said. And, as to new taxes, he testifed, `` there are upside limits to the share of income that can be taxed.'' `` For several decades, the overall federal tax bite has been fairly flat, at a bit less than 20 percent of gross national product. ... This stability is not a coinicidence but is indicative of the public's aversion to rising tax burdens.'' However, he suggested that a new 15-cent-a-gallon levy on gasoline prices would help ease the deficit in a small way, and might even promote more energy conservation. In other testimony, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said: _ Even if the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> wanted to drive down interest rates sharply at this time, `` we would find we would fail,'' because markets would likely resist such a move and `` would run away from us. _ Trade deficit improvements, led by higher import prices and surging exports, would continue even at current exchange-rate levels of the dollar _ There was some danger of increased inflation in the coming months, but higher prices do `` not appear to be on the order of a magnitude that should cause concern. _ `` There are no secret agreements'' among industrial nations involving interest rate levels in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that might be needed to support the goal of a stabilizing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar at its current rate of exchange.

 <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> wants to drop his libel suit against a former congressman who questioned his war record because going to trial now would `` sacrifice his presidential campaign,'' his lawyer said Wednesday. But <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s accuser declared, `` He's chickening out of the trial just like he chickened out 37 years ago. Former Rep. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON>, R-Calif., who has accused <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> of using his father's political influence to avoid combat duty in the Korean War, has said in recent weeks he would n't settle the suit unless <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> paid the costs, which <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON> estimates at $ 400,000, of defending against the suit The trial, set to begin on Tuesday, when <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> hopes to do well in delegate-rich Southern primaries, would force him off the campaign trail for three weeks, attorney <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Rigler </PERSON> said. In dropping the lawsuit `` <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> does not intend to back away at any time from his denial of the charges that Mr. <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON> made,'' <PERSON> Rigler </PERSON> said. He said that `` it is quite possible that Mr. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> will be asked to pay a substantial amount of court costs'' to cover the expenses of taking depositions from more than 50 witnesses. But <PERSON> Rigler </PERSON> said he would likely appeal any such decision by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Hens </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>. He also suggested the $ 400,000 defense estimate of costs `` may be an artificial figure'' that includes lawyers' fees that <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> should not have to pay. <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehner </PERSON>, said that, if anything, the defense estimate of its costs is `` artificially low.'' <PERSON> Lehner </PERSON> said he will ask the judge to order <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> to go to trial on Tuesday or force him to pay court costs as well as attorneys' fees. <PERSON> Rigler </PERSON> said <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> will ask dismissal of the lawsuit because `` he is being asked to sacrifice his presidential campaign in order to vindicate his personal honor.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, said Wednesday he wanted to press ahead with the suit but could n't be in court and out campaigning for the Republican presidential nomination at the same time. `` If the judge will give me about another month, I'd love to go into it,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said. The judge in January refused <PERSON> Roberton </PERSON>'s request to postpone the trial until June 20. `` I ca n't understand why a respected judge did it,'' <PERSON> Rigler </PERSON> said. `` We think it is unfair.'' Under rules of civil procedure, a plaintiff can not drop a case without the defendant's consent once the lawsuit has been answered or without a court order dismissing the case. <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON>, commenting Wednesday on <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` The courtroom's a great place to learn the truth. Now that he's up with the truth to be told and testimony under oath, he's backing off.'' `` I think the truth ought to be told. I do n't know any better place to get the truth than in the courtroom. He invoked the process, he ought to go through with it,'' <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON> said. The lawsuit was filed in 1986 following publication of <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON>'s allegations that <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> used the influence of his late father, Sen. <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, D-Va., to avoid combat duty in the Korean War <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON>, a decorated Marine combat veteran who was aboard a troop ship from which <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> was removed in 1951 during a stopover in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, also charged that <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> later served as the `` booze officer'' to a rear echelon unit after he did go to <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. A number of former Marines have come forward since the lawsuit was filed to support <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON>, though other witnesses deny that <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> invoked his father's political influence to be get his temporary reassignment to a special training unit in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON> said Wednesday that one reason he made the charges was that he feared a person who had avoided combat might try to make amends by becoming more warlike in later years. `` When you get a president in office who has evaded combat in his youth and all his advisers are saying ` look tough against the Soviets' ... I think there is a tendency to try to prove your manhood late in life,'' he said. `` A man like <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> wants to take on the commies anywhere they are, anywhere in the world,'' <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON> said. It's `` a little dangerous to have a man like that in the White House.'' <PERSON> Rigler </PERSON> invited <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON> to submit the dispute over <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s war record to an independent arbitrator, saying, `` If he refuses to agree to arbitration, it is Mr. <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON> who is afraid to have a determination of the facts. <PERSON> Lehner </PERSON> said Tuesday that <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s attorneys rejected the idea of arbitration last fall when he informally suggested it.

 Fingerprints found in a book about poisons match those of a woman accused of killing her husband by putting cyanide in a non-prescription drug, according to court papers released Wednesday. A memorandum filed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Stella </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> had failed a lie-detector test `` on whether she was the Excedrin killer'' and that she apparently forged her husband's signature on life insurance applications Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> is charged in the deaths of <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>, 52, and <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Snow </PERSON>, 40, both of <LOCATION> Auburn </LOCATION>. Both died in June 1986 after swallowing tainted capsules of Extra-Strength Excedrin. Authorities have not suggested any other links between the victims. Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> was indicted in December on two counts of causing a death by product tampering and three counts of tampering with a product involved in interstate commerce. She has pleaded innocent. Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> checked out a book on poisoning from a library in mid-1984 without returning it, and pages on cyanide poisoning in a book titled `` Deadly Harvest'' that was found on a library shelf bore 84 fingerprints and three palm prints belonging to Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>, court documents said. The prosecutor's memo said the defendant and her husband, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>, had experienced `` intensified marital discord'' just before his death _ an assertion strongly disputed by Ms. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>'s court-appointed defense attorney In accompanying documents, federal public defender <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hillier </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> also disputed the government's claim that the polygraph test was conclusive. The maximum penalty on each death count is life, and the other charges carry maximum terms of 10 years. Trial has been set for April 18. The prosecutor's memo, filed in support of the government's motion that Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> remain in custody pending trial, and accompanying documents had been sealed by U.S. District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON> because of concern that release of the information might make it harder to obtain an unbiased jury The <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-Intelligencer </ORGANIZATION> and Morning News Tribune of <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION> appealed the order, which was overturned Monday by the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. Tainted capsules of pain relievers were found in both victims' homes and in bottles on the shelves of two stores in the suburbs between <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION> Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> had sued Excedrin's manufacturer, Bristol-Myers, and two stores where tainted capsules were found after an insurance carrier refused to pay benefits on her husband's death. Shortly before he died, <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> obtained a life insurance policy that would pay his wife $ 31,000 if he died of natural causes and $ 136,000 for an accidental death. In September and October 1985, Ms. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> applied for two other life insurance policies for a total of $ 40,000, with she and her husband each the beneficiary of the other. `` Handwriting examination has definitely concluded that <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> did not sign what purports to be his signature,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s memo says. `` <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>'s fingerprints were not found on either insurance application. `` <PERSON> Stella </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>'s fingerprints were found in one of the two applications, and handwriting analysis conclusively established that she signed her husband's name to one application and probably signed his name to the second application.''

 A state prosecutor and a former <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> human rights delegate from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> announced their defection Wednesday and accused the Sandinista government of torture, keeping political prisoners and rigging the judiciary. <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Villavicencio </PERSON> said he had been an appeals prosecutor in the district of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, the capital, since March 1983. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Miranda </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official for eight years, was an alternative representative at the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> during 1985-87 and said he left <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to avoid holding the same post this year. The two men called a news conference to announce their `` resignation,'' timed to coincide with the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> commission's annual session Both said they remained Sandinista supporters, but were disillusioned with the leftist government's `` deception'' of the Nicaraguan people. They said they moved to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where they have family and friends, in the last three months and would resign officially shortly. <LOCATION> Villavicencio </LOCATION> said Nicaraguan jails hold 8,600 political prisoners and said torture is used against peasants opposing government policies. He said a `` reprehensible permanent alliance'' exists between police and judicial authorities and judges are pressured to convict on the basis of fabricated charges. The government is pushing a pilot project to hand over the administration of justice to political commissars, he said. <PERSON> Miranda </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> is undergoing a `` Stalinist social drama.'' He said the Nicaraguan delegation at the <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in fact took instructions from delegates of allies, such as <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Provision Of Civil Procedure Spotlighted In Robertson Case</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Robertson-Libel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The decision by <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential hopeful <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> to seek dismissal of his libel suit against a congressman who questioned his war record calls into play an arcane provision of civil procedure in federal courts. Rule 41 governs the dismissal of lawsuits by plaintiffs once the defendant has answered the complaint. A plaintiff can obtain dismissal of the suit voluntarily if he gets a signed stipulation from the defendant. Without such a stipulation, as in <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s lawsuit against former Rep. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, R-Calif., the plaintiff can ask for a court-ordered dismissal <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s lawyers said Wednesday they will ask <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Hens </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> to order dismissal of the case under this provision which provides that the case can be dismissed `` upon order of the court and upon such terms and conditions as the court deems proper.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Rigler </PERSON>, said his client expects to be ordered to pay <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON>'s court costs to cover the expenses of taking depositions from witnesses. But <PERSON> Rigler </PERSON> said he does n't believe his client should pay such costs or attorney's fees and he would likely appeal such an order if it were made by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Hens </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>. <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehner </PERSON>, says the judge has the discretion to order <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> to pay both his client's court costs and attorney's fees. <PERSON> Lehner </PERSON> says if the judge refuses his request to go to trial on Tuesday, he will ask her to order <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> to pay both court costs and attorney's fees, which he says total more than $ 400,000. <PERSON> Rigler </PERSON> conceded that an award of attorney's fees is always a possibilty but he said <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s lawsuit does n't `` fall within that category of cases'' in which such an award is appropriate. Such cases includes lawsuits that are brought in bad faith or to harass the defendant. The judge has already refused to dismiss the case in <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON>'s motion to dismiss the case, ruling that <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> is entitled to go to trial on his charges that he was libeled by the former congressman <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> charges that <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON> defamed him by charging he used the political influence of his late father, Sen. <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, D-Va., to avoid combat during the Korean War

The Iraqis said they fired eight surface-to-surface missiles Wednesday, two of them into <LOCATION> Qom </LOCATION>, bringing the total for three days to 24. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said it hit <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> with three missiles, for a total of eight in the same period. `` Fear not,'' <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> told Iranians in remarks quoted by the official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. `` It does not make any difference for a people who seek martyrdom whether they are killed by missiles, tanks or artillery.'' Both sides reported civilian casualties in their capital cities, and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> warplanes also raided a village near <LOCATION> Rasht </LOCATION> 150 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said `` several civilians'' were killed Wednesday in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and bombs destroyed the mosque in the village. <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the Iranian rockets killed or wounded civilians and demolished houses and shops in residential neighborhoods of the Arab capital, but was not more specifics. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said Wednesday's hits on <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> wounded 15 people, bringing the total to 115. Before the general report about casualties in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, it had reported 27 killed in the capital and five in the village near <LOCATION> Rasht </LOCATION>. It said casualties included two newlyweds killed in the village and an 80-year-old woman wounded in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. Western military analysts believe <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> uses Soviet-made Scud-B missiles fitted with strap-on boosters enabling them to reach <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, which is 290 miles from the border. <LOCATION> Qom </LOCATION> is roughly the same distance from the frontier. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s weapons also are Scud-Bs, provided by its Arab allies <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, but without boosters because <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> is only 80 miles from the border. This week's attacks by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> are its first on <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and Qom with surface-to-surface missiles. President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s government declared in August it had acquired missiles that could reach the Iranian capital, a city of 6 million people. The Iraqi air force, which has an estimated 8-1 advantage over <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s, has made many raids on Iranian cities and bombed <LOCATION> Qom </LOCATION> repeatedly in January 1987. Thousands of civilian lives have been lost in the `` war of the cities,'' the periodic rounds of bombing and missile attacks in a conflict that has claimed at least 1 million casualties since it began in September l980. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said its artillery batteries, in response to the rocketing of <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, shelled military and economic installations in the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> cities of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ammara </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Badra </PERSON>, <PERSON> Zorbatiya </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharqi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Gharbi </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 A group of citizens asked for a ruling Wednesday on whether President <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s war record warrants murder charges, and <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> ordered the seizure of a magazine that published the complaint. The left-wing weekly Falter printed a text of the complaint by the 300 Austrians along with three articles critical of the president, who has been accused of committing war crimes while serving as a German army lieutenant in the <LOCATION> Balkans </LOCATION> during World War II. Under Article 63 of <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s Constitution, the president can not be prosecuted unless both houses of Parliament approve. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s office said he instructed the state prosecutor's office to impound copies of the magazine on grounds the issue damaged his honor Police said late Wednesday they had not yet received a judge's order to act <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> says he is innocent of war crimes. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Oswalt </PERSON>, a journalist and spokesman for the group making the complaint, said it was delivered to the prosecutor's office Wednesday morning. A spokesman for the office said privacy laws prevented him from confirming such a document was received. <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Litzka </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, said prosecutors must investigate any such complaint and tell the ministry whether there are grounds for legal action. As grounds for an investigation of possible charges, the complaint cited a law that says both those who commit crimes and those who assist in them can be held responsible for criminal acts. It quoted extensively from the report last month by an international panel of historians saying <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> was in `` close proximity'' to Nazi atrocities, knew of them and did nothing to stop them. The historians said they found no proof that the former <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general committed war crimes, but left the question of guilt open. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> has said the historians exonerated him from the accusations of war crimes which arose during the presidential election campaign two years ago. The complaint also quoted from an interview printed Feb. 25 by the <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Sueddeutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeitung </ORGANIZATION> with <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Messerschmidt </PERSON>, a West German historian who served on the panel. <PERSON> Messerschmidt </PERSON>, who has legal training, said steps could be considered in connection with <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s role in the fate of six British commandos executed by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> in 1944. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> ordered <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> authorities last month to reopen an investigation of the case. Israeli historian <PERSON> Yehuda </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> said Feb. 9 he thought the panel's report could serve as the basis of an investigation of whether to prosecute <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>.

<HEAD>National Lawyers Group Challenges Federal Sentencing Guidelines</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A national lawyers group Wednesday joined a challenge to federal sentencing guidelines that require judges to impose prison terms of particular lengths for certain crimes. The guidelines, established by a congressional commission, violate the Constitution's separation of powers doctrine, says a friend-of-the-court brief filed by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION>. The association joined a challenge filed by Assistant Federal Public Defender <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, who represents a woman with no criminal record who under the guidelines must receive at least 6 -LCB- years in prison for smuggling cocaine. A judge may go outside the guidelines, which create a 43-level system of punishment based on the crime and defendant's record, only in extreme cases. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION>, said all 15 federal judges in his district will rule together on the matter to avoid discrepancies from courtroom to courtroom. No hearing date has been set. It will be the first time the judges have sat together since they considered the immigration of 125,000 Cubans to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> during the 1980 Mariel boatlift. The sentencing guidelines have been challenged on constitutional grounds three times in the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> since Feb. 18 with different results, said <ORGANIZATION> NACDL </ORGANIZATION> representative <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weintraub </PERSON>. In the test case, <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogle </PERSON>, 21, was arrested after her arrival at <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> on Nov. 11 with 1.9 kilograms of cocaine she was carrying for someone else, <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said. `` She was not profiting from it,'' he said. `` She was doing it for a person she perceived to be a friend.'' Ms. <PERSON> Bogle </PERSON> pleaded guilty to importing cocaine and has been jailed while awaiting sentencing March 25. Under the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> set a minimum sentence of five years in prison for the offense. However, the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Sentencing Commission, created in 1984, set a guideline ranging from six years and seven months to eight years and one month in prison for the crime, <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said. The guidelines apply to crimes committed after Nov. 1. In Ms. <PERSON> Bogle </PERSON>'s case, the federal probation office wants to use the commission's guidelines, <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday chose <ORGANIZATION> R.H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> over a rival suitor, agreeing to a marriage that would put famous retailers such as <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION>'s and <PERSON> Bullock </PERSON>'s under one enormous corporate roof. A rejected <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said it would proceed with its bid for <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>, the nation's fifth largest retailer. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> said in a joint statement with <PERSON> Macy </PERSON>, the nation's 10th largest general retail concern, that the two companies had signed a definitive agreement to create a new company, <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> - <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> operates 96 stores in 14 states, while <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> has 650 stores _ including <ORGANIZATION> Bloomingdale </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bullocks </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Filene </ORGANIZATION>'s _ <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s choice of <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> over <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> came as no surprise. Analysts noted that the <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> bid offered <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> the opportunity for future growth, while <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> would bring with it a history of having bought and broken up <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. No matter who ends up controlling <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>, the new owner is expected to sell its <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circle </ORGANIZATION> discount stores and <ORGANIZATION> Ralphs </ORGANIZATION> supermarkets Several of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s department store chains, which include <PERSON> Burdine </PERSON>'s, I. <PERSON> Magnin </PERSON>., <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>'s, <ORGANIZATION> Abraham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Straus </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON>, also are expected to be sold after a purchase by either <PERSON> Macy </PERSON> or <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> and <PERSON> Straus </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>'s were considered likely candidates for a sale by <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION>, because they are direct competitors with <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> stores in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, respectively. The agreement provides for <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> to begin a cash tender offer of $ 74.50 a share for about 80 percent of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s 89.6 million outstanding shares, or a total of $ 5.25 billion, the companies said. The remaining <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> shares would be exchanged for stock in the new company. <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s current management would have a strong voice in the new company, filling 40 percent of the seats on its board of directors. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>, a Toronto-based real estate developer and retailer, through its <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> division, owns the <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marsh </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>'s, <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Maas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> chains. The retailer said in a statement that <PERSON> Macy </PERSON>'s bid was `` not competitive and we intend to prevail in the marketplace.'' Late Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> said it was amending its previously announced $ 66 cash tender offer. It said it would pay $ 75 per share in cash for 80 percent of <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s shares, and after a merger would pay $ 44 per share for the remaining 20 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> said its latest proposal, which was to expire March 15, had a combined value of $ 68 per share and a total value of $ 6.1 billion. The amended <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> bid was announced after the close of trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> stock fell $ 1 a share to $ 66.75. Earlier, <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> repeated a charge that the <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> offer was highly speculative because of the unknown value of the stock. Macy is currently privately held, and it is difficult to know how much its shares are worth. Wall Street analysts said they found it hard to predict what shareholders would do, given the problem of putting a value on the stock portion of the offer. `` If you do n't know that, it's really tough to figure out which is a better deal,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ronning </PERSON>, a retail industry analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harriman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> bid, which came to light Monday, was originally for $ 73.80 a share in cash plus stock, but the offer was increased before the agreement was reached <PERSON> Macy </PERSON> was taken private by a management group in a $ 3.6 billion leveraged buyout in 1986. Its stores rang up $ 5.21 billion in sales during the fiscal year ended last Aug. 1. Federated Chairman <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldfeder </PERSON> said at a news conference Wednesday he would resign after helping <ORGANIZATION> Macy </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Finkelstein </PERSON> implement the merger. <PERSON> Goldfeder </PERSON> said he expects to be paid $ 3.06 million when he leaves the company under a `` golden parachute'' approved by <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s directors. Similar departure payments are due other top <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> officers. The nation's four largest retailers are <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, with $ 30.21 billion in sales during fiscal 1987; <ORGANIZATION> K </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, $ 25.63 billion; <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, $ 15.96 billion, and <ORGANIZATION> J.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> _ $ 13.98 billion.

 Federal regulators' failure to require <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to make public reports of sudden acceleration in <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> 5000 cars appears to be a case of intentional deception, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> congressman said Wednesday. Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Hochbrueckner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, in letter to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION>, demanded the documents be turned over to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, bypassing the agency responsible for the <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> investigation. `` As a result of <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION>'s apparent cooperation with -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, the public has been denied the opportunity to study significant evidence which might highlight the ineffectiveness of a shift-lock device in the <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> 5000 to curtail sudden acceleration incidents,'' <PERSON> Hochbrueckner </PERSON> wrote. `` I find this deceptive behavior a shocking departure from the established practices in these matters.'' <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> in January 1987 ordered a recall of 255,336 1978-86 <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> 5000s for installation of a device to fix reported throttle problems on the cars. The agency has received 1,750 complaints of alleged sudden acceleration in <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> 5000s, resulting in 1,269 accidents, 430 injuries and five deaths. <PERSON> Hochbrueckner </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> requested the incident reports in June 1987. However, the documents were never turned over to <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION>, which instead received summaries from <ORGANIZATION> VW </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Hochbrueckner </PERSON> said, calling the arrangement unprecedented. <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement in response saying that `` <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> has not given us any special concessions, neither have we been relieved of any of the burden of responding to the agencies' requests for information. A <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> memorandum filed in the <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> case said that at <ORGANIZATION> VW </ORGANIZATION>'s request, `` the source documents were reviewed by -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- personnel and the summaries were found to be accurate summations of the very bulky source documents. An <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> official said Wednesday there had been other instances in which the agency had requested summaries of complaints rather than the complaints themselves. The official, speaking only on condition he not be named, was unable to say how common the practice was. <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION>'s spokesman at its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Troy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, did not return calls for comment. <PERSON> Hochbrueckner </PERSON> asked <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> to give <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> all the owner reports, consumer complaints, surveys, investigations, field reports or other sources `` received or authorized by <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION>, or of which <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> is otherwise aware'' during and after the recall. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has no power to compel the documents be turned over, said <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, an aide to <PERSON> Hochbrueckner </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION> said it `` will comply with Congressman <PERSON> Hockbreuchner </PERSON>'s request for the data by making available to him all the data which we furnished to <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> on the same schedule.''

 Leftist guerrillas killed 14 people in three raids this week, part of the rebels' biggest offensive yet in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, authorities and news accounts said Wednesday. About 100 rebels attacked <PERSON> Pelaya </PERSON> town, about 250 miles north of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, on Tuesday night, <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Araujo </PERSON> said in a broadcast interview with the Colombian radio chain <ORGANIZATION> RCN </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Araujo </PERSON>, administrative assistant to the <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> state government office, said the attackers stormed a police station, killed two officers and injured five people. The daily <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tiempo </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> reported that leftist guerrillas murdered eight peasants Tuesday in the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiempo </PERSON> quoted peasants there as saying the pro-Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Colombian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> killed the eight for refusing to cooperate with the rebels. The <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> are on <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> coast. <PERSON> Araujo </PERSON> said that last Sunday the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> ELN </ORGANIZATION>, attacked <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jeronimo </LOCATION>, another town in <LOCATION> Cesar </LOCATION> state, and killed four ranchers for refusing to pay what the guerrillas call a revolution tax. The guerrillas also gathered townspeople in the town square and exhorted them not to vote in the March 13 nationwide mayoral elections. In the first two months of 1988 rebels kidnapped 14 mayors, attacked a dozen towns, killed 31 soldiers, 28 police and 80 other people, blew up oil pipelines and electricity cable towers and attacked oil company drilling camps. Two of the mayors _ <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pitalito </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Anibal </PERSON> <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Agustin </LOCATION> _ were freed in army attacks Friday on guerrilla encampments near the southern town of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Agustin </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Agustin </LOCATION> is popular with foreign tourists because of the many pre-Columbian statues in an archaeological park there. The mayors were kidnapped Feb. 25 by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which freed 12 mayors previously after telling them to do more for poor people in their districts. Political violence has been worst in southern <LOCATION> Caqueta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> state </LOCATION>, where 40 local leaders of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> were killed in the last three months. Party leaders said the rebels were trying to terrorize it into withdrawing from mayoral elections so the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> party will win. <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, a congressman from the state, was shot and wounded Tuesday night in <LOCATION> Florencia </LOCATION>, the state capital, national police said in a communique. It said <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON> was out of danger in a hospital. There are five leftist guerrilla groups in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. Three members of the <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> were murdered in <LOCATION> Caqueta </LOCATION> state in the last month. Right-wing death squads were blamed for killing nearly 500 of the party's workers in the last two years.

<TEXT>
 The union representing 6,700 <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight attendants instructed members Wednesday to begin a slowdown by doing everything by the book. The attendants have remained on the job since a deadline for a new contract passed Friday. `` Keep them busy, keep them guessing, keep them confused,'' <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Musto </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> Local 2747, said in a recorded message on the union hotline. `` Remember you have to have all luggage stowed before you can give permission to close the front boarding door. I think you get the idea,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Redmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> said the airline operated normally Wednesday. `` We have seen no evidence of any disruption or attempt at disruption,'' he said. No talks are scheduled. The main stumbling block to a contract is a company proposal to delay the promotion of lower-paid workers to the higher bracket. <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> McMahon </PERSON>, operations manager for the five <ORGANIZATION> AAA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> offices in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, said she had not noticed any effect on business or service from slowdown tactics. `` I have n't heard any specific complaints at this point. I was certainly apprehensive when I heard about the ` guerrilla warfare' this morning Everything seems to be going pretty much as usual,'' Ms. <PERSON> McMahon </PERSON> said. The threat of a strike has not deterred many travelers from flying <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, she said. `` A lot of times there is n't comparable service on another carrier. They will take their chances that <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> will be operating because they want to fly non-stop,'' Ms. <PERSON> McMahon </PERSON> said. Many business travelers are making alternate arrangements in case of a strike, but vacationers who bought discount tickets in advance have little recourse, she said. The unions representing the pilots and <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION>, who are trying to negotiate separate contracts, have not said whether they would honor flight attendants' picket lines.

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> overwhelmingly passed a landmark civil rights bill Wednesday that would broaden protections for women, minorities, the elderly and the handicapped, but President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has vowed to veto the measure. The Civil Rights Restoration Act, considered by many lawmakers the most significant civil rights measure in 20 years, was sent to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on a 315-98 vote. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passed it by an equally lopsided 75-14 vote in January. Both chambers passed the bill by the two-thirds margin needed to override a presidential veto, but it was unclear whether the huge margins would hold up following <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s vow Wednesday to reject the measure. The restoration act was designed to reverse a 1984 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision that narrowed the scope of four major civil rights laws meant to prevent taxpayer financing of discrimination. Supporters of the act said hundreds of discrimination complaints had been dropped or restricted since the decision. `` We have suffered far too long in waiting for this great and important day,'' said Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>, D-Mich. In letters delivered Wednesday to several <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Republicans, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said flatly he will veto the measure `` if it is presented to me in its current form.'' In the letters, sent from <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is attending a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit, the president said the bill `` dramatically expands the scope of federal jurisdiction over state and local governments and the private sector'' and `` poses a particular threat to religious liberty.'' In the case brought by <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> -RRB- College, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> held in a 6-3 opinion that Title IX _ a law barring sex discrimination in federally funded education programs _ applies only to specific programs or activities receiving federal assistance and not the institutions of which they are part. The restoration act clarifies that entire institutions and government agencies are covered if any program or activity within them receives federal aid. The broad coverage also applies to the private sector if the aid goes to a corporation as a whole or if the recipient principally provides education, health care, housing, social services or parks and recreation. The bill also says farmers getting crop subsidies, people on food stamps and other individuals receiving federal assistance are not required to comply with the anti-discrimination statutes. Sponsors of the restoration act said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> always intended broad civil rights protections on the theory that `` those who dip their hands in the public till should not object if a little democracy sticks to their fingers,'' as Rep. <PERSON> Augustus </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, D-Calif., put it But opponents claim the bill goes far beyond restoration. Like <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, they complained that it is too intrusive into the private sector and religious organizations. `` The wording of the law is going to bring about unintended consequences like you could never imagine,'' said Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gekas </PERSON>, R-Pa. House leaders provoked controversy by bringing the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s version of the civil rights bill directly to the floor Wednesday, bypassing <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committees and limiting amendments to one <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> substitute for the entire `` We need a Voting Rights Act for congressmen,'' sputtered Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>. But other members said there had been more than 40 committee hearings on the <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> bill since 1984. <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and a senior member of the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION>, said 2,500 amendments had been offered over the years. `` All the compromises that can possibly be made have already been made. Certainly all the ideas that could ever have been thought of have already been expressed,'' said <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>. `` The time -LRB- to act -RRB- is now.'' The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> substitute, sponsored by Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sensenbrenner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wis </LOCATION>., would have limited the bill's impact on corporations and allowed more educational institutions to escape compliance with the sex discrimination ban on religious grounds <PERSON> Sensenbrenner </PERSON> said he offered it in `` a spirit of reconciliation'' to end the four-year congressional ordeal over the bill. But it was defeated 266-146. An anti-abortion amendment adopted by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> says nothing in the bill or in existing law requires institutions to perform or pay for abortions. The amendment invalidates 1975 regulations that bar discrimination against women who have had abortions or sought them and require college health plans to treat abortions like other temporary disabilities. Feminists considered the amendment a setback but did not actively oppose the civil rights bill in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right-To-Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> called the amendment a great victory, saying Wednesday that `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has emphatically rejected the legal doctrine that anti-abortion policies are a form of sex discrimination.'' The restoration act applies to the four civil rights laws affected by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling: Title IX of the 1972 Education Amendments, barring sex discrimination in federally funded education programs; the 1964 Civil Rights Act, barring racial discrimination in federally-assisted programs; the 1973 Rehabilitation Act, barring discrimination against the handicapped in any program or activity receiving federal aid; and the 1975 Age Discrimination Act, barring employment discrimination against older people. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed the restoration act in similar form on a vote of 375-32 in 1984, shortly after the court decision. The bill was bottled up in a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee until last year.

 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders on Wednesday demanded huge cutbacks in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact tanks and artillery that `` cast a shadow'' over <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and endorsed President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s efforts to negotiate strategic arms reductions with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Defining strategy for a new set of East-West negotiations, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders said Soviet conventional forces pose the threat of a surprise attack and must be slashed to rectify an imbalance in military strength. The Soviet cutbacks would entail, for example, `` the elimination from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> of tens of thousands of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact weapons relevant to surprise attack, among them tanks and artillery pieces,'' a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> communique said. Meeting behind closed doors at alliance's heavily guarded headquarters, the leaders of the 16 alliance countries attempted to accentuate agreement. They did not want to highlight differences about the pace of modernizing short-range nuclear missiles left in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> after the elimination of longer-range weapons covered by a new U.S.-Soviet arms treaty. British sources speaking on condition of anonymity said <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers late Wednesday agreed on compromise language for a final declaration Thursday on the modernization issue. The summit participants will call for the short-range nuclear missiles to `` continue to be kept up-to-date where necessary,'' the sources said, a statement that avoids the word `` modernization,'' to which <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> objects. According to his spokesman, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, telling the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders, `` If we do not all hang together, we will assuredly hang separately.'' Security was so strict that a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> guard attempted to eject a reporter who asked <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> a question as the leaders posed for a `` family photo.'' Emphasizing alliance unity, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` There are no great fundamental differences there. I have never seen such harmony and togetherness as we have.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> mixed <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summitry with <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace efforts. He ordered Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> to make a whirlwind return to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> after the summit windup Thursday night to continue his efforts to set up Arab-Israeli peace talks. First, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> will stop in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to see <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, and on Friday will visit <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, returning to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> early Saturday morning. The <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> meeting is the alliance's first summit since 1982. Accompanied by their foreign ministers, the leaders gathered at a long, walnut-brown oval table in a conference room shortly after noon to hear an opening statement by <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s secretary general For a minute or so, <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON>'s remarks were obscured by a loud hum on the translation earphones, causing foreign officials and their aides to pull the earplugs out briefly and switch channels for a clearer sound. <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s effort to secure a 50 percent cut in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet long-range missiles `` has the alliance's full support.'' He spoke of Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as a man `` who is ready to reduce some tensions'' but expressed concern about the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>'s military might and `` the denial of basic human rights and freedom to the peoples of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' The leaders held nearly three hours of formal talks, in addition to a luncheon and dinner, and issued a communique demanding that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> reduce its advantage in conventional, or non-nuclear forces. The document highlights an issue of broad agreement within the Western alliance _ directing the focus away from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s reluctance to move ahead with an alliance decision to modernize short-range nuclear weapons <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which is most threatened by short-range weapons, is pressing for talks with the Soviets to reduce the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s large edge in those weapons Most of the other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders _ including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> _ oppose such talks now, fearing they could lead to demands for eliminating all of the weapons, leaving <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> exposed to the Soviets' superior conventional forces. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said most of the leaders, in their private remarks, touched on the issue of modernizing the short-range weapons. `` Everybody has some feelings about that issue, some more supportive than others.'' A White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> spoke most directly on the issue, but that even his remarks were muted. On the question of conventional forces, there is no dispute in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> that the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact has an advantage: about 3-to-1 in tanks and artillery and nearly 2-to-1 in combat aircraft and troops, including reserves in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> contends that East-West conventional forces are roughly equivalent. Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s national security adviser, said the conventional arms negotiations `` will perhaps be more difficult than any of the nuclear arms talks that have been held so far because we're talking about large asymmetries, we're talking about a large imbalance between our forces and those of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> repeatedly denied there were any differences in the talks, but <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>, suggested otherwise. He said that with 16 leaders, `` certainly there will be differences and there will be heated debate and discussion from time to time.' However, <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said `` there was a sense of unity that was overwhelming. `` And any minor dispute that might exist, or some of the debates that are going on as to how one should characterize the modernization issue -LRB- with short-range nuclear forces -RRB-, pales in comparison to the overall sense of unity that was conveyed at the meeting today,'' he said. In a six-page statement on conventional forces, the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders said: `` The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s military presence in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, at a level far in excess of its needs for self-defense, directly challenges our security as well as our hopes for change in the political situation in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` Thus, the conventional imbalance in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> remains at the core of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s security concerns.'' The document sets the stage for negotiations to begin in earnest this fall in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, with representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> consisting of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and six East European allies. `` Our aim will be to establish a situation in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in which force postures as well as the numbers of deployments and weapons systems no longer make surprise attack and large-scale offensive action a feasible option,'' the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> statement said. The new set of negotiations would replace 15 years of talks that have failed to produce agreement. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> wants the new talks to encompass the full European area, from the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Ural </LOCATION> mountains, whereas the old talks were limited to the central front.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is taking legal action to prevent <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s military-dominated regime from withdrawing Panamanian government funds from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks, a lawyer representing opposition forces said Wednesday. Meanwhile, Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> raised the possibility that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will withhold the next payment due to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> for tolls, fees and services for <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> operations. The two developments indicated <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration interest in accelerating a campaign of economic denial against the Panamanian regime, dominated by the chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Panamanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, a lawyer for ousted <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, told a news conference about the alleged <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> effort to freeze <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> government funds deposited in American banks. Although no firm figures were available, $ 50 million was said to be involved. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had no comment on the reported action, but other officials, speaking only on condition of anonymity, confirmed that the measures outlined by <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> were being taken. Asked about the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position on that issue, <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, `` We know who the legitimate government of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is. If the government of President <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> says to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> banks, do n't pay money to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, then all those banks are going to come to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and say, ` Who's got the authority here? <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> or <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>?' `` We're going to answer that question. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> is president of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. And <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has been fired and he does not have legitimate authority here.'' <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Arnold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> law firm, said the administration action was being carried out to ensure that the banks may make disbursements only to the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> ambassador who served under <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON>. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> was ousted last week after he tried to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and has been in hiding in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was issuing `` formal certifications'' that it regards <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> as `` the accredited representative of the recognized government of the country.'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> deputy spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said only that such certifications were being prepared. She declined to specify their purpose. At issue is the status of Panamanian government deposits at five American banks. The attempt by <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> and his allies to prevent the transfer of these funds to the new Panamanian government is part of an ambitious plan of economic warfare aimed at toppling <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> was forced out last week after <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, under federal indictment on drug smuggling charges, ignored <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s attempt to replace him. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said the banks believed to have Panamanian government deposits are <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NA </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION>. `` Every dime we can find is in those banks,'' <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said. He added that any bank which ignores the order could be liable for whatever payments it makes to the current Panamanian government. <LOCATION> Marine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Trust </PERSON> refused comment on the purported <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> action. Another <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> banking source, insisting on anonymity, questioned the legitimacy of the effort to block transfers of funds. <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is seriously considering withholding from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> the next payment, due March 15, of the fees the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> gives <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> for use of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. He estimated that figure at $ 8 million, but other sources said it was closer to $ 7 million. Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> confirmed that a request from the <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> government to put the funds in escrow had been received and that the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was consulting with other agencies on how to proceed. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> indicated that no such request had been received but that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would respond positively if asked. `` If they ask us to pay the canal payments into a different account or delay it, I think we'd do that. We'd respond to President <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>. `` If he tells us he does n't want that money going to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, then we're not going to give it to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>.'' Several members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which has jurisdiction over the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>, called on President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to withhold the payment and threatened to legislate that step if he refuses to go along. Rep. <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tauzin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-La </LOCATION>., said, `` They -LRB- the Panamanian authorities -RRB- are in dire need of funds If this payment is denied to them, the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> regime will have great difficulty maintaining itself.'' The legislators said nearly $ 80 million a year is paid to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> under terms of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> treaties. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, lawyers for <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> sued in federal court to block the <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> from turning over millions of dollars to the new Panamanian government. The lawsuit was dropped after the bank agreed to transfer the money, estimated at $ 10 million, to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> for safekeeping. In related matters Wednesday: _ Sen <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> is conducting an internal investigation into allegations that it was the source of personal and political information on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senators forwarded to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The allegations of the CIA-Noriega link were first made at a congressional hearing last month by <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blandon </PERSON>, a former top Panamanian intelligence official. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law prohibits the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> from engaging in domestic spying on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens. Two officials who identified themselves as being with the spy agency's office of the inspector general interviewed <PERSON> Blandon </PERSON> last week, <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> said. _ After meeting at the Capitol with Panamanian opposition political leaders, <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass., said they will offer on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor on Thursday `` a progressive plan of increased economic pressure'' against the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> regime <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION>, said the campaign to restore democracy will prevail by combining `` peaceful people power'' in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, international public opinion and `` the growing economic pressure that is being exercised on the illegitimate regime of Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>.'' _ Financial experts in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> said billions of dollars in bank deposits have been taken out of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> for safer havens in the wake of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s drug indictment in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> last month `` This certainly has destabilized <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> as a banking center,'' said <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdes-Fauli </PERSON>, senior vice president and manager of the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> office of London-based <ORGANIZATION> Barclay </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. One unidentified top banking expert told The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> that from June to October, Panamanian banks lost $ 7 billion of the $ 36 billion they held. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in the 1980s had come to be known as the <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, offering banking secrecy and stability to the region's investors and depositors. Unlike other countries, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> can not cover its cash shortages by printing new money becuase the dollar is the national currency.

 <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops fired tear gas inside an Arab hospital Wednesday, forcing doctors to don gas masks and sending dozens of choking patients fleeing with their faces covered by <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> headdresses. Soldiers clubbed a Palestinian teen-ager suspected of throwing rocks at troops from a barricade erected about 10 yards from the hospital's emergency room. An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> photographer saw soldiers throw the youth head first down a flight of stairs, then sit on his stomach while beating him with a wooden truncheon. Troops detained 20 Arabs suspected of participating in demonstrations in <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, meanwhile, ordered Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> to return to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> on Thursday for further talks with <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, police detained 27 Israeli students from the <PERSON> Bezalel </PERSON> art school after their parade for the Jewish holiday of Purim turned into a protest against the Israeli handling of unrest in the territories. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> defended <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s policy of using blows to subdue <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> protesters, saying that of several thousand soldiers serving in the occupied territories, only 2 percent to 3 percent had commited excesses, the <ORGANIZATION> Itim </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. As a matter of policy, the army does not release exact figures on troop deployment. In <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>, eight miles north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, soldiers fired at least six tear gas canisters at <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> protesters who used rocks and twisted metal to block a street outside government-run <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> and hurled stones at a dozen soldiers. One smoking canister landed in the emergency room reception area and a second in a hospital courtyard. Two doctors donned gas masks and others held onions to their noses to counter the effects of the gas. About 30 coughing patients, including old men with canes, used Arab headdresses to cover their faces. `` Even the doctors could n't breathe, so imagine the effects on the patients inside, many of whom are seriously ill,'' said one doctor, who declined to identify himself. Soldiers detained three youths outside the hospital, dragging away one of them with a gash on his forehead and a blood-drenched shoulder. The tear gas attack was the second on the hospital in two days. On Tuesday, three soldiers burst into the hospital, fired tear gas and struck two doctors with their rifles as they searched for demonstrators, the hospital director said. An army spokesman denied soldiers entered the hospital or beat doctors in Tuesday's incident. Palestinian protesters have used hospitals, schools and sacred mosques as hideouts to elude arrest and as staging grounds for anti-Israeli riots, according to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials and eyewitnesses. Also in <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> Wednesday, police briefly detained three Italian legislators who chained themselves to electric poles outside a refugee camp and distributed anti-occupation leaflets, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, Palestinian organizers permitted merchants to open their stores for three hours a day following a three-month commercial strike, an Arab reporter said. But the army forced the stores to remain closed, saying storekeepers were being intimidated, and the army would only permit them to resume business when they did it of their own free will. In the past, soldiers repeatedly tried to force stores to open to break the strike. On the diplomatic front, right-wing legislators said <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> had gone back on previous understandings with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> by insisting the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> be involved in peace talks `` King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> says the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> must be involved in the peace process and he wants a full-scale international conference,'' <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> legislator <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Meridor </PERSON>, a close aide to Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, told <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television. `` If that's progress, I do n't know what going backward is.'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> agreed the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> should not be included in talks. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> himself on Wednesday accused <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> of siding with `` the most extreme elements in the Arab world'' and said the ultimate goal of all <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders was to destroy <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. He spoke to members of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. The Haaretz daily reported that, in order to prevent excesses by soldiers, the army decided troops should not serve in the occupied territories for more than 1 -LCB- months at a time. The newspaper said the army believed frustration and anger built up during more than two months of serving in the territories had caused four soldiers photographed by <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> to beat two bound Arabs with stones last week. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said he was considering further restrictions on media access in the occupied territories, saying journalists have harmed <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. He did not say what steps he might take. Soldiers now are authorized to temporarily close parts of the occupied territories to reporters. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> also called on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> Jewish leaders to quell any criticism of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> within their ranks, saying it was `` non-Jewish to join an anti-Israeli front of non-Jewish people.''

 Republican presidential hopeful <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> implied Wednesday there was a connection between Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s tenure as head of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and speculation that Panamanian strong man <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was on the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> payroll. That drew a sharp response from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> appeared with a dancing pineapple before a crowd of about 300 at a windy, rain-threatened rally in downtown <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. At least twice <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> implied that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who was head of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> from 1976-77, might have had some dealings with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` There's some evidence -LRB- <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> -RRB- was on the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> payroll as far back as 1966. That's all I know,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. He would not discuss what the evidence was or what he knew. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, campaigning in <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, criticized <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> for bringing up the subject. `` I find it amazing that a <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> senator will talk about <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> matters. I took an oath of office to protect sources and methods of intelligence and I would never discuss anything I was doing at the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> that would affect the national security,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` There has been one charge after another in this campaign and I have just decided not to respond to Mr. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s charges.'' However, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> pointed to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s recent indictment on federal drug charges. `` I would point out that it's the Reagan-Bush administration under which Mr. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is being indicted in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> for drugs.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> has grown increasingly critical of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the final days before the Super Tuesday round of caucuses and primaries in which the vice president has a comfortable lead. `` I need to convince a lot of people in the next few days there's only one candidate tough enough to do the job, and that candidate's <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said if elected he would force his desire for a line-item veto into the courts. `` When the appropriations bill comes down, I'd line-item veto a few things ... and send it back to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Then we'd have a constitutional question,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said, which would throw the issue into the courts. If <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> wo n't approve a balanced budget amendment, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said he would go to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people and call a constitutional convention to get one. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> also pledged to support American interests in the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> Canal Zone after the year 2000, when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is supposed to turn over control of the canal to the central American country. `` I sure am glad I voted against the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> treaty. That vote looks better every day,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 Two big obstacles in the war on drugs are low-level bureaucrats who do n't have their hearts in the effort and an overbearing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, two top administration officials contended Wednesday Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, one of four Cabinet officials appearing on a nine-member administration panel at the White House Conference on a <LOCATION> Drug-Free </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, asserted there is no problem of leadership at the top. He called for more state and local financial assistance, less congressional meddling and more determination by federal employees to get with the programs outlined by their superiors. Responding to written questions submitted by some of the estimated 2,000 people attending the conference, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said there is no need for a federal drug czar to coordinate the battle. `` I thik this idea has been so discredited there is nobody that really believes in that any more,'' he said. `` What has happened is there is a drug czar in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and that is the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> acknowledged that with several different agencies involved `` you're going to have differences of opinion,'' but he said there are mechanisms for resolving interagency disputes and that he is `` not worried about the organizational aspects.'' However, he continued: `` I am extremely concerned about the fragmentation that goes on in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the fact that we have 32 different committees in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> with cognizance over the drug problem so that too many of the leaders who are seated on the stage here are spending their time testifying in front of congressional committees instead of leading the forces that ought to be out in the field working on the drug problem.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON>, commissioner of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said too many bureaucrats lack enthusiasm for fighting the drug war. `` I have been flat out told by many bureaucrats that just because the president is supporting an effort it does n't mean that money goes with it,'' he said. `` We do n't need a bunch of bureaucrats that will deal with this war on drugs the way they dealt with the war in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. We need heart in this effort ...'' `` There are still too many people who work for us _ in my organization as well _ who still have their noses too deeply buried in their old books,'' the Customs chief said. `` These are the conscientious objectors, the shirkers and the fourth columnists in this war.'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> associated himself with those remarks, but neither he nor von <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> identified the people they were talking about. Responding to another question, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> discounted any implication that he does not favor continued federal financing for federal drug treatment programs. But he said state and local officials need to do more. <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said that starting March 15, the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> will begin taking the passports of Americans who try to re-enter the country with drugs. The passports are to be seized as evidence of a crime and forwarded to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kittredge </PERSON>. Among the other administration participants at the congressionally ordered conference was Education Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, who embraced the long-simmering idea of making more use of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military forces to interdict the flow of drugs into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` As the greatest military and economic power in the world, we can do more to prevent criminals in foreign nations from growing or processing illegal drugs,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. `` It is to be hoped we can do this in collaboration with foreign governments, but if need be we must consider doing this by ourselves,'' he said. `` And we should consider broader use of military force against both the production and shipment of drugs.'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has considered legislation since 1983 to authorize military intervention against drug shipments. The measure has passed the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in one form or another on three occasions, but has never passed the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The latest congressional action on the issue called for the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> to study the impact on military readiness of having the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> play a lead role in the anti-drug effort. During Wednesday's session, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> was rebuffed when he attempted to ask a question about the role of the military in the drug war from the floor rather than submit it in writing as others were required to do. `` What I saw was a lot of back-scratching,'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said later of the preceedings. `` It is incredible ... that they would stifle debate and not allow questions from the floor. It is a disservice to the mission.'' But <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, who said he was speaking for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayors </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters he liked what he heard from <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> and <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> _ especially the idea of using military forces against foreign drug dealers. `` We'll take care of the communists later,'' he said. `` They're not now seeking to invade the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> It's the drug dealers.''

 <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> fulfilled a boyhood ambition Wednesday as he detoured from the beaten political campaign trail to make a pilgrimage to the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION> spring training camp. He did n't forget politics, also making a speech at a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> high school, celebrating his victory in Tuesday's non-binding <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> primary and crowing in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> that `` we must be coming on strong folks'' when told that <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had criticized him in another Southern state. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> wanted to reduce the number of <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> battleships, which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called a `` dumb idea.'' `` We'll have a strong, well-equipped <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, but we're not going to spend $ 36 billion on two super carrier task forces,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor began airing a new television commercial attacking Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and mocking <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s populist slogan, `` It's your fight too. The advertisement says <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> is taking campaign contributions from `` big establishment power brokers'' and adds: `` Kinda makes you wonder, is <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> fighting your fight or theirs?'' In Winter Haven, unlike ordinary tourists, the governor even got a turn in the big league batting cage, although he had little to show for it. The one-time freshman catcher on the <LOCATION> Brookline </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> squad donned <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION> jersey No. 1 and took 10 swings against a batting practice pitcher. He fouled off three balls, popped one into the batting cage, hit five grounders and whiffed once. `` I want you to work on your swing,'' advised outfielder <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>. `` At least I made contact,'' said the 54-year-old governor. He acknowledged to reporters, `` I'm a little rusty, as you can see.'' The self-described `` long-suffering'' <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION> fan said, `` It's a great thrill to be here. I've never been to spring training. It's something all <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> kids want to do. `` I'm very optimistic about the campaign and the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. `` If we could both win our World Series, that would be a -LRB- great -RRB- 1988.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is doing well in many polls heading into Tuesday's round of 20 primaries and caucuses, primarily in the South, but he said the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION>, like himself, should `` just keep working and do n't pay any attention to the polls.'' Outside a high school in <LOCATION> Apopka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, `` We're going to do well across the South'' with a campaign emphasizing `` jobs, good health care, the environment _ things that people care about in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and all over the country. Referring to rival <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator who has geared his campaign to the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, `` If you put all of your eggs in one regional basket ... it becomes a lot more crucial that you do exceedingly well.'' He got an enthusiastic welcome at an assembly of <ORGANIZATION> Apopka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>'s 460-member senior class, but there were a few groans when <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> defended his stands against aid to the Contras and the Strategic Defense Initiative. When <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> asked, `` Is it going to be Star Wars or housing for the homeless, is it going to be MX missiles or housing for the homeless?'' some of the teen-agers replied, `` Star Wars, MX missiles.'' Nearly one-fifth of <LOCATION> Apopka </LOCATION>'s students are in a Marine ROTC program and several seniors wore their dress blues. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also got a campaign boost in the Super Tuesday state of <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, where Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Waihee </PERSON> has thrown the support of the state's <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leadership behind him. <PERSON> Waihee </PERSON> had maintained an uncommitted stance until now. `` I think the game is on the line Tuesday. We can stand on the sidelines and watch, or we can get into the game,'' <PERSON> Waihee </PERSON> told a news conference Wednesday in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. The announcement came with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> listening in from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, on a telephone conference call. `` I'm sitting here glowing,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. He called <PERSON> Waihee </PERSON> `` a man who has shown great wisdom in his choice of presidential candidates.'' <PERSON> Waihee </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> endorsement has the backing of <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>'s Sens <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON> and <PERSON> Spark </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsunaga </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Akaka </PERSON>, Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Cayetano </PERSON> and other Democratic leaders. <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>'s Super Tuesday precinct elections will include a presidential preference vote that will be binding on at least 20 of <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>'s 28 delegates to the Democratic Party National Convention. Before the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> endorsement, party leaders said they had expected <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to gain a plurality in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>'s precinct elections, with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and `` uncommitted'' splitting most of the balance.

<TEXT>
 A senator complained Wednesday that Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> sent an `` inappropriate'' letter proclaiming his innocence to every member of the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which is sitting as judge and jury at his impeachment trial. An irate Sen. <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> `` Chuy'' <PERSON> Higuera </PERSON> arose at the close of the third day of the first-term <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION>'s impeachment trial and held up the letter. `` I hope Governor <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> understands the oath we have taken,'' said <PERSON> Higuera </PERSON>, urging other senators not to read the document. `` I hope Mr. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> would understand it's inappropriate to try to communicate with us.'' The five-page document was a copy of <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s statement from a Saturday news conference during which the governor pleaded his case and claimed it was unfair to try him on impeachment charges before a criminal case can be resolved. A cover memo on the governor's official stationery accompanied each copy. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, 63, was impeached by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on charges of concealing a $ 350,000 campaign loan, borrowing $ 80,000 in state funds for his auto dealership and trying to thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat against a former aide. He also also faces a March 22 trial March on charges of concealing the loan and a May 17 recall election. One of <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s lawyers, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> he considered the governor's sending the letter appropriate. `` It's a political proceeding,'' said <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>. `` The senators have received communications from many people pro and con. I do n't see why the governor should be any different.'' Some senators who had voted to delay the impeachment trial said they had received notes from <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> thanking them for their support. In recent weeks, senators have asked that <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> stop making phone calls to their offices during the impeachment proceedings. They said they consider the calls inappropriate and did not talk the governor, who is suspended from office. On Tuesday, a flap arose when it appeared that <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> had tried to contact a witness, but the governor later said the phone call was placed by mistake. During testimony earlier in the day, an attorney for <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> suggested that the alleged death threat to a grand jury witness was `` a political matter,'' not a crime. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s former security chief, testifying for a second day, said he considered the incident a potential felony and told <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> a crime could be involved. `` The criminal nature of it was primary in my mind,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> `` Beau'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. `` I did not really think of it in the political sense.'' `` Did n't you also believe this could be a political matter?'' defense attorney <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Craft </PERSON> asked. `` I do n't recall that that crossed my mind,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and another former member of the governor's security detail have testified they were told that <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s aide, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, threatened in November that the governor's former legislative liaison, <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, might `` go on a long boat ride'' if she did n't stop testifying before a grand jury investigating <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> is accused of instructing the head of the <ORGANIZATION> DPS </ORGANIZATION> not to cooperate in the attorney general's probe. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> has denied threatening Ms. <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, and he has not been charged. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, who stayed away from the trial for a third day, has said he did n't know all the details of the incident, contended that he did n't know a potential felony was involved and blamed his security officers for not fully informing him. `` I told him it was a felony to tamper with a witness,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. `` I did n't say the words ` death threat.' But I said ` tampering with a witness.' I have no doubts about that ... I was not hiding anything from the governor.'' He also said he thought the matter was `` being taken too lightly'' by the governor and his staff. `` When you took it to <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Craft </PERSON> did he take it seriously?'' Craft asked, referring to himself. Craft was formerly <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s lobbyist in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> `` Yes,'' said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. `` But I think the focus of your concern was embarrassment to the governor.'' Craft's participation as defense attorney as well as a principal in the disputed events raised protests from some senators. Republican Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Usdane </PERSON> accused Craft of misleading senators about his role when they agreed to let him join the defense. His participation as a lawyer bars him from being called by either side as a witness, although some senators believe they could call Craft to testify. Earlier, the trial's presiding officer, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> Chief Justice <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> X. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, said he would not allow the defense to introduce an affidavit intended to discredit a key witness by alleging he had an affair with an employee in 1982. The prospective witness, <ORGANIZATION> DPS </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Milstead </PERSON>, has said the allegations are `` ridiculous.'' `` I do n't think it's necessary to go into old past history about someone's past sexual liaison, and he denies it,'' said <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>. `` It has no value to prove anything material to these issues.'' A two-thirds vote of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would be required to convict <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> on any count and remove him from office. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> could, by another two-thirds vote, then bar <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> from holding any state office again.

 An opposition leader said Wednesday that Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was purging his army of suspected opponents, and doctors joined businesses in a general strike aimed at ousting the military strongman. <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochez </PERSON>, a national legislator and vice president of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> apparently had fired two senior colonels and two majors suspected of being disloyal. <PERSON> Cochez </PERSON> said they included Col. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> <PERSON> Justines </PERSON>, who as chief of staff was No. 2 in the Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and next in line to succeed <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. For a second day, the strike was marked by violence in a middle-class neighborhood near the banking district. On Tuesday, security agents destroyed an opposition radio station in the neighborhood, apparently because it broadcast an appeal for anti-Noriega demonstrations. Demonstrators gathered Wednesday along the four-lane street in front of the station, set up barricades of burning trash, and set fire to a minivan and a car. Anti-riot police chased the protesters into side streets and apartment buildings. Chunks of concrete were hurled down at police from at least two of the apartment houses. Police fired tear-gas grenades and pumped tear gas into the buildings from portable tanks, filling the entire neighborhood with the acrid, stinging fumes. The officer in charge stood in the middle of the street and shouted to residents, `` You'll come out like cockroaches!'' None did, and reporters on the scene saw no one injured. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said anonymous telephone callers warned Tuesday and Wednesday that a bomb was planted in commission headquarters. Spokesman <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Castrellon </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the building was evacuated and searched both days but no bombs were found. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, meanwhile, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, a lawyer for a Panamanian opposition group, said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was taking legal action to keep <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s regime from withdrawing <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> government funds from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks. About $ 50 million was said to be involved. Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> raised the possibility that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will withhold the next payment due to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> for tolls, fees and services for <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> operations. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> also told the <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> that `` if the government of President -LRB- <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> says to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> banks, do n't pay money to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, then all those banks are going to come to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and say, ` Who's got the authority here <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> or <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>?' `` We're going to answer that question ... <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has been fired and he does not have legitimate authority there,'' <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Cochez </PERSON> said he could not `` absolutely confirm'' the firings, but several diplomatic sources said they also had heard the reports and tended to believe them. <PERSON> Justines </PERSON> was chosen by President <PERSON> Devalle </PERSON> on Feb. 25 to replace <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, but <PERSON> Devalle </PERSON>'s attempt to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> backfired. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> supporters in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> instead voted to oust <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Justines </PERSON> then joined other ranking officers in pledging their loyalty to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who is under indictment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug trafficking charges. <PERSON> Cochez </PERSON> said Col. <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON>, the army chief and the No. 4 man in the military hierarchy, also was fired, along with two majors, <PERSON> Moises </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Rio </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Quesada </PERSON>. `` I think the purge is good for the democratic process because it will show the other officers that he -LRB- <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> -RRB- is not interested in the institution, but only in himself,'' <PERSON> Cochez </PERSON> said. `` Most officers are supporting <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> because they consider it an institutional problem.'' The armed forces press office said it could not confirm the reported removals of officers. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has headed the 15,000-member Defense Forces, which includes the army, navy, air force and police, since 1983. He was seen as the real power behind <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s civilian government. Most of the capital's doctors appeared to have joined the nationwide strike against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, which began Monday. AP reporters visited four hospitals and clinics around the capital Wednesday and found them taking new patients only on an emergency basis. The government, which through official media has been calling the strike `` a complete failure,'' tacitly admitted health care problems. The <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> issued a communique calling on all unemployed physicians to report to ministry offices for assignment. Calls to areas outside the capital indicated mixed participation in the strike. In Colon, the country's other major commercial center, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Delgado </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> said economic activity had proceeded almost normally Monday and Tuesday. But he said the chamber called on members to join the strike for 48 hours beginning Thursday. In <LOCATION> Chiriquii </LOCATION> province, on the Costa Rican border, the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> reported a significant reduction in activity, with virtually all branches of capital-based stores and businesses shut down. In Chitre, 90 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Horacio </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executives </ORGANIZATION>, said about 60 percent of the city's economic activity was shut down. The National Civic Crusade, an alliance of about 200 business, labor, professional and political groups, claimed Tuesday night that the strike had succeeded in shutting down 85 percent of the country's economic acivity.

 President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> on Wednesday proposed holding the third round of Nicaraguan cease-fire talks without the country's <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> leader, saying the mediator had failed to produce results. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said the talks, scheduled for next week, should be held in the Nicaraguan town of <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, near the Costa Rican border. It was the first time the leftist Sandinista government has agreed to talk to the U.S.-backed rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Cardinal <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON> has been mediating the talks on ending the 7-year-old war. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said his government decided `` to take the bull by the horns'' because <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON>'s mediation had not produced any results. `` The cardinal himself had suggested some time ago that a direct meeting, and in our country, would be very important,'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said. `` I told him that today I have decided to name the member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Directorate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and defense minister, Gen. <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, as the chief of the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- delegation,'' he added. The defense minister is the president's brother The Contra rebels sent a message to the cardinal earlier Wednesday, agreeing to his proposal to hold new talks on March 10-11. The last round of negotiations broke off Feb. 19 in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> after the cardinal said the two sides had reached an impasse. After making his proposal, President <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said: `` In this manner, we are testing whether there really exists the will to work for peace on the part of the so-called directorate of the counter-revolution, since it can no longer give any excuses.'' He referred to the directorate of the Contra umbrella organization known as the Nicaraguan Resistance. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> spoke with reporters shortly after meeting with <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y Bravo in the evening, but there was no immediate comment from the cardinal. The Sandinistas previously refused to hold the talks in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, saying the rebels should seek a government amnesty before being able to enter the country. <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON> sent a letter to <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> earlier Wednesday hammering at the need to resume cease-fire negotiations. During the February talks, the cardinal increased his role by proposing a peace agenda. Besides calling for a laying down of arms, he asked the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> to grant total political amnesty, restore full press freedoms, revise the military draft law and reopen talks with the opposition political parties that remain active inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. He also suggested the Contras be permitted to enter designated cease-fire zones with their arms for a one-month truce. In their message Wednesday accepting the new round of talks, the Contras reiterated their acceptance of the agenda proposed by the cardinal, said <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosales </PERSON>, a spokesman in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> for the rebel coalition, known as the Nicaraguan Resistance. The Sandinistas maintain they will not discuss political issues with the Contras. They say amnesty will be granted after a cease-fire agreement is reached. Talks with the internal political parties broke off in December when opposition members insisted on constitutional changes. The cease-fire and internal dialogue are outlined in a regional peace plan signed last August by the presidents of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> want talks with the Contras to center on the mechanics of how and where the rebels should lay down their arms. The government asked <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y Bravo last November to mediate the talks. The church backed the successful Sandinista struggle to overthrow the right-wing, pro-American Somoza dynasty in 1979, but later became a firm critic of the Sandinista government. The cardinal acted as go-between until January, when the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> softened their position and agreed to hold direct talks with the rebels. In other developments, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that its intelligence sources reported increased <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military activity in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and American troop movement along its borders. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, said no American troops were near the border with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The spokesman added, however, that engineering-training projects _ carried out annually in the dry season _ had temporarily increased the number of flights out of <LOCATION> Palmerola </LOCATION> air base and the number of troops in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. He spoke on condition of anonymity. The ministry communique said ammunition and explosives were transferred recently from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military installations in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s neighbor to the south. The communique said 1,000 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops, including some from the 82nd Airborne Division, were moved to the <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s northeastern border with <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> It said Special Forces units were moved to the northwestern border. `` There've been no border troop movements,'' the embassy spokesman said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops that participate in combined Honduran-U.S. exercises are prohibited by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law from going within 20 miles of the border with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.

 Winners at the 30th Annual Grammy Awards waxed poetic, gushed, cried, giggled and gave thanks to the music industry, their record companies, friends, family and God as they accepted their prizes Wednesday night. `` I ca n't tell you how I feel,'' said a bubbly <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> <PERSON> Houston </PERSON> backstage at <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> after winning best female pop vocalist for her single, `` I Wan na Dance With Somebody'' from her second LP, `` Whitney.'' `` It's just so emotional. ... I'm nervous, very proud, very honored, excited; it's very great,'' said <PERSON> Houston </PERSON>, who was a Grammy winner two years ago for her platinum debut album. <PERSON> Jody </PERSON> <PERSON> Watley </PERSON>, who was named best new artist, thanked `` everybody at <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION>, my manager, I thank God, my producers ... my video director ... my publicist ... my attorney.'' Veteran rhythm and blues performer <PERSON> Little </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>, who helped define rock' n' roll more than three decades ago, stole the show by declaring himself the winner before opening the envelop to reveal <PERSON> Watley </PERSON>'s name. `` Y' all never gave me no Grammys and I've been singing for years,'' he shouted, strutting about the stage for an amused audience `` I'm the architect of rock' n' roll. ... Being a brown Jew from <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, I had to tell the truth.'' Little <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>, who dropped out of the rock life years ago to become an evangelist, announced two years ago that he had converted to <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bono </PERSON>, lead singer of the Irish rockers U2, whose politically introspective LP, `` The <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> <PERSON> Tree </PERSON>,'' won two Grammys including album of the year, said: `` We set out to make music _ soul music. ... That's not about being black or white. ... It's a decision to reveal or conceal.'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, on tour in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> to promote his hit LP `` Faith,'' was thrilled that he had won a Grammy in the rhythm and blues category for his duo with soul queen <PERSON> Aretha </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>. `` Winning the R & amp; B category with Aretha validates the tremendous influence R & amp; B music has had on my music, songwriting and creative process,'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> said through his spokesman, <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Lobel </PERSON>. `` Not bad for a Brit with soul.'' One of the best acceptances at the awards show came from pianist <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON> who walked off the stage with a twinkle and no comment after being handed the prize for best classical album for his `` <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>.'' Earlier, the esteemed artist thanked the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recording </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Sciences for President's Special Merit Award: `` I am so very happy that classical music still has an appreciation.'' <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>, leader of `` Asleep at the Wheel,'' a five-man band that plays Western swing, said: `` It feels great. It feels amazing. It's like you've been down 10 to nothing in the 9th inning and winning.'' The band won for best country instrumental performance for the song `` String of Pars,'' which <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> said was for golfers. The band last won 10 years ago in the same category for `` 1 O'clock Jump,'' a Count Basie song in Western style. He said it's sometimes difficult keeping a band together. `` Everyday, if you're asleep at the wheel, you're in danger of a lot of things.'' <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Vega </PERSON>, who was nominated for three Grammys for her touching song about an abused child, `` Luka,'' talked backstage at Radio City Music Hall after learning she had lost the trophy for best female pop vocalist and song of the year. She also was nominated for record of the year, but did n't win. `` I was hoping it would win, but I was prepared for anything to happen,'' she said. `` I'm a little disappointed I guess.'' <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Weil </PERSON>, who with <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> won song of the year for writing the sweet ballad, `` Somewhere Out There,'' said: `` We wrote it for the mice. We did n't even think about a pop record when we wrote it.'' The song was written for the animated movie, `` An American Tail,'' the story of an immigrant mouse family. It was recorded as a duet by <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Ronstadt </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON>, who were nominated as best pop performance by a duo or group. When asked if winning the Grammy made up for losing an Academy Award last year for best song, <PERSON> Weil </PERSON> said, `` It does. It's nice to win an award that comes from the music industry _ that's our home.'' <PERSON> Weil </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> are the last songwriting team creating from the legendary Brill Building in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, once a haven for American song. <PERSON> Said </PERSON> <PERSON> Narada </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Walden </PERSON>, who won the producer award for the LP, `` Whitney'': `` I think the world wants new faces in a way. ... <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> is an angel and it's purity, like this flower.'' He was carrying a red rose. `` I felt this was a very special year. My competition is my friends. <PERSON> Quincy </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who co-produced the <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> LP, `` Bad'' -RRB- I love. U2 I admire very much. I think we are all great music lovers. I think we bring the spirit down. We are all brothers.''

 New home sales fell 9 percent in January, pushing sales activity to its slowest pace since the end of the last recession, the government said Wednesday as the housing industry continued to stagger following the October stock market collapse.

In January, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said that sales of new single-family homes fell for the third consecutive month, dropping to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 535,000 units, 26 percent below a year ago and the slowest pace since the last recession was ending in December 1982.

 Once again good news has intruded on the gilded dreams of gold investors, whose hopes for wealth depend on fears of inflation or economic collapse. The price of gold has fallen from $ 500 an ounce in mid-December to $ 430 an ounce this week, making it a particularly bad investment so far in 1988. What went wrong is that too many things went right in the aftermath of October's stock market collapse. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Precious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, ticks some of them off: `` Low inflation, a stronger dollar, stable world equity markets, a stronger <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bond market, rising confidence in the economic outlooks around the world, and, very significantly in the last couple of weeks, rising confidence in the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> and Chairman -LRB- Alan -RRB- <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>.'' Good news for the general public, but bad news for gold bugs. So with good times breaking out, why is <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> still predicting that gold will reach $ 500 an ounce again within the next 12 months, and go `` perhaps significantly higher''? An excess of supply that marked the first few months of 1988 is likely to end, <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> argues. He says the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> probably will sell less gold from now on because it has raised a large portion of the foreign currency reserves it will need for the year. Mining companies will ease up on the downward pressure they put on gold prices through their sales of gold for future delivery in forward contracts, <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> says. And the spate of `` gold loans'' is likely to ease up somewhat, <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Newmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> dumped 1 million ounces of gold onto the market this year when it borrowed against future production and then sold the gold to raise cash and pay off debts acquired in a successful takeover defense. Although an additional 2 million ounces' worth of gold loans are already in the pipeline, <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> said, the flood should diminish after that. On the demand side, investors in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and elsewhere in the Far East have taken a new interest in gold. The Japanese imported 40 tons of gold in February alone, <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> estimates. The appetite for kilobars _ 31 ounces of pure gold _ is so great in the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> that he says fabricators can not keep up. Indians imported 100 tons of gold last year even though it is illegal to bring gold into <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> because of foreign-exchange controls, <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> said, declining to divulge where he got the information. New gold coins from the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagle </ORGANIZATION> and Canadian Maple Leaf to the Chinese Panda are increasing investors' and collectors' interest in gold, while various banks and investment houses have created accumulation plans that allow people to buy gold on schedule And there is always the chance of more bad news _ which, of course, is good news. Trouble in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> tends to push up gold prices by threatening to cut off supplies at the source. And any hint that the next president will be fiscally irresponsible would do wonders for gold. `` Even Republicans can be fiscally stimulative, as we've seen from <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. But generally Democrats have a reputation for not being fiscally conservative,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Norris </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> vice president in charge of precious metals. `` If somebody like <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> ever had a chance of being elected, I think you'd see gold really start to move up,'' <PERSON> Norris </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Romanticized Form of Larceny is On the Rise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MITCHELL LANDSBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In the 1964 film, `` Topkapi,'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Ustinov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Melina </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercouri </PERSON> played thieves who descended into a museum in <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION> through a skylight to steal a jewel-encrusted dagger. That plot was repeated with stunning accuracy last month when burglars broke into <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Colnaghi </ORGANIZATION> Art Gallery through a skylight, shinnied down a rope and plucked 27 Old Master paintings and drawings off the walls. The stolen artwork was valued at $ 6 million, making it the biggest art heist in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> history. The most valuable pieces stolen were two panels by the 15th century Italian Renaissance master Fra Angelico worth $ 4 million. But unlike the cunning thieves in `` Topkapi,'' those who broke into the <LOCATION> Colnaghi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gallery </LOCATION> on Feb. 8 appear to have been unschooled burglars who had no clear idea of what they were stealing. If so, their fate is ironic: their booty may be impossible to sell at anything resembling its face value. Art theft, long romanticized as a genteel form of larceny, is on the rise. Some law enforcement officials and other experts believe it may rank second only to narcotics trafficking in value of ill-gotten gains. `` If you're talking about dollar value, it probably is,'' said one <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official who specializes in crime statistics. He stressed that he was only speculating since art theft is not recognized as a separate category in federal statistics. He declined to give his name. `` It began to increase in the late'50s and the early'60s when the art market began to rise,'' said <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Esterow </PERSON>, editor and publisher of ArtNews magazine. `` More and more thieves began to wake up and say, ` Hey! There's a lot of money here!''' If there was a lot of money then, there's more now. Masterworks often cost many times the value of the mansions where they're hung. <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>'s painting, `` Irises,'' set a record last November when it was sold for $ 53.9 million. Art thieves usually fall into one of three categories, experts say. One is the professional thief who is commissioned to steal specific works of art. `` Mr. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> might have fallen in love with one of these paintings and he wants it so bad he can just taste it, so he goes out and hires someone to steal it,'' explained retired insurance claims investigator <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Mellors </PERSON>, who specialized in fine art claims. In these cases, <PERSON> Mellors </PERSON> and others said, the stolen item may wind up in a private collection for years _ or even generations _ and no money changes hands except the fee paid by the collector to the thief. Less common is the collector who steals art himself, such as the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> doctor who was arrested in 1982 for `` shoplifting'' hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of art from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> galleries for his lavish personal collection. And then, probably most common of all, is the professional thief who steals art and tries to fence it. Sometimes the thief is knowledgeable about art; often he is not, as appears to be the case in the <ORGANIZATION> Colnaghi </ORGANIZATION> break-in, law enforcement officials say. `` It's no secret that thieves who are knowledgeable about art do n't steal well-known pieces,'' said <PERSON> Esterow </PERSON>, who is the author of the book, `` The Art Stealers.'' Detective <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Moscardini </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s full-time art crimes investigator, agreed that the <ORGANIZATION> Colnaghi </ORGANIZATION> thieves may have blundered when they chose works by <ORGANIZATION> Fra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angelico </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Baptiste </PERSON> <PERSON> Simeon </PERSON> <PERSON> Chardin </PERSON> and other Old Masters `` I think it would be difficult to dispose of them because they were somewhat noted pieces,'' he said. `` You're dealing with 15th-16th century works of art -LRB- and -RRB- that in itself would bring some attention.'' According to the experts, smart thieves steal mid-range art, preferably works that are similar to others by the same artist. These works can be sold to unscrupulous or unwitting dealers who do n't conduct thorough background checks. Sometimes they are used in place of currency in drug transactions. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> maintains a list of art reported stolen. The list now contains 278,000 items and is regularly sent to law enforcement agencies, museums and galleries. Between 150 and 300 items are added every month. In the case of a major theft like that from the <ORGANIZATION> Colnaghi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gallery </ORGANIZATION>, the foundation puts out a worldwide alert, complete with photographs of the missing pieces. The glare of publicity makes it hard for a thief, particularly one without connections in the art world, to sell the stolen goods except at an extreme discount to a crooked dealer _ or to an insurance company. `` What are you going to do with a Fra Angelico?'' asked Esterow. `` How are you going to get rid of it, except by making a deal with the insurance company?'' <PERSON> Esterow </PERSON>'s remark brings up one of the touchiest subjects for those who deal with art theft. Insurance adjusters routinely deny that they ever pay ransom to get back a work of art. `` No, no, no, they do n't pay ransom,'' said independent claims adjuster <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who specializes in the fine arts. `` They pay rewards, which are a different thing. They will pay to retrieve property under acceptable circumstances. ... If, for example, an innocent -LRB- party -RRB- comes forward and gives them information that leads to recovery.'' But others say that policy is not strictly followed. `` In <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, -LRB- artworks -RRB- have been held for ransom for the insurance company to pay,'' said <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> art dealer <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Herstand </PERSON>. `` That's arranged frequently. It's even arranged in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. That's fairly common.'' In the <LOCATION> Colnaghi </LOCATION> case, the gallery has announced that its insurance company was offering a reward _ 10 percent of the value of the stolen pieces _ for their return. `` Final determination of eligibility for payment of the reward will be made by the donor, not by the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> or any other party,'' the announcement said. A spokesman for the gallery, vice president <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wintermute </PERSON>, said he could n't say if the thieves were among those eligible for the reward, which could amount to $ 600,000. It was up to the insurance company, he said. The recovery rate for stolen art is probably no greater than 10 percent, experts say. Enforcement is spotty. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> each have one full-time police officer investigating art crimes; the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has one and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has one. They represent the nation's war on art crime. `` It is a big business,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Koczka </PERSON>, a retired <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs agent who was that agency's specialist in fine art crimes. `` It has a minimal risk of being caught or, if you are caught, of going to jail. And unfortunately, if you are a victim, you're very unlikely to recover your property.''

 <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> has been a life-long Mormon, active in church affairs. He is the grandson of church president and prophet <PERSON> Ezra </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>. Few would question his devotion. Few, except impeached Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> and some of his supporters. <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> happens to be the award-winning cartoonist for the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> _ and a relentless critic of the embattled governor. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> happens to be <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s first Mormon governor and an unwavering believer in conservative church doctrine. In <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> these days, politics and religion are mixing in the Mormon community. Mormon critics of <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> have been scorned by other Mormons, who say they are not true to their religion. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> even once told <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> his salvation was in jeopardy because of the biting cartoons. `` Sides have been taken and swords drawn,'' said the cartoonist. `` There have been instances of shunning. Letters have been written questioning one's devotion to the church _ whether one has the moral rectitude to remain in the flock.'' With the turmoil have come fears that the brouhaha will damage the image of Mormons, whose roots trace back to the settling of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. Officially, the church has remained neutral on the governor's plight Some members say the only mentions of <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> from the pulpit have been reminders of neutrality, and the strife is limited to a small group of Mormons. `` Is the church worried? I think not. It's a matter that will pass in the next few months,'' said <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Udall </PERSON>, a church leader designated as the official spokesman. Still, individuals within the community say passions run deep. Some say families have been split by the issues. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Pagan </PERSON>, a Mormon who is a history graduate student at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> and who criticized <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> in a letter to the editor, called the turmoil `` gut-wretching'' for church members. `` In a sense, his platform and ideology have the veneer of unofficial church position,'' said <PERSON> Pagan </PERSON>, whose criticism drew letters questioning his own faith. `` There are those who say if you criticize <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, you're ultimately criticizing God.'' An unofficial church newspaper, the Latter-Day Sentinel, has supported <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, and its editor, <PERSON> Crismon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, is a sharp critic of the Republic's <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>. `` Most of the church is extremely disappointed in him,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. One cartoon that rankled <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s Mormon supporters showed an angel atop the <ORGANIZATION> Mormon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. At the end of the angel's trumpet was a banner reading, `` Resign, Ev.'' Some remember the controversy that surrounded <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>'s grandfather during eight years as agriculture secretary under President <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> `` His grandfather was attacked so much by the press that he offered his resignation, but <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> kept him,'' said <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>. `` Now, a couple of decades later, you've got the grandson doing the same thing.'' <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> says his grandfather, a personal friend of <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s, has never pressured him to back off. Church-related pressure in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, he said, comes from an ultra-conservative sect of the church _ not the mainstream. `` Some individuals _ and it's not unique to my religion _ unavoidably mix religion with politics and as a result think any Mormon who does not agree with a fellow Latter-day Saint who happens to be governor is endangering his position in the church,'' <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> said. `` It's intolerant, and it's silly.'' And <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> has support among Mormons _ even among some who support the governor. `` He's got his job to do,'' said Republican state Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who voted against <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s impeachment. `` He can do that and still be a good member of the Mormon church.'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, a 63-year-old native of <PERSON> Duchesne </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, was impeached Feb. 5 by the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> on allegations of concealing a $ 350,000 campaign loan, misusing $ 80,000 from a special fund and attempting to thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat involving a state official. Trial on the impeachment is under way in the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. If convicted, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> would be removed from office. He also faces a criminal trial on the campaign loan charge March 22, and a recall election set for May 17. The ultra-conservative governor took office 14 months ago and immediately plunged himself into controversy by rescinding the <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> holiday for state workers and making statements that have offended women, homosexuals, Jews and Japanese. Mormons believe church leaders receive divine guidance, and some <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> backers have suggested political leaders do as well. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> himself has occassionally suggested he's received guidance from God. To <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitlock </PERSON>, active in the church and state leader of a conservative political group called the Eagle Forum, Mormons who do n't support <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> have lost their religion. `` I feel if there are other members of the church who do not support the governor they either have allowed themselves to be propagandized or are too liberal and do n't understand their own teachings,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Whitlock </PERSON> said. `` If members of the church ca n't see this man is trying to do his duty, then there's false belief,'' she said. `` If they do n't support the governor when he supports Constitutional principles, then they better do more studying. Passions ran high in the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, too, as the impeachment vote neared. Rep. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a former Mormon bishop, said he received letters from followers who tried to intimidate him. Rep. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Killian </PERSON>, a conservative Republican from <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>, a popular Mormon area and site of the church's <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>, broke into tears as he blasted the governor's behavior, but voted against the impeachment because he did n't believe the evidence was strong enough. <PERSON> Udall </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> church spokesman, said he cringes when <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s religion is brought into the debate. `` Is religion really a factor? I do n't think it is,'' he said. `` And we'd prefer not to be getting the attention.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said he worries about possible damage to the church. `` But I think people basically understand that you have different kinds of people in the church, and some are not reflective of the whole group,'' he said. `` It's a concern,'' said <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnett </PERSON>, an attorney and Mormon. `` There will be those who know <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> is a Mormon and think less of me because I'm a Mormon.'' Most Mormons, <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> bishop <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> said, `` are sorry the church has been involved in it.'' `` ut I ca n't say it's hurt any of my members,'' <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> said. `` And I ca n't say it's hurt the church. The church is just too strong for that.''

<BYLINE>GEORGE BUSH</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 I think the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are going to be looking for leadership. You know my background _ combat pilot, serving in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, meeting a payroll, building a business, ambassador to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, running the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> at a tough time and head of the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- party, and seven years standing shoulder to shoulder as vice president with a president for whom I have great respect. ... The presidency is different. It's not like <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. It's not business.

It's different. ... I think the president took the proper steps -LRB- when he learned about the Iran-Contra affair -RRB-. ... Covert action should not be run by the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-. It should be run by the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>. ... I am worried about the erosion of presidential power. ... Mistakes were made, but we must move ahead now. ... Let's try to hold the highest possible standards -LRB- of ethics -RRB-. It is an honorable profession, public life. ... I want men and women of excellence to come and serve, not to profit. ... I think that I would be the best for getting this -LRB- budget -RRB- deficit down, with a four-year freeze that allows for the growth and inflation, that will hold the line on taxes but does n't freeze in bad programs. ... I want to keep the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> strong, offering the hope of peace and freedom. ... When people go into that -LRB- voting -RRB- booth, they're going to be saying, who has the values that we believe in, who has the breadth of experience, the ability to get people to work together, and who has the integrity that we trust. ... The question is what do we do in the future? ... I believe that I have had more real life experience than anyone else running against me, and I am proud to have stood with this president through thick and through thin, through good times and bad times, without cutting and running when the going got tough.

 I come from a small farming town. I was born and raised in the values that come from deep roots, deep faith and an abiding love of country. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, may be a long way off from <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> on the map, but we share a lot of the same values. We know the importance of family, of neighbors helping neighbor, of sticking together in good times and bad. ... I learned ... that if you worked hard and really believed, you could overcome hardships and build a better tomorrow. And if your country called _ in war or peace _ you served. ... That's how I've always tried to live my life. And that's the kind of president our country will need to lead us into the 21st century. Values and leadership _ that's what this crucial election is all about. And, this year ... the South will play a key role in choosing the man who will sit across the table from Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. ... The people ... must look at the record and decide which candidate has demonstrated the strength it takes to stand tough, to make the hard choices, to forge a consensus that will lead this nation forward. Which candidate's leadership got President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s tax cut passed. Whose leadership stopped the liberals from repealing those tax cuts. Whose leadership put together the plan which saved Social Security from bankruptcy. Whose leadership produced a majority of votes in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for aid to the Nicaraguan freedom fighters. Whose leadership lined up the votes to keep the president's Strategic Defense Initiative alive And whose leadership produced the 1985 farm bill to save the family farm. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> led each one of the battles in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. And we won. No other candidate in this race can match that record. No one. That's the true test of leadership. Not how many jobs we've had, but what you've done in the jobs you've held. And that speaks volumes for what you'll do as president. There's no instant, magic formula to make the deficit vanish. But, with the right leadership, we can start solving the problem. There's no miracle cure to make freedom safe in a dangerous world. But the right leadership can do it. There's no quick fix to make <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> competitive again, an opportunity society where all our people can rise as high as their God-given talents will take them. But leadership can make it happen. There's no easy way out of the plague of drug abuse, the decline in values and education, the high cost of health care and so many other urgent problems. But they can be solved. These are all tough challenges. It's going to take tough, dedicated, understanding leadership to overcome them. ... I believe that I can deliver the kind of leadership we need.

 No public policy decision we make in the next 10 years ... will be as important as the decisions we make about defending and nurturing and strengthening the bedrock of Western values _ our families and our children. There is no better school, no better engine of economic growth or job training, savings and investment than the traditional family. There is no greater moral teacher, disciplinarian, help for the weak, protector of the young, or builder of character than the family. Our Democratic friends urge us to look to government as mother and father, but they have it exactly backwards. ... I believe that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> needs a rebirth of respect and compassion for the value and the dignity and the sanctity of each and every child and every human life. ... I have pledged that, as president, I will help lead <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to its highest standards of educational excellence _ not by expanding budgets or new government programs, but through reforms that stress the ABCs of education: A _ restoring accountability by granting parents greater oversight and greater choice. ... B _ renewing stronger emphasis on a basic core curriculum of English, science, math, history and computer and vocational skills and expecting superior levels of achievement to be met. C _ building and developing character. ... We've put forth a three-part plan to stop the spread of AIDS: First, routine testing to help identify those infected; second, confidential sharing of this information by public health authorities with those in danger of infection; and, third, common sense education that teaches right and wrong about the sexual behavior that spreads AIDS. We must do everything we can to find a cure. We must treat AIDS victims with compassion and give them care. But we must also give the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people confidence that we have a plan and that we will stop AIDS, now, not later. ... Our liberal friends tell us that we need ... activist judges. Well, I agree. We need activist judges who actively support the Constitution. We live in a democracy and it is the right and the responsibility of the people and their representatives to decide fundamental questions of public policy _ it is not, and must never be the right and responsibility of judicial elites to appropriate that right and responsibility to themselves.

 If we are to recapture the greatness of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> we must go back to our fundamental faith in God. And when we train our children ... it is absolutely crucial that we teach them the moral values of our society. Little children must once again be allowed to pray in the schools of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. When our ancestors came to these shores ... there was one thing that was uppermost in the minds of the people. They believed in individual self-reliance. ... When they went across these plains ... when they made an empire out of a wilderness ... when they fought disease and battled enemies, when they endured privation, hunger and starvation, they relied on their own initiative under God. And if we are going to be strong we must recognize that we as a people can do it ourselves. Government does n't give us our freedom. Government ca n't take our freedom away from us. It is a gift of God given every one of us. ... We have built in this nation with 200 years of labor a magnificent industrial base. But over the last few years of this decade we have seen our industries slowly crumbling, some of our basic industries going overseas to other nations. ... Recently I was in one of the Southern states and I learned of 1,000 factories that have closed. I learned of 300,000 people who lost their jobs. And they told me about them, and they said: Are you aware that imports to this country of the particular product they were mentioning, textiles, from mainland <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> have risen from 230 million yards to 1.8 billion yards. ... Are you aware, they told me, that from January of 1986 until November of 1987 that imports of textiles from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had risen by 7,000 percent. ... If the communist countries want to help their workers, that's fine ... But I think the time has come in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> when we no longer are going to allow our basic industries to be destroyed and our people put out of work in order to enhance the standard of living of communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and communist <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>. ... Recently, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> refused to vote military aid to assist the freedom fighters of the Contras in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. I do not think it is in the best interest of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to permit the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to establish a land base in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> continent.

<TEXT>
 Reaganomics is n't economic theory, it's theft from our children, it's a felony against the future, and it has played the hard-working, taxpaying families of middle <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> for fools. We're not going to get our fiscal house in order with more voodoo economics. And we're not going to meet the challenges of the 1990s by building walls around <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. We tried that 60 years ago and it gave us the worst depression in our history. We need more trade, not less. One and a quarter million Southern workers depend on exports for their jobs. They know that if we're going to make <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> No 1 again, we've got to do more than wave a fist at our foreign competitors; we've got to roll up our sleeves, go to work, and beat them. They deserve a president who knows how to balance a budget and mop up Republican red ink _ and has done it. A president who knows how to build a strong economy _ and has done it. A president who has been tested in the fires of debt and deficit and hard economic times. A president with the strength, the skills and the values to take charge of our economic future and get our nation moving again. ... It's going to take hard workers, not high-rollers, to get <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> moving again. And it'll take Star Schools, not Star Wars, to conquer the next American frontier. The world is changing; we must change with it _ or we'll be left behind. We must invest in research. We must invest in new ideas. And we must turn those new ideas into new products and new jobs for our citizens and new markets for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. ... American workers know that we're not going to beat the Japanese and our other competitors by sitting on the sidelines; we're not going to beat them by pitting group against group and region against region; we're not going to beat them by investing in a fantasy called Star Wars; and we're not going to beat them unless we've got someone in the White House who looks a little farther into the future than the next vote on Contra aid. ... There are no shortcuts to greatness for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Because the best <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> does not hide; it competes. The best <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> does not waste; it invests. The best <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> does not leave some of its citizens behind; it works for everyone.

 If Americans want leadership to trim and then tend to things as they are, they will turn to the Republicans. Our purpose, and our appeal as Democrats, has always been to serve as an instrument of change. ... The central issue of this campaign is whether Americans will regain control of our own destiny. In recent years, that control has been lost to foreign powers and private interests. ... First, we lost much of our steel industry; now we are losing whole segments of the computer industry. First, we were told that free trade permitted our farmers to sell abroad; now they are being locked out of the European market. We devalue the dollar, hoping to sell our goods cheaper abroad _ and then trade barriers still bar the way _ and the trade deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> roars on. ... We refuse to accept the decline of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. We are tried to hearing from those who say it is inevitable ... that we ca n't stand up for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> anymore. And we are determined that we can and will reassert this nation's rightful role of leadership in the world economy. ... On the central economic issues of this campaign, there is hardly a dime's worth of difference between Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and Senator <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>. And while I may disagree with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in a number of important areas, let me say in fairness that he is speaking to fundamental questions _ and he surely does have something to say about them. The Gore-Dukakis approach is to distract the voters from those fundamental questions _ to divert the campaign to tactics, or drown it in generalities. ... This approach is a political danger for Democrats; the stale and standard rhetoric of a careful, conventional politics will never bring us back the voters we need for victory. But the true danger is to the nation. We can no longer afford to ignore the larger forces that could constrict our economy and our future. We have to revive <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s productive might. ... I am not willing to see <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> fall behind. I do not doubt the energy, the capacity, the strength or the talent of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people. And I am certain that if they are given the chance, this nation can and will continue to lead the world.

 We want a nominee who does n't just appeal to a collection of narrow interest agendas. We want a nominee who speaks common sense to voters at the grass roots level. ... And my campaign is about bringing the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> back to the grass roots level. I want to put the White House back on the side of the average working men and women in this country. ... Voters ... have asked themselves: Is the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> straying from its traditions? Well, our traditions are economic growth, jobs, prosperity, social progress with a movement toward social justice and a strong, intelligent role for this country in the world. Now that's the tradition of <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Roosevelt </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. ... That's the approach that I'm taking in my campaign. ... This is a time for fundamental change in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. We are facing a storm on the horizon. We must understand it clearly. ... We must become one nation, united in clearly recognizing that in order to compete more effectively overseas we have to batten down the hatches and make some major changes in this nation. ... We have to create the best schools in the world. ... I look at children in all the states around this nation where I compete. Their eyes are just as bright, their minds are just as sharp as those of the children of any nation on the face of this Earth. Are we to be satisfied that by the time children graduate from high school in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, on average they are two full grade levels behind their counterparts in other nations? Are we going to allow that to continue? ... It's time we had a president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> who did n't act the way <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> does and every time a decision comes up ask, `` What is going to best for the executives in the board room?'' It's time we asked the Democratic question, `` What's best for the guy on the assembly line, the guy on the farm, the woman behind the word processor, the woman behind the typewriter. ... This is the challenge. ... We know from experience that if we follow policies that are designed to help the person at the grass roots level, ... if we consistently have the guts and fortitude and leadership and courage to stand by them and follow policies to benefit them, then in the long run that is going to lift the prospects of the entire nation.

 For more than a decade I've worked with others to create ideas that reform our public policies and systems. Many of our society's institutions require reform But reform is a threatening notion. It threatens long-established arrangements among individuals and institutions and powerful positions that some have fought long and hard to win. Reform can not be imposed from the top down, especially against a hostile institution. It must percolate from the bottom up. That means that ordinary people must provide the fuel for change. Soldiers, nurses, teachers, workers are the key to reform. And that reform can only begin when people begin to think differently. We have to think differently about our relationships with the Soviets and how we engage them in a new and different world. We have to think differently about how we provide better medical care and for whom we should provide. We have to think differently about how we educate our young people and what kind of education we are providing. We have to think differently about how we manufacture goods as well as what kind of products we ought to be making. We must raise non-traditional, non-conventional questions in this election year because the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been desperately trying to preserve an elusive status quo for 25 years while an often brutally contrary world prevents it. ... Resistance to reform and change is resistance to a new generation and a new way of thinking, and the resistance to me and my candidacy is in large part a resistance to a new generational understanding of a world where the old arrangements and old rules no longer work. But it's not simply an age question, it's an attitudinal divide. ... Although most in this race are of the same generation, there are real differences in outlook and attitude among the candidates. ... This campaign _ like every other presidential campaign _ is about power, who will serve in the most powerful office on Earth. But it's also about who has the power to elect our national leader. Traditional politics says that party leaders, pundits and political experts should decide who the candidates will be. But reform politics, new politics, my politics say let's let the people decide.

 We gather here in this new South with new challenges. Every generation has faced the challenge of securing for all citizens equal protection under the law, to have the umbrella of law broadened so when the rains do fall, all are protected. In 1960, four students in <LOCATION> Greensboro </LOCATION>, at A & amp; T, -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> A </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s alma mater -RRB- went to <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION>'s lunch counter They sat in to get hamburgers; they got handcuffs. They were challenged. They were arrested. They chose dignity even over degrees. They heard the call of their day. Throughout that period, young <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> did not just rest in false comforts, or retreat through drugs ... young Americans led the way, and assumed a front-line position. It's not enough for you to vote for me, young Americans. You must register, vote, run for office, win and make a difference. Things will not change automatically and inevitably. They will change because you work to make them change. You must make it happen. ... We do have a public accommodations bill, and that's progress. We do have the right to vote, and that's progress. We do have open housing, and that's progress. We do have equal access to education, and that's progress. But then there is the unfinished business of economic justice and world peace. Let us not forget the garbage workers in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> had civil rights, had the right to vote. When they came home from work ... they did not have enough money to pay their basic family bills. The agenda there was economic justice for working people who did not want welfare, did n't want workfare, they wanted to get paid for working. The agenda was economic justice. They were abandoned by law. ... Now we need the law to raise the minimum wage ... to establish a national health care plan for the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people. We need to change the law and choose Head Start and day care over jail care and welfare. ... We the people must come together. ... We must struggle to raise the standard of living for working people. Stop drugs from coming in. Stop jobs from going out. The challenge was to make certain that no one with a sheet and a hood would lynch us. Today's challenge ... is not the rope, it's dope <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION>. Crack. Heroin. PCP. Every gain we ever made is threatened by drugs. It's a cop-out to just say to children, ` just say no to drugs.' ... Children do not buy $ 150 billion worth of drugs. ... Children do not grow the drugs, do not run the cartels. The money involved in drug smuggling is corrupting whole governments. ... We must stop the flow of drugs into our country. It's corrupting our society. If elected, I will ... cut the supply of drugs. But you the people must cut the demand for drugs.

 We have to see that jobs are there for people, good jobs, primarily through the private sector. One of the things we have to do is deal with those who have fallen through the cracks. We have something in our society called the underclass. Some people do n't like the use of the term, but it is real, it is there. There is no sense fooling ourselves. We ought to give the people an opportunity. ... We can do better as a nation. We're not just talking statistics. ... We're talking about people. We're talking about the young man ... desperate for a job ... the man whose business has failed -LRB- who -RRB- asked the question, `` Does anyone care?'' Only he really was n't asking a question. He was really saying, `` No one cares.'' I want a government that cares. I want a government that's going to fight for opportunities for our people and stand up for the less-fortunate. Education has to receive much greater attention. ... One of things that has been happening is that there has been a substantial shift away from grants to loans. Now, there are problems with that. One of the problems is that sometimes two of you who have loans fall in love and decide to get married. And that means that you have to postpone that dream of a family and a home. When you postpone that dream of a home you know what happens, among other things? For the lumber industry in the state of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, all kinds of other things happen. It's also more costly for the federal government, believe it or not, than grants, because we have to subsidize interest for a great many years. And we have to pay for defaults. ... It also distorts what people do. ... You have to make a decision to handle those loans. Do you become an elementary school teacher? Or do you become a lawyer. ... Our society needs a great many more good elementary school teachers today than we need lawyers. ... Long-term care. ... Let's talk about your grandparents, your parents. We have to take care of them if they need long-term residential care. ... No other major industrial society on the face of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> does n't take care of parents and grandparents when they need most any care. Can we do it? Of course we can do it.

 <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stevens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, months ago a rumored takeover target, now finds itself fielding three rival offers from a management-led group, industry competitor <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point-Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and an undisclosed suitor. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point-Pepperell </LOCATION> said Tuesday it had offered to pay $ 56 a share for <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, or about $ 867 million, in a negotiated buyout. The textile company actually had delivered its offer to <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> late Monday. On Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stevens </ORGANIZATION> management group led by Chairman <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said it was increasing its own outstanding leveraged buyout offer to $ 55 a share in cash and securities, or about $ 850 million. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> also disclosed it had received a third, unidentified offer. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> stock jumped $ 6.25 a share to $ 54.50 Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point-Pepperell </LOCATION> was unchanged at $ 30.50 a share. The management group offered to pay $ 40 in cash and $ 15 in securities for each of <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' 15.5 million common shares outstanding in a leveraged buyout. The group, led by the fifth generation member of the family that founded <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> in 1813, initially offered on Feb. 8 to pay a total of $ 43 a share in cash and securities, or about $ 666.5 million. West Point said its $ 56 a share cash offer was not conditioned on the availability of financing and indicated it was considering the sale of certain <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> assets to avoid antitrust concerns. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> indicated in a news release that its outside directors were reviewing the revised management proposal and had authorized the company's financial advisers to study the two outside proposals. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, declined to comment beyond the news release. A number of industry experts had predicted higher offers would emerge following the management group's initial offer, which widely was viewed as too low. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> is one of the nation's biggest textile producers, concentrating on home fashion textiles such as sheets, towels and carpets under the brand names <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON>, <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardin </PERSON>. The company also makes automotive products and industrial fabrics. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, based in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, also is a major household fabrics maker, producing brands such a Arrow, Martex, <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepperell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Burberry </PERSON>'s and Cabin Crafts. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lanier </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chairman of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point-Pepperell </LOCATION>, said an acquisition of <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> would be a natural step in his company's shift toward consumer goods and away from commodity textiles, which have lower profit margins and suffer from intense foreign competition <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point-Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> acquired <ORGANIZATION> Cluett-Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 as part of the strategy. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> undertook a similar strategy beginning in 1984, moving out of apparel fabrics and shifting its manufacturing to home textiles such as sheets and towels. The success of that effort is one factor that made <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> an attractive takeover target. `` That's one of the great strengths of <PERSON> J.P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Lanier </PERSON> said in an interview. `` It's playing to our strength as we see it.'' During the quarter ended Jan. 30, <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> posted an after-tax profit of $ 12.9 million, up from $ 11.9 million a year earlier. Sales rose to $ 381.48 million from $ 361.67 million a year earlier. In the fiscal year ended Oct. 31, <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> earned $ 56 million on sales of $ 1.6 billion. This compared with a profit of $ 53.7 million on revenue of $ 1.68 billion in 1986. <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point-Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> reported a profit of $ 25.5 million on revenue of $ 480.9 million for the fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 26. That was up from $ 20.9 million in profit and $ 422.7 million in revenue during a year earlier. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said the securities portion of the management group's offer would include $ 10 in market value of junior subordinated debentures and $ 5 market value of preferred stock paying a dividend in cash or additional shares

 <ORGANIZATION> Apollo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> got a key jump on its competitors by developing a $ 70,000 desktop `` personal supercomputer'' the company says is faster than anything else in the market, industry analysts said. Two other companies also announced new supercomputers Tuesday, marking what promises to be a period of fierce competition among makers of sophisticated supercomputers used by scientists and engineers. `` This seems to be the year for the so-called ` personal supercomputer,''' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smaby </PERSON>, who follows the industry for <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jaffray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Hopwood </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. `` I think it's going to be an interesting horse race.'' Apollo said it was producing a workstation for scientists and engineers with supercomputer power that outperforms anything in its price range of $ 69,900 to $ 130,000. Analysts said the Domain Series 10000 returns the <LOCATION> Chelmsford </LOCATION>, Mass.-based company to the forefront of the highly competitive field of small, powerful workstations that combine extremely rapid `` number cruching'' with three-dimensional graphics. `` We think that this definitely positions them as the performance leader to beat in the new graphics supercomputing market,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Burdick </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Dataquest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` For a company that has been stuck in the <LOCATION> Saragasso </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> in the past couple of years, it is very siginificant'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellomy </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Framingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. `` They had been the industry leaders in every aspect and had fallen behind in every aspect.'' <ORGANIZATION> Ardent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Sunnyvale </LOCATION>, Calif.-based start-up, announced its first product Tuesday, a graphics supercomputer in about the same price and performance range as Apollo's. <ORGANIZATION> Convex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Richardson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, aiming at a pricier segment of the market, unveiled a more powerful new line of mini-supercomputers it hopes will cut into <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s domination of that market Another recent start-up, <ORGANIZATION> Stellar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Newton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, is expected to announce a similar graphics supercomputer in two weeks, and analysts anticipate a half-dozen more to follow. `` Scientists and engineers are making pretty interesting use of these computers,'' <PERSON> Smaby </PERSON> said. `` The question is how big a market is there for a $ 100,000 single-user computer.'' `` They're all vying for market share leadership in one niche or another and not all of them are going to come out with gold medals,'' he said. Apollo, which pioneered workstations in 1980, said at a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> news conference that the new model speeds up complex numerical computations and its four-processor model allows several different programs to run simultaneously. Ardent said its graphics supercomputer would range in price from $ 79,000 for a one-processor model to $ 150,000 for a four-processor model that will be available later this year. Ardent, founded in 1985, is run by two prominent figures in the computer industry: <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michels </PERSON>, the president and chief executive, who previously founded <ORGANIZATION> Convergent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, the vice president of research, engineering and development, who did pioneering work in a 23-year career at <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. But analysts agree Apollo's 50,000 workstations and 1,800 software packages already on the market give it a competitive advantage. The company said it will begin selling the models in the third quarter this year and announce improved graphics system for the workstation later this year. Convex Computer introduced a line of six mini-supercomputers that range in power up to the level of conventional supercomputers. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, Convex said it invented a new kind of parallel processing for its bigger models that keeps processors from being idle by allocating work among them efficiently. Convex's new computers range in price from $ 275,000 to $ 1.3 million and are up to 10 times as powerful as its current models. Convex claimed the most powerful model, the C240, is faster than <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s X-MP 14, which costs $ 5.5 million.

<HEAD>Heyman Group Sweetens GAF Buyout Offer; Shareholders To Decide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WAYNE, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> shareholders will have the chance to vote on a sweetened $ 1.4 billion leveraged buyout offer from a group led by Chairman <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Heyman </PERSON>, but may get competing offers to consider. <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors agreed Tuesday to submit the offer to shareholders `` without endorsement,'' after the group increased its bid from a previous $ 1.35 billion cash and securities package. The company also instructed its financial adviser to seek out other potential purchasers, and left itself the option of accepting any competing, superior offer. The <PERSON> Heyman </PERSON> group on Tuesday proposed to pay $ 46 in cash and junior securities with a face value of $ 6.50 for each of <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION>'s 27.7 million outstanding common shares. In December, the <PERSON> Heyman </PERSON> group offered $ 1.35 billion, or $ 40 in cash and $ 8.50 in securities per share. That offer was a downward revision from its initial $ 2.3 billion offer, made in September, of $ 64 in cash and $ 2.50 face value in debt securities. <PERSON> Heyman </PERSON> revised the initial proposal due to rising interest rates stemming from unsettled conditions in the market for high-yield `` junk bonds'' following the October stock market crash. In order for shareholders to vote on the latest buyout offer, they first first vote on an amendment to the company charter. The amendment would allow shareholders to act in place of the board in considering a merger offer, as the Heyman-led proposal has been presented. A special committee of the board of directors had rejected the initial $ 64-a-share proposal as inadequate. <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> said it had decided to let stockholders decide based on the favorable opinion of the offer by <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the committee's financial adviser. The committee also instructed <PERSON> Salomon </PERSON> to solicit other possible purchasers, <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> said. The committee said that if it receives an `` economically superior alternative proposal'' for <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION>, it could cancel its agreement with the buyout group. `` We think the price is a fare and full price,'' <PERSON> Heyman </PERSON> said. `` It's seven times the price of the stock only four years ago.'' <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> also said it had reached tentative settlements of lawsuits brought in connection with the buyout offer. <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> stock rose 25 cents to $ 50.25 a share Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Heyman </PERSON>, who wrested control of <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> in 1983 after a bitter proxy fight to oust former Chairman <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Werner </PERSON>, has said that taking <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> private would give the company more leeway to pursue acquisitions without having to worry about short-term shareholder value. Since taking over <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Heyman </PERSON> has led the company on unsuccessful but profitable attempted takeovers of <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Borg-Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Heyman </PERSON> owns 2.8 million shares of <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION>, or about 10 percent of its outstanding stock

<TEXT>
 Ten years ago a <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION> company promoting membership at a new <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> coast resort hotel offered a special deal: `` Buy now and your 10-year lease will be renewed at the same price in 1988.'' But inflation and the devaluation of the peso since then have made the deal even more special than anyone anticipated: the average 70,000 peso price for the leases in 1978, worth the equivalent of $ 3,182 back then, now equals just $ 30. Hotel clients in this northern industrial city are complaining that the company is balking at renewing the time-sharing leases at the cheaper price. They estimate that about 1,000 people throughout <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> paid an average of 70,000 pesos in 1978 to spend one week each year at the luxury hotel Club Maeva in <LOCATION> Manzanillo </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> coastal state of <LOCATION> Colima </LOCATION>. The hotel is run by <PERSON> Casolar </PERSON>, the tourism division of the huge Monterrey-based Alfa conglomerate. Alfa fell into a severe economic crisis along with the rest of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in 1982 and has seen the value of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s currency plunge from 22 pesos to the dollar in 1978 to 2,350 to the dollar now. The peso devaluation has made the 70,000-peso fee equal to $ 30, about the price of dinner for two in a nice restaurant. But clients here say they took the gamble a decade ago when they invested in a hotel complex that was under construction. `` We know it's very little money now. But, remember, nothing was built at the time. It was an enormous risk,'' said <PERSON> Concepcion </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON>, who sold herself one of the contracts 10 years ago when she worked as a Casolar sales representative. Her son, <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON>, says <PERSON> Casolar </PERSON> now wants to charge 10 million pesos _ $ 4,255 _ to renew the contract. <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON> is handling the complaints for about 60 hotel clients here. `` The company did n't have any idea that things were going to turn out as they did. But the people that bought there did n't expect the company to decide whether or not it was going to comply,'' <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON> said <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrios </PERSON> of <PERSON> Casolar </PERSON> said on Monday and Tuesday that officials involved in the contract dispute were in meetings or out of town and not available for comment. <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON> said in a telephone interview late Monday that his clients want him to negotiate with <PERSON> Casolar </PERSON>, but he has been unable to locate company officials. `` These people had to sacrifice to pay the fee 10 years ago, but they thought they'd get 20 years of vacations,'' <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON> said. He said the peso-dollar equivalent had nothing to do with the written contract. The renewal offer was in the contract as well as the company's advertising, he said. `` We do n't earn dollars or spend dollars or do business in dollars,'' he said. `` We still have faith in what a contract says.''

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> KaiserTech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> has taken the unusual step of suing its own chairman of the board, in an attempt to recover profits made from his short-term dealings in the aluminum company's stock The suit filed Tuesday against <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clore </PERSON> came a day after the reclusive British investor agreed to sell his 27 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> KaiserTech </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oilman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurwitz </PERSON>, a move that appeared to irritate <ORGANIZATION> KaiserTech </ORGANIZATION> officials and signaled management turbulence at the <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION>, Calif.-based company. <PERSON> Clore </PERSON> acquired his position at <ORGANIZATION> KaiserTech </ORGANIZATION> after a lengthy takeover struggle last year. <PERSON> Hurwitz </PERSON>'s intentions toward <ORGANIZATION> KaiserTech </ORGANIZATION> remain unclear. Asked if it was considered unusual that a company would sue its own chairman, <ORGANIZATION> KaiserTech </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Irelan </PERSON> said: `` It's the first time we've done it. <ORGANIZATION> KaiserTech </ORGANIZATION> stated that its suit filed in a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> federal court resulted from <PERSON> Clore </PERSON>'s disclosures in a <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> filing on Monday about his sale of stock to a Hurwitz-controlled company, Los Angeles-based <ORGANIZATION> Maxxam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> KaiserTech </ORGANIZATION> contended the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> disclosures showed <PERSON> Clore </PERSON> and his affiliates made about $ 4 million in undisclosed profits via so-called `` short-swing trading'' _ trading done within a six-month period _ of <ORGANIZATION> KaiserTech </ORGANIZATION> stock Under federal securities law, a company or its stockholders are entitled to recover such profits from a director or officer who engages in short-swing trading. <PERSON> Clore </PERSON>, who usually resides in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, could not be reached for comment on the lawsuit, which was part of a rapid series of events concerning <ORGANIZATION> KaiserTech </ORGANIZATION> stock. In <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Jefferies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said it was selling 1.39 million shares of <ORGANIZATION> KaiserTech </ORGANIZATION> stock to <ORGANIZATION> Maxxam </ORGANIZATION> for $ 16.68 million or $ 12 a share. Combined with the 6.2 million shares acquired from <PERSON> Clore </PERSON>, plus an option to buy his 8.2 million convertible preferred <ORGANIZATION> KaiserTech </ORGANIZATION> shares, acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Jefferies </ORGANIZATION>' stake would give <ORGANIZATION> Maxxam </ORGANIZATION> about one-third of <ORGANIZATION> KaiserTech </ORGANIZATION>'s approximately 45 million shares outstanding. But Wall Street's reaction indicated skepticism about a possible takeover move. In composite <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading, <ORGANIZATION> KaiserTech </ORGANIZATION> fell 12 -LCB- cents a share to $ 11.75, after rising $ 1.12 -LCB- in the previous session. <ORGANIZATION> KaiserTech </ORGANIZATION> had stated Monday it would have preferred that <PERSON> Clore </PERSON> had sold his stock to a broader range of investors, reflecting concern about what <ORGANIZATION> Maxxam </ORGANIZATION> intended to do with its stake. <ORGANIZATION> Maxxam </ORGANIZATION> officials said it was premature to speculate on whether the comapny would attempt to acquire more <ORGANIZATION> KaiserTech </ORGANIZATION> shares. <PERSON> Clore </PERSON>'s maneuvering to sell his <ORGANIZATION> KaiserTech </ORGANIZATION> shares came against a background of heavy pressure on him to cut losses suffered in the October stock market crash. If <PERSON> Clore </PERSON> had n't found a buyer by a Monday deadline, he could have faced default on loans he had obtained by using <PERSON> Kaiser </PERSON> stock as collateral. After the stock plunged in October, lenders wanted repayment. His sale of stock came as the company was rebounding from six straight years of losses. <PERSON> Kaiser </PERSON> has sold its chemical, oil and gas businesses, slashed debt and concentrated on its core aluminum business.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Lorillard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> tobacco company sought to downplay discounts that its insurance company affiliate was considering offering to non-smokers several years ago, according to evidence in a lawsuit against three cigarette makers. The contention was made Tuesday as a federal jury heard testimony and read documents that allegedly show the tobacco industry sought to suppress information on the health dangers of smoking. The suit filed by <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lakehurst </LOCATION>, claims <ORGANIZATION> Lorillard </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, are liable for the lung cancer death of his wife <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, a 40-year smoker. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> alleges the companies failed to do enough research on cigarettes, did not reveal what they did know, failed to warn the public of health dangers and did not put a safer product on the market. One document released Tuesday, dated March 3, 1980, was written by Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> CNA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> officials and discussed a recommendation for non-smoker discounts, according to <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Z. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>'s attorney. At the time, <ORGANIZATION> CNA </ORGANIZATION> was owned by <ORGANIZATION> Loew </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theatres </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which also owned <ORGANIZATION> Lorillard </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Loew </PERSON>'s has since sold the tobacco company. `` It is recognized that the introduction of non-smokers discount could prove embarrassing'' to <PERSON> Loew </PERSON>'s and <ORGANIZATION> Lorillard </ORGANIZATION>, the memo stated. In order to minimize the potential for embarrassment, it suggested that <ORGANIZATION> CNA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Lorillard </ORGANIZATION> jointly prepare a carefully constructed statement saying the discount `` in no way supports or refutes the contention that smoking causes health defects.'' `` CNA should further refrain from advertising or otherwise promoting non-smoker discounts,'' it continued. The issue also was discussed in a letter dated Nov. 5, 1979, from <ORGANIZATION> Lorillard </ORGANIZATION> senior vice president and general counsel, <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, to <ORGANIZATION> CNA </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Noha </PERSON>. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> wrote that when the cigarette manufacturing trade group, the <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insitute </ORGANIZATION>, heard of <ORGANIZATION> Allstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s plan to offer a non-smoker discount the institute sought help from <ORGANIZATION> CNA </ORGANIZATION> `` in an effort to perhaps dissuade <ORGANIZATION> Allstate </ORGANIZATION> from that course of action by supplying background data.'' <ORGANIZATION> Lorillard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Lorillard </ORGANIZATION> and the institute did nothing improper but merely were trying to counteract anti-cigarette propaganda. According to another document released Tuesday, a <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> official stated in 1972 that the industry's defense against cigarette critics included `` creating doubt about the health charge without actually denying it.'' The internal memorandum describes the `` three major fronts'' _ litigation, politics and public opinion _ where the tobacco companies had fought to defend itself. The `` brilliantly conceived and executed'' strategy, used in all three areas, helped `` win important battles,'' said the memo. However, `` it is only fair to say that it is not _ nor was it intended to be _ a vehicle for victory,'' said the May 1, 1972 memo from <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Panzer </PERSON> to <PERSON> Horace </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kornegay </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. Wall identified <PERSON> Panzer </PERSON> as an institute vice president. The document says the industry had followed a `` holding strategy, consisting of: _ creating doubt about the health charge without actually denying it; _ advocating the public's right to smoke, without actually urging them to take up the practice; _ encouraging objective scientific research as the only way to resolve the question of health

 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s plastic-body, mid-engine <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fiero </LOCATION> and the workers who make it have become the first victims of slumping popularity for sporty two-seaters. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Losh </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION>'s general manager, said Tuesday <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> will stop making the Fiero after the 1988 model and will close indefinitely the single Fiero plant here sometime this summer, idling 1,109 workers. `` The whole market's dead,'' said industry analyst <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Cedergren </PERSON> of J.D. <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, blaming high insurance rates for a 30 percent drop in overall two-seater sales during 1987. The slump has not spared Japanese automakers, who report slow sales of cars such as the sporty Toyota MR2 and the Mazda RX7, or Europeans, whose victims include four-cylinder Porsches. In addition to flagging sales, <PERSON> Fiero </PERSON> had suffered problems that included frequent engine fires, which prompted <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> to recall the entire 1984 mode production run late last year. But <PERSON> Losh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cedergren </PERSON> suggested the market killed the Fiero. `` We have seen a switch away from the high volumes of people who were willing to buy two-seat cars with limited luggage capacity,'' <PERSON> Losh </PERSON> said. `` We led the world into this -LRB- market -RRB- segment and we may lead a piece of the world out of it.'' Fiero sales peaked at 101,720 cars in 1984 and fell to 47,156 in 1987. Sales for the 1988 model year, which began Oct. 1, are less than 10,000, 41 below the same point in the 1987 model year. But before it died, <PERSON> Losh </PERSON> said, the <PERSON> Fiero </PERSON> helped create a new, performance-oriented image for <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION>. He refused to speculate on whether the Fiero plant might reopen to build a new <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION> or GM product. Union and city officials said they were surprised by the Fiero decision despite the car's poor sales. When the Fiero is gone, no Pontiacs will be built in <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> Local 653 President <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> said his plant was one of the first at <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> to accept Japanese-style team organization of workers under a contract that allowed the previously closed plant to reopen in 1983 to make the Fiero. `` We're going to continue to try to persuade <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> to try to put something in there,'' <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> said. `` It's a slap in our face that they rewarded us this way.'' <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> already has closed a foundry, another car assembly plant, a heavy-duty truck plant and a bus plant in <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION> and had cut production at the Fiero plant several times, putting more than 1,200 other Fiero workers on layoff. Dealers said they also were surprised by the announcement and some expressed disappointment. `` We do n't have anything else in my opinion that would fit in that category,'' said <PERSON> Buzz </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyers </PERSON>, owner of <LOCATION> Sawyers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Lansing </LOCATION>. `` It's like a cheap Corvette.'' <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Reginald </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> will make sure parts are available for the Fiero into the future. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s contract with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union forbids permanent plant closings that were not announced before the contract was signed last fall, but permits laying off workers if sales slow. The Fiero plant is the third <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> has decided to idle since then. The first, in <LOCATION> Framingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, will return to production in May. The second, in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, will shut down April 15, idling 1,600 workers.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a leading producer of building materials, has urged shareholders to resist a $ 1.9 billion tender offer from a partnership led by two <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oilmen. The $ 42-a-share offer for about 21.5 million shares of <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION> stock was unveiled Tuesday by <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LP </ORGANIZATION>, which is headed by <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cyril </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> already owns about 9.9 percent or 5.08 million of <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION>'s approximately 50.8 million shares outstanding After the tender offer was announced, <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement asking shareholders to hold onto their stock until the board had a chance to act on the matter. The company has stated repeatedly that it wants to remain independent. Lasat week <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION> rejected the partnership's lateset takeover proposal, also valued at $ 42 a share. In a separate filing with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> said it would seek to elect six directors to <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION>'s 15-member board at the company's annual meeting in May. <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> had pledged $ 500 million in financing for the offer and would attempt to arrange $ 525 million more in financing from other banks. Wall Street analysts have speculated that <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> are n't interested in acquiring USG but want to boost the value of their stake, purchased last year for about $ 44.30 a share for an earlier takeover attempt that fizzled. In recent weeks USG stock had been trading around $ 28 a share, but the price started rising when rumors surfaced late last month that <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> would make another run at the company. USG rose $ 2.75 to $ 40.12 -LCB- on the New York Stock Exchange Tuesday.

<HEAD>Belgian National Bank Cuts Discount, Lombard Rate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s central bank on Wednesday announced cuts in two key interest rates to reflect the current strength of the Belgian franc and international trends. The Belgian national bank said it will lower the discount rate to 6.5 percent from 6.75 percent and the Lombard rate to 6.75 percent from 7 percent, effective Thursday. The discount rate is the interest the central bank charges to member banks. The Lombard rate is interest charged on central bank loans that use securities as collateral. The bank said in a statement the decision was made `` in recognition of recent rate cuts in the domestic and international money markets'' and due to the stability of the Belgian franc. The bank last cut its Lombard and discount rates on January 28. The three-month money market rate, the single-most important leading rate on the Belgian market, also has been cut five times since the beginning of the year. Foreign exchange dealers in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> said the franc had not registered any noticeable reaction to the news.

<HEAD>Flight Attendants Urged To Begin Legal Slowdown</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAGAN, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Teamsters union is urging <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' 6,700 flight attendants to use whatever measures they can to slow their performance without breaking the law or company rules. `` At this time we want to keep the company confused and very busy,'' said a recorded message that answered a union telephone Tuesday. The recording urged tactics that included filing paperwork on each piece of broken equipment at each stop during a flight and slowing down everyday procedures the flight attendants have learned to shorten. `` What they're doing is not against regulations,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Musto </PERSON>, a spokesman for Teamsters Local 2747. `` It's just following the rules.'' The flight attendants, who are working without a contract, threatened to strike at 11:01 p.m. last Friday, but no job actions have been taken against the company, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wren </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. Talks broke off at dawn Saturday, and no further negotiations were scheduled, spokesmen for both sides said. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Erskine </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for law and labor relations, said Monday an unusually high number of flight attendants called in sick over the weekend. But he attributed the absences to attendants' fears they would be stranded by a strike, not to orders from the union. `` We're winding down operations here today, letting the dust settle for the time being,'' said <PERSON> Musto </PERSON>. `` There's still a possibility of a strike and we're free to strike at any time,'' <PERSON> Musto </PERSON> added. The main stumbling block to a new contract is a company proposal to delay the promotion of B-scale workers to the higher-paid A-scale bracket, <PERSON> Musto </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wren </PERSON> said. All <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> flight attendants were paid under one scale before a 1982 contract created the B-scale, <PERSON> Musto </PERSON> said, while all employees hired since then have started as B-scale employees at rates of pay lower than the old system. The 1982 contract called for B-scale employees to jump to A-scale levels in their sixth year of employment, but the current company proposal would extend that wait until the ninth year of employment, <PERSON> Musto </PERSON> said. Such an extension would mean a loss off $ 16,776 over the three years for the average B-scale flight attendant, <PERSON> Musto </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>System to `Inoculate' Against Computer `Viruses' Announced</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> company is offering to `` inoculate'' computers against `` viruses,'' or rogue programs that are designed to spread from computer to computer and damage data the computers store. The Viralarm system was announced Tuesday by officials of <ORGANIZATION> Lasertrieve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Metuchen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, during a <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> conference on a data-storage device known as CD-ROM, short for compact disk, read-only memory. A statement issued by <PERSON> Lasertrieve </PERSON> said that although the newer CD-ROM disks are impervious to corruption because information on them can not be altered, many computer users are concerned about protecting programs on hard disks or on conventional floppy diskettes. Viruses are creating a growing fear among computer owners and users. Authorities in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> recently announced the detection of a virus that, if left to spread unchecked, could have wiped out memory banks and disabled computers throughout the country on a given date. Previous `` anti-viral'' programs only drew attention to changes, noted the size of a program or monitored the dates of program changes, and all were `` easily fooled by sophisticated viruses,'' the statement said. Viralarm consists of a special program to protect another program, creating a software barrier. Before anyone can use the protected program, Viralarm checks to determine whether the program has been altered since it was inoculated. If there has been any change, <PERSON> Viralarm </PERSON> then blocks use of the altered program, notifies the user and suggests a backup copy of the program be substituted. The protection is available for individual personal computers and works for most of the operating systems now available, the Lasertrieve statement said.

^New Home Sales Plunge In January</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sales of new homes plunged 9 percent in January, pushing the level of sales activity to its lowest point since the end of the last recession, the government reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said that sales dropped to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 535,000 units. It was the third consecutive monthly decline and left sales 26 percent below where they were a year ago. The January decline followed decreases of 6.8 percent in December and 3.4 percent in November as the housing industry continued to be the sector of the economy that has been hardest hit since the October collapse of stock prices. Consumers, worried about the future following the record 508-point drop in stock prices, stopped looking for new homes, analysts believe. Housing is often the economic sector which turns down first before the start of a new recession. But despite the weakness in recent months, many economists remain hopeful that recent declines in mortgage rates will spur a rebound in sales and construction in the months ahead. If the rebound does n't occur, then concerns about a possible recession this year could increase. In another weak economic report, the government said today that orders to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories for manufactured goods fell 0.6 percent in January, the first decline since a 1.4 percent drop last August. However, analysts said the January setback was not as weak as it appeared because it mainly reflected a huge swing in orders for aircraft, which had helped push factory orders up 2 percent in December. The 9 percent decline in new home sales in January was the steppest decline since a 10.9 percent drop last May. It left sales at the lowest annual rate since December 1982, when the last recession was ending. The big sales decline was accompanied by a sharp rise in prices, with the median, or mid-point price of a home climbing 9.7 percent to $ 120,000. The average price of a home rose to $ 149,000, up 10.5 percent from December. Economists said such a big price surge is not uncommon during a period of falling sales because fewer, but higher-priced homes skew the averages. The sales decline was led by a 24.4 percent drop in sales in the South. Sales were down 13.7 percent in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. Sales actually rose 23 percent in the Northeast, a rebound from a 52.9 percent drop the month before. Sales were up 0.6 percent in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 January new-home sales hit the lowest point since the last recession and factory orders fell for the first time in four months, the government said today in reports suggesting the economy weakened after the October stock crash. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said sales of new homes plunged 9 percent in January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 535,000 units, the third straight monthly decline that left sales 26 percent below year-earlier levels. The report reflected a significant downturn in the housing industry, the area of the economy believed hardest hit since the collapse in stock prices five months ago. Analysts believe many homebuyers stopped looking after the collapse, fearing economic uncertainty in months ahead. Housing is often the economic sector that declines first before the start of a new recession. Despite the weakness, however, many economists remain hopeful that recent declines in mortgage rates will spur a sales rebound. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> also said orders to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories fell 0.6 percent in January, the first decline since a 1.4 percent drop last August and another possible sign of post-crash economic weakness. But some analysts said the report was misleading because it reflected a huge swing in aircraft orders, which helped push factory orders up 2 percent in December. Discounting the aircraft element, factory orders would have risen 0.8 percent in January, reflecting a higher demand for American manufactured goods caused partly by the weaker dollar, which makes them more affordable abroad. The reports today appeared to have no dampening effect on domestic financial markets, where early stock and bond prices rose. On Tuesday, the markets wandered aimlessly after the release of other economic statistics that gave no clear signals. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said its chief barometer of future economic activity fell in January, although an upward revision of December's figure eased fears that the nation was headed for a recession. The department also said construction spending fell an unexpected 2.9 percent in January, the biggest decline in 10 months, evidence of weakness in all sectors of the building industry. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 1.16 points to 2,070.46, slipping from the post-Oct. 19 market crash high it had reached on Monday It was equally quiet in the credit markets, with the yield on the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s bellwether 30-year bond edging up to 8.35 percent from Monday's 8.34 percent. The dollar was narrowly mixed in foreign exchange.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Is a frog livestock? People would n't leap to that conclusion, a farmer-lawmaker suggested Wednesday, arguing that frog farmers need tax protection. Farms for frogs should be exempt from local property taxes, just as are any premises used for any `` livestock,'' Conservative <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Colvin </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> committee studying a local finance bill. According to the bill, livestock is defined as `` any mammal or bird kept for the production of food or wool, or for the purpose of its use in the farming of land.'' All other farm premises are also exempt from the taxes. Fine, but where does the frog, an amphibian, fit in? asked <PERSON> Colvin </PERSON>, who said his acquaintance with a frog farmer prompted him to raise the point. `` The definition of livestock is most unclear. Times have changed in agriculture,'' he said, suggesting that the bill substitute `` creatures'' for `` livestock.'' `` It would be a sad day if any government started imposing a tax on frogs,'' said <PERSON> Colvin </PERSON>. Local Government Minister <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> pointed out that words are n't everything under law. After all, he said, `` snails are covered by the exemption for fish farms.''

 Customers who pay hundreds of dollars on fine china expect perfect curlicues, flawless border lines and unblemished garlands. Perfection can be achieved electronically on a computer screen, but that's not good enough for the designers at <LOCATION> Lenox </LOCATION>. In an era in which computers influence the shape of cars, lay out balanced newspaper pages and even make a superstar out of <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Headroom </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lenox </PERSON> still has old-fashioned ideas about its designs. Every line, squiggle or tiny dot in the prototype design is laboriously drawn by hand after weeks of research. `` We start with a strategist ... who analyzes the marketplace,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> McInerney </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Lenox </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president of marketing. Some recent new designs, for instance, have been focused toward young cosmopolitan consumers `` who are less traditional, a bit more urban,'' he said. `` Once a direction has been established, we draw up a design brief ... and the design department then takes that direction.'' At <LOCATION> Lenox </LOCATION>, a design team of 17 people sits down to brainstorm. Eventually it comes down to a designer at a drawing board, a blank circle waiting to be embellished. <PERSON> Lenox </PERSON> will not reveal the names of its designers, `` for competitive reasons,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Lenox </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheyney </PERSON>. But the director of the design department explains some facts, such as a source of inspiration. `` We have a large library with books on architectural style, furnishings, fabrics,'' he said. `` We have color services who are constantly bringing us up to date with predictions for this season's hot colors.'' Computers, he said. `` are not for us here. A computer could be used to help with color separations or to work out the permutations of design, but it's more of a graphic tool.'' Lenox designs `` are done all by hand,'' the design director said. `` In some instances, a computer can help with key outlines, but it really comes down to the eye. ... A computer will never substitute for a person here.'' Every few weeks, the design team produces 30 to 60 patterns that are test-marketed. Of that group, about six are selected for production. The design team works closely with <PERSON> Lenox </PERSON>'s sculptors to ensure that the design will fit on a plate. `` The design is also checked with the factory to see if we're doing something manufacturable,'' the design director said <LOCATION> Lenox </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is a division of <ORGANIZATION> Lenox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which is a subsidiary of the <ORGANIZATION> Brown-Forman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, Ky. Sales figures for <ORGANIZATION> Lenox </ORGANIZATION> china products are included in the company's overall `` home furnishings'' report, which also comprises <LOCATION> Lenox </LOCATION> crystal products, figurines and specialty products, not all of which are produced in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The home furnishings category listed 1987 sales of $ 194.2 million, compared to $ 173.9 million in 1986. In a year, <ORGANIZATION> Lenox </ORGANIZATION> will introduce about 60 new patterns. Once a design is approved, it moves to <ORGANIZATION> Lenox </ORGANIZATION>'s massive factory about 10 miles outside of <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> where it is printed on decals and applied by hand. The assembly line for the decal application process consists of all women who make small talk as they work. `` For some reason, guys do n't like to do this tedious work,'' said <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hickey </PERSON>. In her 33 years with <LOCATION> Lenox </LOCATION>, she has risen to a spot of such seniority that she is entrusted with decorating First Lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s presidential china and giftware. On a wet plate that already has been fired twice, the women center the designs and smooth out air bubbles. `` Sometimes it still has a tendency to slide, especially on the curvature of the plate,'' said <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinkney </PERSON>, carefully positioning tiny flowers scattered across the china. Several feet away, the process of applying gold and platinum borders is so exacting that workers are allowed to get up and stretch frequently. `` It requires steady hands and steady nerves,'' said a 23-year Lenox veteran, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wise </PERSON>, as he spun a wheel to draw the gold off the brush and onto the china. Mrs. <PERSON> Hickey </PERSON> is especially proud of <PERSON> Lenox </PERSON>'s design selections. She keeps volumes of every design that <PERSON> Lenox </PERSON> has produced, from the popular `` Autumn'' pattern that features tiny hand-painted fruits to the more current presidential line _ <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>, <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> and <PERSON> McKinley </PERSON>. After seeing hundreds of patterns, Mrs. <PERSON> Hickey </PERSON> laughs when asked if she has a favorite. `` Do you want to know what I picked for my own china? I have the plain Solitaire,'' she said. `` I just could n't make up my mind what I wanted.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> says it has sold $ 1.1 billion of 10-year notes, making it the largest investment-grade corporate debt issue in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The previous record was held by <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which issued $ 1 billion worth of investment-grade debentures two years ago, according to <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>'s underwriters. <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> said it had planned to sell $ 750 million worth of bonds, but demand was so great the amount was increased to the record level. The 10-year bonds were priced at par and carry an interest rate of 9.125 percent. The issue will be used to either retire about $ 1 billion of short-term loans or help finance the company's recent $ 5.1 billion acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Sterling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> has traditionally tried to stay out of the credit markets.

 Grain and soybean futures opened mostly lower today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as the slightly stronger dollar gave a weaker tone to the entire market.

 Thousands of farmers wrestling with massive debts or being forced out of business may get another chance under new loan rules being drawn up by the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> agency said today. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, an FmHA spokesman, said the new rules probably will be ready by June. In many cases, over-burdened borrowers could have much of their debt written off, trimmed back to reflect their assets in hopes of keeping them in business. However, <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> said he had no estimate of how much debt the <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION> might write off under the new rules. `` There's just no way of knowing,'' <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> said. `` It'll be each individual case all the way through.'' At the end of last fiscal year on Sept. 30, he said, 261,291 <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION> borrowers owed the agency about $ 26 billion. Of that, 127,671 were delinquent, owing $ 6.6 billion, including principal and interest. New rules governing how the agency deals with farmers who owe it money could help prevent 100,000 farms from going under, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today, quoting <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Agency officials also said thousands of farmers who went bankrupt over the past 10 years could find themselves back in operation. The new rules are a result of a bill passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in December calling on the <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION>, an agency that serves as a `` lender of last resort'' for the nation's farmers, to go easier on farmers who are behind in their payments. The new law requires the agency to do whatever possible to restructure loans in order to keep FmHA borrowers in business. `` Our attitude is going to be different,'' said <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>. `` We want to make the new act work, and we're going to have a lot of room to maneuver to restructure these loans.'' <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, an attorney with the <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, said, `` I'm thrilled they are apparently taking this legislation seriously and are trying to make it work.'' The new regulations would enable debt-burdened farmers to stay in business through a number of loan restructuring options. According to agency officials, farmers would be offered the opportunity to pay off loans at a lower rate of interest over a longer period of time. As a last resort, the agency could write off debts in excess of a borrower's assets, <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> said. For example, if a farmer's assets were $ 150,000 and debts totaled $ 500,000, the write-off could be as much as $ 350,000 if the FmHA determined the farmer could handle the remainder by staying in business `` It makes sense, then, to keep that person in business and write off the difference between what they owe and their assets _ if the government stands a chance of retrieving more by keeping that farmer going,'' <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> said.

 Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> failed to unravel a tangled three-way dispute this morning that has blocked legislation to repeal the Depression-era law separating commercial banking and the securities industry. Committee members, after meeting more than two hours behind closed doors on Tuesday, struck a tentative deal that balanced the interests of banks, securities firms and insurance companies, according to <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> aides who spoke on condition of anonymity. But the agreement fell apart almost immediately. The compromise would have given bank holding companies more securities powers, but restricted their ability to expand into insurance, the aides said. However, it fell apart when senators on opposite sides of the insurance issue realized they had a different understanding of the agreement, the aides said. Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, D-Wis., the committee chairman, called another negotiating session for later in the day An aide said the nature of the restriction on banks' ability to enter the insurance business remained the sticking point in the talks. Legislation sponsored by <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Garn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, the committee's senior <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION>, would repeal the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act, which forbids commercial banks from underwriting and selling most securities. It was passed in the wake of the 1929 stock market crash to preserve the safety of the banking system. Affiliates of bank holding companies would be allowed immediately to begin underwriting mortgage-backed securities, commercial paper, municipal revenue bonds and securities backed by consumer loans. Power to underwrite corporate debt would be postponed until Jan. 1 and corporate stock underwriting by bank affiliates would begin in 1990. Sen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Mich., chairman of the securities subcommittee, was advocating more restrictive legislation that would have required separate congressional votes in 1989, 1990 and 1991 before bank affiliates could underwrite corporate bonds, stocks and mutual funds The tentative compromise, according to the aides, would have automatically phased in power over corporate bonds and mutual funds and required a separate vote in the future only on stock underwriting. Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, a Democrat from <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, where insurance companies are important employers, was pushing an amendment that would prohibit state-chartered banks owned by holding companies from further expansion into insurance. Opposition from banks to <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>'s amendment, if passed, could kill the entire bill, aides said, but some senators were reluctant to vote against the amendment for fear of retaliation from insurance interests within their states. One version of the compromise on insurance, as described by the aides, would have allowed a state to permit its banks to underwrite insurance within the state even if the holding company that owned the bank was headquartered out of state. However, banks would not be allowed to locate in a state with permissive laws and then `` export'' insurance to other states. A second, more restrictive, version of the compromise would require both the bank and its parent company to be located within a state before state officials could allow the bank to underwrite insurance. <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> and <PERSON> Garn </PERSON> opened the all-day session Tuesday with a plea to fellow senators to ignore pressure from special interest lobbyists. `` We are not here to merely broker a compromise between the various providers of financial services,'' <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Garn </PERSON>, looking at a hearing room packed with lobbyists, said, `` It's time to forget all of you and your special interests and your greed.'' The Proxmire-Garn bill has been endorsed by the heads of all the relevant regulatory agencies and by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, but it faces substantial hurdles even beyond the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee before it can be enacted. Reps. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., and <PERSON> Fernand </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> St </PERSON> <PERSON> Germain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, who will have jurisdiction over the issue in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, have expressed considerable reluctance about broadening bank powers too much

<HEAD>Deposits Drop 8 Percent Amid Takeover Rumors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 First RepublicBank <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> lost more than 8 percent of its deposits as customers withdrew $ 599 million in one week last month amid speculation about the financial health of its parent company, regulators said. The <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> bank is the lead institution of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, whose officials said the situation subsequently appeared to be stabilizing. The bank held average total deposits of $ 6.87 billion during the seven-day period ended Feb. 24, down 8.7 percent from $ 7.47 billion the previous week and down $ 1.5 billion from the period including Dec. 31, 1987. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Fronterhouse </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION>, said the one-week outflow of deposits at the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> bank was `` unusual,'' but added that the bank's funding situation `` appeared to be stabilizing.'' During the week covered in the report by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION>, the bank holding company was the subject of published reports that takeover or bailout negotiations were under way, and that its lead institution had suffered deposit outflows. A 55-member team supervised by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency began auditing <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION>, which lost $ 656.8 million in 1987 and finished the year with $ 3.92 billion worth of problem assets. Bank officials later denied that the negotiations were taking place. Fronterhouse said the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> bank's recent deposit loss `` reflects mainly the impact of earlier false rumors and extensive adverse publicity. `` By the middle of last week, the sources of funds for the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> bank and for the corporation as a whole appeared to be stabilizing,'' Fronterhouse said.

 The dollar strengthened against most major currencies Wednesday. Gold prices stagnated or rose slightly. Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar firmed on two rumors: that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration would allow the dollar to rise if American trade figures continue to improve and that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was buying dollars. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar gained against the British pound when the state-run Bank of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> sold an undetermined amount of pounds to keep the currency below 3.0 West German marks as the mark fell against the dollar. At the end of the day, one pound cost $ 1.7680, cheaper than $ 1.7775 late Tuesday. Other late rates for the dollar in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> compared with late Tuesday rates included: 1.6945 West German marks, up from 1.6855; 1.4005 Swiss francs, up from 1.3915; 5.7345 French francs, up from 5.7065; 1.9013 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8940; 1,247 Italian lire, up from 1,244.35; 1.2558 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2570.

<HEAD>U.S. Manufacturers Seek More Use of American Parts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT MACY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Manufacturers of American auto parts are huddling with executives of 11 Japanese car companies in an effort to whittle away at a $ 6 billion trade deficit between the two countries in the auto parts industry. Executives of the New Jersey-based <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> say the current meetings are unprecedented, and offer an opportunity to cut the massive trade deficit between the two countries. The meetings are being held Wednesday and Thursday between members of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> group and purchasing agents of companies belonging to the <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The meetings are aimed at putting more American-made replacement parts under the hoods of Japanese cars, according to <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Raftery </PERSON>, president of the auto parts organization. `` We believe the Japanese recognize the seriousness of the situation and are prepared to do something about it,'' <PERSON> Raftery </PERSON> said between meetings Wednesday. Japanese auto parts companies are shipping $ 5 billion a year in parts to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Raftery </PERSON> said. Some of the parts go to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> car companies, others are destined for Japanese cars that are sold in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, or to Japanese companies producing cars in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` The Japanese are buying more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> auto parts now that they are setting up factories here, but they are not purchasing nearly enough <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> parts,'' <PERSON> Raftery </PERSON> said. `` The problem is that the Japanese have been encouraging Japanese suppliers to follow them to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and open plants here. That does n't provide new jobs, and it takes away <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> jobs. `` When a foreign manufacturer opens a plant in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, whether the company is Japanese, German or whatever, they hire far fewer people than a similar American company,'' <PERSON> Raftery </PERSON> said. When a foreign company builds a plant in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, they import more of their parts and tend to be in the assembly business rather than the manufacturing business, he said. If the Japanese are going to sell their cars in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and take advantage of the new car market in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, `` they should give the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturer the opportunity to provide parts for some of those vehicles, as long as we're price competitive,'' he said. Only a very small percentage of Japanese cars use American-made parts while `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies are using Japanese parts, Korean parts and Taiwanese parts,'' he said. The Japanese are buying `` a few hundred million dollars'' in auto parts from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies while exporting billions of dollars in their own auto parts to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, he said. He said the Japanese association is cooperating fully `` and has been extremely helpful in bringing these negotiations about.''

<HEAD>Troubled Running Gear Firm, Licking Wounds, Settles in Montana</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Once a darling of the running-gear boom, <ORGANIZATION> Moss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> stumbled on its way to becoming a $ 100 million-a-year business in the nation's capital. Now, its founder is starting over in a storefront 80 miles northwest of Yellowstone National Park. The grain elevators and muddy pickup trucks in this tiny farming community are a far cry from the pricey <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION> section of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Barksdale </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Moss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> built a reputation as a rising star of the running and outdoor clothing mail-order business. In the heady days of 1984, <PERSON> Barksdale </PERSON> was pictured on the cover of the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Moss </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> was named to <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> magazine's list of the 500 fastest growing companies in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Barksdale </PERSON>'s boom went bust in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> _ the victim, some said, of trying to run too fast _ and after working through a Chapter 11 bankruptcy court reorganization, his enterprise has emerged with a new name and a relatively clean slate. `` As far as I know of, everyone has been taken care of,'' <PERSON> Barksdale </PERSON> says of the customers who filed claims against <PERSON> Moss </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> for undelivered merchandise. <PERSON> Barksdale </PERSON>'s new firm, appropriately called <ORGANIZATION> Runwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, has acquired the <PERSON> Moss </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> trademark, but the company is a much smaller and perhaps less ambitious version of the original. Back in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Barksdale </PERSON> thought nothing of firing off 12 million catalogs and churning out Gore-Tex running suits by the tens of thousands. Today, in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>, employees take a more leisurely pace, quietly stuffing garments into mailing envelopes by hand while listening to music on a radio. `` I feel really welcome here,'' the 59-year-old <PERSON> Barksdale </PERSON> told the <PERSON> Bozeman </PERSON> -LRB- Mont. -RRB- Daily Chronicle in a recent interview. `` Everybody is so open. It's sort of like when I was a kid growing up in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. I'd forgotten that people were really like that.'' While describing banks in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as `` basically just computers,'' <PERSON> Barksdale </PERSON> says the vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Belgrade </ORGANIZATION> walked over and introduced himself the day <PERSON> Barksdale </PERSON> moved in. `` That's a different experience than you'd have back in <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>,'' he said. With $ 8 million in sales in 1984, <PERSON> Moss </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> was being hailed as the L.L. Bean of the running set. `` If we were doing $ 15 million a year in sales, I'd probably still be there,'' <PERSON> Barksdale </PERSON> said. `` But I'm not sure I'd be happy.'' What happened to him in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is a classic case of reaching too far too fast. `` We made good money until 1983,'' when <PERSON> Moss </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> earned $ 200,000 in profits, <PERSON> Barksdale </PERSON> said. `` Then I decided to turn it into a big company.'' From mailing orders in the back of his <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION> retail store, <PERSON> Barksdale </PERSON> moved the mail-order business into a 40,000-square-foot warehouse in suburban <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. And he expanded the mailing list, achieving those 10 million to 12 million mailings a year, by purchasing or renting costly mailing lists from other firms These expansion moves added huge costs to the business without adding enough revenues to pay for them _ at a time when the running boom was beginning to fade. `` We added customers faster than we were able to generate merchandise,'' <PERSON> Barksdale </PERSON> admits. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Chilcutt </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Direct </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION>, an <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, broker of mailing lists for mail-order companies, agrees with that sober assessment. <PERSON> Barksdale </PERSON> was `` prospecting'' for new customers by leasing or buying millions of new names to add to his mailing list, <PERSON> Chilcutt </PERSON> said, but his known buyers could n't support the expansion. `` You ca n't support a 10 million mailing with only 123,000 customers,'' <PERSON> Chilcutt </PERSON> said. Last March, <PERSON> Moss </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> filed for bankruptcy protection, having piled up $ 2.15 million in debts, $ 1.7 million of it unsecured. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmstrup </PERSON>, an investigator at the City of <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>'s office of consumer affairs, says his office received some 150 complaints from customers of <PERSON> Moss </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, most coming at the end of 1986 and in early 1987 Customers complained <PERSON> Moss </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> never sent the merchandise they ordered, even though the company billed customers' credit cards or cashed customers' checks, <PERSON> Holmstrup </PERSON> says. After mailing new catalogs to customers and offering credits to those who filed complaints, <PERSON> Barksdale </PERSON> contends his debts have been settled. And he says he gets letters daily from people saying they are glad he's back in business. But this time, <PERSON> Barksdale </PERSON> says he'll be satisfied with being small in beautiful <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. Asked about his goal for the fledgling, reorganized company, he says he'd like to see sales of $ 1 million a year by 1989. `` I do n't want to get that big anymore,'' he said. `` We made a lot of money and had a lot of fun, but my wife would kill me if I make the business even as big as $ 5 million again.''

The restructuring, which will trim an as-yet undertermined number of people from the merchandise group's management, will make <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> stores more responsive to customer needs and wants, officials said. `` The apparel business will be run differently from the hardware business,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Philo </PERSON> <PERSON> Holland </PERSON>. `` You need different organizational structures to compete in different businesses.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bozic </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of the merchandising group, said in a statement that the restructuring would reduce the number of management levels, making each segment of <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' merchandise business leaner and more independent. `` We are competing in many diverse businesses, each with its own unique structure, and -LRB- we -RRB- have been essentially using one organizational format to compete in all of these businesses,'' <PERSON> Bozic </PERSON> said. `` The changes we make will result in a company that is better structured to maintain its position as <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s premier retailer.'' Officials said they had no estimate of the number of employees to be affected or the cost savings involved, because they were only beginning the restructuring procss. `` The ultimate size and structure will be determined by how we choose to compete in the different businesses we are restructuring,'' <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> said. He said the reduction in management personnel would be achieved through attrition and a severance offer of two weeks' salary for each year of service, up to a maximum of 52 weeks. Employees at least 50 years old who have been with the company at least 10 years will also be offered early retirement benefits, <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> said. The reorganization is widely seen as an attempt to revive sluggish sales and profits within the merchandise group, which accounts for nearly 60 percent of the company's revenues.

But as has been the case for the past couple of months, broader market measures were generally strong Wednesday, reflecting continuing interest in many depressed secondary issues.

 Bond prices rose modestly in light trading Wednesday, as the government provided more evidence of economic sluggishness. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s key 30-year bond rose -RRB- point, or about $ 3.75 for every $ 1,000 in face value, as its yield slipped to 8.31 percent from 8.35 percent late Tuesday. Trading has been very light this week, and analysts ascribe that to consternation about whether the economy is headed into a recession or simply slowing down. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, director of money market research at <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the bond market was `` marking time'' until Friday's scheduled release of February employment figures. The employment figures are usually the first economic statistics released for any given month and they provide the most recent evidence available on general economic activity. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said one factor contributing to the mild bond price rise on Wednesday was a new <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report that said sales of new homes fell 9 percent in January. `` The report showed surprising weakness for the third month in row,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. A slow-growing economy is generally viewed positively by bond traders because it usually means credit demand will be weak, allowing room for interest rates to fall. In another report, the government said orders to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories for manufactured goods fell 0.6 percent in January, the first decline since August. In the secondary market for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds, prices of short-term governments rose 2-32 point, intermediate maturities rose \ point and 20-year issues rose 11-32 point, the financial information service <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> reported. The movement of a point equals a change of $ 10 in the price of a bond with a $ 1,000 face value. The <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Index </ORGANIZATION>, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, rose 0.14 to 113.93. The <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Bond Index, which makes a similar measurement, rose 1.82 to 1,192.20. Among corporate bonds, industrials and utilities rose -LRB- point in light trading, the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, rose 0.42 to 286.13. Yields on three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills fell 2 basis points to 5.60 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Six-month bills fell 6 basis points to 5.85 percent and year bills fell 2 basis points to 6.16 percent. The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, traded at 6 -LCB- percent, down from 6 | percent late Tuesday

<TEXT>
 The dollar strengthened in foreign exchange trading Wednesday, especially against the Japanese yen, partly because of a rumor that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration would tolerate a higher value for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency. Gold prices were narrowly mixed. As of 4 p.m. EST, <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted bullion at $ 430.25 a troy ounce, down 20 cents from the price quoted late Tuesday. Dealers attributed much of the dollar's strength to a rumor that an unidentified senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official had told Japanese reporters the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would allow the dollar to move higher following its protracted decline. Although this story was denied later, many traders scrambled to buy the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency, causing it to rise in the most active trading of the week against most key currencies except the Canadian dollar. `` It was a bit more energetic today,'' said <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Soria </PERSON>, vice president and foreign exchange manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> branch Nevertheless, he said the relatively narrow trading ranges for the dollar vs. other currencies that have emerged recently would persist for awhile. `` I do n't see any breakout one way or the other,'' <PERSON> Soria </PERSON> said. Many foreign-exchange dealers were focusing on the release later this month of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign trade figures for January to gain more insight into how to structure their trading strategies. If those figures provide more evidence of a declining deficit, as shown by statistics of the previous two months, a moderate rally in the dollar would likely result. If the January deficit widens, dealers probably would sell dollars on the theory that the currency will depreciate further in value to stimulate <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> exports. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar closed at 128.47 Japanese yen, up from 128.30 Tuesday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> the dollar traded at 129.27 yen. By the time trading concluded in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar was worth 129.40 yen, more than 1 yen higher than 128.32 yen rate quoted late Tuesday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the pound cost $ 1.7680, cheaper than $ 1.7775 late Tuesday. Later in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the pound was worth $ 1.7673, cheaper than $ 1.7766 late Tuesday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> compared with late Tuesday included: 1.6969 West German marks, up from 1.6864; 1.4030 Swiss francs, up from 1.3916; 1.2570 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2578; 5.7385 French francs, up from 5.7100; 1,248.25 Italian lire, up from 1,243.25. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> vs. late Tuesday included: 1.6945 West German marks, up from 1.6855; 1.4005 Swiss francs, up from 1.3915; 5.7345 French francs, up from 5.7065; 1.9013 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8940; 1,247 Italian lire, up from 1,244.35; 1.2558 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2570. Gold bullion rose in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to $ 429.50 a troy ounce vs. $ 428.70 late Tuesday. It was unchanged in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION> at $ 429.50. In <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> gold traded at $ 433.96 vs. $ 433.80. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, gold bullion for current delivery fell 20 cents a troy ounce to $ 430.80. Silver bullion traded late in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at $ 6.24 a troy ounce, down from $ 6.29. On the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Comex </LOCATION>, silver bullion for current delivery traded at $ 6.21 cents an ounce, off about 1 cent.

<HEAD>Cocoa Futures Continue To Slide On Surplus Production Fears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Cocoa futures prices set new life-of-contract lows for the fourth consecutive day Wednesday on fears that the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> will be unable to control the effects of steadily rising production. On other markets, grain and soybean futures retreated; livestock and meat were mixed; precious metals were slightly lower; energy futures were mostly lower; and stock-index futures advanced. No news from the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s week-long meeting in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> was perceived as bad news on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where prices for future delivery of cocoa settled as much as $ 35 a ton below Tuesday's final prices. `` The market continues to try and absorb prospects for surplus production,'' said <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaul </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` It's falling pretty sharply.'' Cocoa producer and consumer nations are meeting to discuss withholding cocoa from the market to support prices, Ms. <PERSON> Kaul </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> ICCO </ORGANIZATION> buffer-stock buying, a price-support mechanism that was resumed in January after a six-month suspension, has already exhausted the allocation of 250,000 metric tons for the 1987-88 marketing year, she said. World cocoa production has risen steadily since 1986 and is expected to total more than 2 million metric tons this year. Cocoa settled $ 31 to $ 35 lower with the contract for delivery in March at $ 1,563 a metric ton. Grain and soybean futures finished lower on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> after an attempt to rally the soybean market failed, analysts said. Wheat came under additional pressure from the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s revised auction program designed to lower surplus stocks. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> announced after the close it had sold 10 million bushels of wheat, the agency's targeted amount, on Tuesday. Auctions also were scheduled for Wednesday and Friday, and three more are set for next week. Wheat settled 3 cents to 4 -LCB- cents lower with March at $ 3.06 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 1 -RCB- cents to 2 -RCB- cents lower with March at $ 2.02 a bushel; oats were \ cent to 1 \ cents lower with March at $ 1.93 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 4 \ cents to 5 -RCB- cents lower with March at $ 6.30 -LCB- a Live cattle futures settled higher while feeder cattle prices moved lower in choppy trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Cattle futures have traded within a narrow range for more than a month. Hog futures finished slightly lower in light, technically based trading. Frozen pork bellies advanced on expectations that discount pricing at the wholesale level would encourage sales of pork products. Live cattle were .17 cent to .38 cent higher with April at 72.12 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .45 cent lower with March at 80.27 cents a pound; hogs were .08 cent to .22 cent lower with April at 43.25 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .23 cent to .67 cent higher with March at 52.27 cents a pound. Gold futures have encountered support at around $ 430 a troy ounce for the April contract, which settled slightly above that level on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Commodity Exchange. Gold settled 10 cents to 20 cents lower with April at $ 432.20 a troy ounce; silver was .50 cent to 1 cent lower with March at $ 6.216 a troy ounce. Oil futures prices finished mostly lower on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> after struggling back from a sharp selloff earlier in the day. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled .12 cent lower to .13 cent higher with April at $ 15.67 a barrel; heating oil was .15 cent lower to .46 cent higher with April at 43.93 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .05 cent to .39 cent lower with April at 44.90 cents a gallon. Stock-index futures settled slightly higher on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for March delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index ended .70 point higher at 268.35. The underlying spot index finished .75 point higher at 267.98.

<HEAD>Troubled Florida Company Buys Stalled Dunes Casino</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The financially troubled Dunes Casino Hotel project here has been sold to a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> company with its own troubled history of lawsuits, cash shortages and federal investigations, federal documents show. The <ORGANIZATION> Royale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, a company in the hotel and real estate business, recently bought out nearly all the stock in the Dunes, according to documents filed with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and reviewed by The Press of <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The Dunes project at the southern end of the Boardwalk stalled in 1979 when the owners ran out of money. Its bare steel girders have stood rusting ever since. Developer <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Bona </PERSON> arrived in 1983 to rescue the casino but was forced to file for bankruptcy protection in August 1985. Since then, <PERSON> Bona </PERSON> has tried several other plans to raise money to pay off his debts, including a sale of shares and private deals with investors. All have failed. <PERSON> Royale </PERSON>'s chief executive officer since 1981 has been <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelullo </PERSON>, a leader in the effort to restore a strip of art deco-style hotels on <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pelullo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bona </PERSON> have tried to keep the deal for the Dunes quiet. A <ORGANIZATION> Royale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> vice president refers all questions about the sale to company attorneys, who say they can not provide details. So far, no one in <LOCATION> Royale </LOCATION> has said anything about how the company plans to raise the approximately $ 250 million needed to complete the casino hotel. <PERSON> Royale </PERSON> has been trying to break into the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> casino industry for a decade. Then called <ORGANIZATION> Cavanaugh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the company first bought marina land in 1978 but was unable to put together financing for a casino. Documents obtained by The Press from the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> say that Boardwalk to <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Royale </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, has purchased 99 percent of the Dunes stock from Bona and has an option to buy the other 1 percent. <PERSON> Pelullo </PERSON> and his companies have been involved in nearly three dozen separate lawsuits and actions by government agencies, according to company documents filed with the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>. Many were filed by banks over the alleged failure to repay millions of dollars worth of loans, the newspaper reported. <PERSON> Pelullo </PERSON>'s business dealings spawned a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grand jury investigation in 1986, the newspaper said. According to <PERSON> Royale </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> filings, the investigation centers on the circumstances surrounding a $ 13 million mortgage granted to <ORGANIZATION> Royale </ORGANIZATION> by a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> savings and loan

<HEAD>Atari Earnings Rise 57 Percent In Fourth Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SUNNYVALE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Atari </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday said its earnings rose 57 percent to $ 18.7 million in the fourth quarter of 1987 and credited part of the jump to its October acquisition of the <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> chain of retail electronics stores. Other factors contributing to the increase included strengthened computer sales in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and booming video game sales in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON>, company spokesman. The fourth-quarter figure represented 32 cents a share, on revenue of $ 277 million. That compared with earnings of $ 11.9 million, or 22 cents per share, on revenue of $ 92.6 million in the same 1986 period. Sales of televisions, stereos, microwave ovens and other electronics equipment at <PERSON> Federated </PERSON>'s 68 stores in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> accounted for 47 percent of revenues, or $ 130.6 million. Profits for all of 1987 rose 76 percent to $ 44.1 million, or 76 cents per share, from $ 25 million, or 53 cents in 1986. Sales rose 91 percent, increasing to $ 493 million in 1987 compared to $ 258 million the previous year. `` Video games were obviously a hot category this year,'' said <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON>. `` There were no teddy bears or laser guns to take those dollars away. People went back to more traditional stuff and bought video games.'' <PERSON> Federated </PERSON> stores now acount for 25 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Atari </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, one of the world's largest manufacturers of personal computers and video games.

<HEAD>Home Sales, Factory Orders Down; Stocks Flat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 New home sales dropped sharply and factory orders slipped in January, according to government reports Wednesday that reflected weakness in the economy. Bond prices strengthened in a typical reaction to news of a sluggish economy. The yield on the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s key 30-year bond slipped to 8.31 percent from 8.35 percent. On Wall Street, stocks rose marginally as the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks edged up 0.83 to 2,071.29. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> took another opportunity to calm concerns that the central bank would respond to political pressure and ease credit too much in an election year. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that even if the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> wanted to drive down interest rates sharply, `` we would fail,'' because markets would likely resist such a move and `` would run away from us.'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> also called for new efforts to cut the federal budget deficit, including a 15-cent gasoline tax and measures to trim Social Security and other entitlement programs. In spite of the news of sluggishness on Wednesday, stock analysts said Wall Street was still taking courage from a report on Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on its index of leading economic indicators. With an upward revision of the December figure for the index from a decline to a gain, it no longer showed a string of three consecutive lower readings. New home sales fell 9 percent in January, pushing sales activity to its slowest pace since the end of the last recession, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. A downturn in housing has often been the harbinger of the onset of a recession, but analysts said they believed falling mortgage rates offered the hope of a rebound in home sales in coming months. In a second lackluster economic report, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said orders for manufactured goods fell 0.6 percent in January to a seasonally adjusted $ 212.6 billion. While this was the first decline in five months, analysts noted that it followed an unusually large 2 percent December increase, a gain which reflected a big jump in demand for jet airplanes. Analysts said the one-month setback did nothing to change their view that American manufacturers are continuing to enjoy a sales boom led by increased demand for exports. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON>, chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>, said with `` mortgage rates moving in the right direction'' sales for all of 1988 should end up only 3 percent below the 1987 sales pace. But other analysts said it remained to be seen whether the drop in mortgage rates will be enough to attract new buyers. They noted that sales have been strong for the past three years and a lot of pent-up demand has been exhausted. `` We simply do n't have the demand for housing that we had in the first part of the rcovery,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sumichrast </PERSON>, an economist and publisher of a construction industry newsletter. `` The South, which accounts for almost half of all new homes sold, is still weak and you wo n't see any significant improvement until that area turns around.'' Banks recorded their least profitable year since the Great Depression in 1987, but a top federal regulator said Wednesday he sees better days ahead. The year-to-year drop in earnings was due entirely to large banks adding to reserves to cover anticipated losses on loans to Third World countries, said <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Although Sales Down Overall, Regional Picture Mixed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report that showed a slide in January new-home sales provided further evidence of a housing industry slump following the stock market crash five months ago. Last week the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> said sales of existing homes in January fell for the third straight month. Nevertheless, sales vary widely around the country, reflecting regional economies, interest rates and demand, random AP telephone queries of Realtors suggested. Here is a brief description of housing markets in six areas: <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>: Sales were stronger in the last three months of 1987 compared with a year earlier, and preliminary figures for early this year suggest stability. Fixed-rate mortgage rates have fallen slightly to about 9.75 percent, while prices are up more than 6 percent above year-earlier levels. <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>: Sales fell more than 30 percent in the last quarter of 1987 from the year earlier level. Prices have risen in a range of 2 percent to 8 percent. Fixed mortgage rates vary between 9 percent and 10 percent. <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>: Sales have fallen slightly but there is no clear-cut trend. Mortgage rates have fallen from 10.5 percent to about 9.5 percent and prices have risen nearly 10 percent from a year earlier. Southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>: Sales have fallen about 3.3 percent from a year earlier. Fixed rate mortgages are expected to fall to 9.5 percent from 9.75 percent. Prices have risen between 1 percent and 2 percent from a year earlier. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>: Sales have slowed, and recent drops in mortgage rates to the 10 percent level are expected to stimulate the market. Prices have remained about the same. <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>: Sales have improved since the start of the year and mortgage rates have declined slightly to about 9.5 percent. Prices have remained about the same.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Rules For Unions In Dues Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An evenly divided <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled Wednesday that an airlines may be forced to continue to collect union dues from workers after its contract with employees has expired. The justices, by a 4-4 vote, upheld rulings that forced <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> to continue the dues check-off after a strike by flight attendants in 1986. Such splits automatically uphold lower court rulings but set no national precedent. The <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> case carried little impact for most employers, anyway, because it involved an interpretation of the Railway Labor Act, which only applies to the airlines and railroad industries. Most private industry employers' labor relations are subject to the National Labor Relations Act. Nonetheless, <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> <PERSON> Frankovich </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attendants </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` We are extremely pleased with this result.'' The ruling was not accompanied by any written opinion or by any indication of how each individual justice voted. Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who only recently joined the court, did not participate in the case. <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> and the Independent Federation of Flight Attendants had a three-year contract that expired July 31, 1984. Prolonged negotiations followed but the union called a strike on March 7, 1986. The strike ended on May 17, 1986, when the flight attendants offered to return to work. Only some 200 attendants had stayed out for the entire strike. <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> hired 2,800 new attendants during the strike, and about 1,200 others either never joined the strike or returned to work during it. The airline then canceled the dues-checkoff provision of the old contract, meaning that it no longer would collect union dues. But a federal judge, upheld by the 8th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, ruled that the airline must honor the old contract's provisions The appeals court said the Railway Labor Act bars employers from unilaterally canceling union security and dues check-offs contract provisions. Any such changes must be made in negotiations between the employer and its workers, the appeals court said.

<HEAD>Sugarman Says He's Considering Proxy Fight For Media General Seat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Television producer <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> said Tuesday he is considering waging a proxy fight for one of three Class A seats on <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors as a next step in his effort to gain control of the company. `` It would be interesting to have a true outside director on the board,'' <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> said in an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Richmond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Dispatch </ORGANIZATION>, which is owned by Media General. `` I would look forward to serving on the board.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> vice president, said the company was prepared any proxy fight mounted by <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> controls 9.8 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION>'s 28 million shares of Class A common stock and has offered $ 61.50 per share for the remainder of the company's Class A and Class B stock, or a total of about $ 1.75 billion. The Class A shares rose $ 2.75 to $ 49 a share Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Media General has only 559,168 privately-held Class B shares outstanding, but they have the power to elect seven of the company's 10 directors. Holders of the publicly-traded Class A stock elected three directors at last year's annual meeting, while holders of the Class B stock elected six. About 71 percent of the Class B shares are owned by Chairman <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tennant </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> and Vice Chairman <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. The rest is owned by relatives and others closely associated with them and Media General. Any change in control of the company would require approval from two-thirds of the Class B holders. `` It's easy for lawyers to say you ca n't do something, but others would say the structure is n't fair or right,'' <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> said. `` The shareholders might revolt.'' <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> had asked Media General to respond to his buyout offer by Friday. Shortly after the offer came in, the <ORGANIZATION> Bryans </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement saying their shares `` are not for sale, for any price.'' <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> made his offer through two companies of which he is chairman: <ORGANIZATION> Barris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, which produces television game shows, and <ORGANIZATION> Giant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Harleyville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, which makes cement. Media General owns a number of daily newspapers, including the <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> -RRB- Times-Dispatch and News Leader, the <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> -RRB- Journal and the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>, plus 32 weeklies in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. It also has a 40 percent interest in <ORGANIZATION> Garden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the owner of 18 dailies and four weeklies in eight states.

<HEAD>Eastern Pilots Sue To Bar Orion Transfer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A pilots' union filed suit Wednesday to stop <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> from transferring aircraft to <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> in the latest legal move to block the transfer of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> assets by its parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s request for a temporary restraining order was made at federal court in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION>, a cargo carrier based in <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, has asked the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> for certification to fly 26 Eastern planes on <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> routes by April 1. `` I do n't think there is any question that this is a blatant union-busting attempt,'' <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said Tuesday. Eastern spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> declined to comment on the suit Wednesday. But a day earlier, company spokeswoman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON> said the airline had contracted with <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> `` to protect itself against <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION>'' in the event that its pilots refused to cross picket lines during a possible <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union strike. Eastern is in federal mediation on its contract with the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION>, the largest of its three unions. The unions earlier protested the spinoff of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> shuttle as a separate <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary and the airline's year-old call for $ 490 million in labor cuts The carrier lost $ 182 million in 1987 following a $ 131 million loss in 1986. Eastern cited those losses in firing 3,500 workers last November and another 600 in January. <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> charged there was evidence Miami-based Eastern may go through with the <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> transfer, which it said violates its contract, even if a strike is averted. Meanwhile, a group called the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Positive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> blasted Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mo </LOCATION>., for his criticism of Eastern management A letter dated March 1 and signed by 11 Eastern reservation agents and airport agents from across the country accused the presidential candidate of trying to `` achieve political gain at the expense of our company and jobs.'' During a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> visit last Friday, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> cared more about `` quick paper profits'' than its employees and that its management decisions reflect `` the dismantling of a great corporation.''
