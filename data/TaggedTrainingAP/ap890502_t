<HEAD>Study: Better Work Conditions Could Ease Nurse Shortage</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 High turnover among nurses is leaving hospitals short-handed, but better working conditions and higher pay should ease a national nursing shortage, researchers said Tuesday. `` Working conditions are more important than pay,'' said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Wyatt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a consulting firm that conducted a two-year national survey on nursing, called `` I Love My Work. I Hate My Job.'' Besides higher pay, nurses should have more influence on their jobs, fewer menial or non-medical tasks, more chances for advancement, and more scheduling flexibility where possible, the study says. A separate <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON> study issued in July showed that one in 10 hospital-nursing jobs is unfilled, and that one in five registered nurses leave their hospital employ every year, <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> said. `` There really is not a shortage of registered nurses in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Claudia </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON>, a consultant in <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> office The shortage is of those willing to work in hospitals, she said. `` Keeping nurses in hospital-based nursing is the key priority,'' Ms. <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON> said. For the two-year study, <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON> conducted interviews _ some lasting several hours _ with more than 500 people, including hospital administrators, nursing managers and more than 200 current or former nurses, Ms. <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON> said. The sample of people at 100 hospitals in 10 states was designed to be nationally representative, including nurses with a range of jobs from hospitals of all sizes, she said. Spokeswoman <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Towne </PERSON> of the Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nurses </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said the group's parent organization, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nurses </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, issued a set of similar solutions to the nursing shortage a year ago. Improved salary and benefits, better working conditions, and helping part-time nurses return to full employment were among the suggestions, she said. According to the <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON> study, the average staff salary for a registered nurse in August was $ 26,000, ranging from a low of $ 22,800 in the rural Southeast to a high of $ 30,400 in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> suburbs. The average starting annual salary for a newly graduated registered nurse was $ 22,300, ranging from a low of $ 20,400 in a rural hospital in the north-central region to a high of $ 25,500 in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> suburbs. The report noted that no relationship was found between salaries at facilities that perceive a nursing shortage and those that do not. Ms. <PERSON> Towne </PERSON> also said that an increasing demand for nurses, rather than nurses giving up hospital work, appeared to be creating the shortage in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, where 100,000 registered nurses work. She said nationwide, 2 million registered nurses are licensed, and 1.6 million _ the most ever _ are working. Of those, 65 percent to 68 percent work in hospitals, Ms. <PERSON> Towne </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON> said giving nurses more say in defining their jobs, and more options concerning shifts and part-time work can pay off for hospitals. `` Nurses are true white-collar professionals who love being in the front line of patient care,'' she said, `` but sometimes they feel they get treated like blue-collar workers.'' The survey was conducted at hospitals in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.

 The jail in this windswept provincial capital is empty, except for a rusting bicycle stored in one cell and potted plants in the other. `` There are crimes here, but only small crimes,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Clementi </PERSON> <PERSON> Cantor </PERSON>, chief of the two-man police force in <LOCATION> Basco </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Batanes </LOCATION>, the forgotten province of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. This year, Sgt. <PERSON> Cantor </PERSON> has investigated three `` crimes'' _ domestic disputes and fights between neighbors. None was serious enough for the courts. Only 23 crimes were reported in the entire province last year. The most serious, a murder committed by a soldier, was the first killing reported in 20 years. `` We've had judges come to hear cases and they say it's like a vacation in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Tess </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillejos </PERSON>, executive secretary to the mayor. The low crime rate is one of many features that make <LOCATION> Batanes </LOCATION>, the smallest, most northerly and least developed province, unique in the violence-plagued <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Its 15,000 people, known as Ivatans, live in quiet isolation. They fish and raise crops and cattle on 10 small islands about 250 miles -RRB- north of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> and only 140 miles south of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. Few outsiders venture to <LOCATION> Batanes </LOCATION>, whose lush green fields, mist-shrouded hills and villages on rocky cliffs make it look more like the Welsh coast than the tropics. Telephones? Forget it. The radio-telephone link was cut last year when communist rebels blew up a relay station on <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION>, the main Philippine island. <LOCATION> Batanes </LOCATION> is not perfect. It has the highest rate of alcohol consumption in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Per capita income is only 416 pesos -LRB- $ 19.80 -RRB- a month, so many of the brightest youngsters leave after high school in search of opportunity. `` We need government investments in cattle, fishing, garlic and root crops and to improve the seaport so our young people can find jobs here,'' said the provincial governor, <PERSON> Telesforo </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillejos </PERSON>. `` Most provinces have an overpopulation, problem but our growth has been almost nill because of emigration.'' Typhoons and and other storms batter the islands frequently and <PERSON> Ivatans </PERSON> live in square, fortress-like stone houses for protection from them, but there are no communist rebels, no armed gangs and no beggars. Internal combustion engines do not pollute the air in <LOCATION> Basco </LOCATION>, a town of 6,000 people. All <LOCATION> Batanes </LOCATION> has only 120 motor vehicles and two-thirds are motorcycles. If roosters crowing can be called noise pollution, it is the most common form. Lt. Col. <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Poblete </PERSON>, provincial military commander, said `` I do n't feel very busy here.'' His major challenge is the occasional Taiwanese fishing vessel encroaching on Philippine waters. Otherwise, he said, `` All we do is run, train and have meetings. I do n't have much to do.'' `` I think it's the perpetual serenity which we do n't find in the metropolitan areas that keeps people here,'' said <PERSON> Tess </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillejos </PERSON>, an in-law of the governor and native of <LOCATION> Batanes </LOCATION> who returned with her husband after several years in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. `` In <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, I spent the whole day taking my children to and from school and driving to stores. Here, I kiss them in the morning and they come home in the afternoon. I can walk everywhere.'' Because of frequent storms in the Balintang Channel, commercial ships do not run regular services between <LOCATION> Batanes </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION>, 140 miles to the south. Most supplies come on LST landing craft, which the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> navy uses extensively for inter-island traffic. They reach <LOCATION> Batanes </LOCATION> about every three months. One ran aground in the harbor during a storm last year and its hulk is still there, quietly rusting. <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> provides the main link with the world, a daily flight often canceled because of bad weather. A siren heralds the plane's arrival and scores of townspeople usually go to meet it, since the airport is within walking distance of downtown Basco. There is no television and residents can pick up Philippine state radio for only a few hours a day on a relay from <LOCATION> Tuguegarao </LOCATION>, 200 miles south. That hardly matters because only a few hundred homes in Basco can receive the part-time electricity. When the juice comes on for four hours each evening, residents flock to makeshift theaters where local entrepreneurs show movies at 5 pesos -LRB- 25 cents -RRB- a head. Those who have seen the available movies watch or participate in pickup basketball games in the town square until the electricity goes off. `` Fishing, swimming, biking, that's about all the recreation here,'' said <PERSON> Aniano </PERSON> <PERSON> Bata </PERSON>, 45, a lifelong resident. `` It's good, clean fun.''

<TEXT>
 The nation's largest school system with nearly 1 million students has been beset by reports of drug abuse, theft and sexual misconduct by teachers, principals and school board officials. New Yorkers will have their first opportunity to render an electoral verdict on the scandals in today's elections for new community school board members, but few expected a large turnout. And no one even knows if the results of the election will stand up. A federal judge last week struck down a new law prohibiting school employees, political office holders and party officials from sitting on the boards, but challenges were expected. `` All of this is making the voters feel somewhat powerless,'' said state <PERSON> Assemblyman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>. The city's 32 school boards were set up two decades ago when the city's school system was decentralized to help parents and communities get a handle on their neighborhood schools. The local boards operate 800 elementary and intermediate schools. Each board hires its schools' principals, assistant principals and district administrators and is responsible for educating about 20,000 children from kindergarten through grades 8 or 9. The school system also maintains a bureaucracy of employees who work in the <ORGANIZATION> central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> headquarters. The central board operates the city's 115 senior high schools, negotiates citywide contracts, maintains the system's 900 schools, sets citywide policy and, in theory, oversees the community boards. But in the last few months, five school board officials in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> have been indicted on felony charges ranging from theft to bribe taking. Outraged over alleged criminality and proved mismanagement, schools Chancellor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> has suspended two <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> school boards. There also have been reports that principals and other administrators obtained their positions by paying bribes to school board members. `` The notion that you become a principal not on the merits, but on the basis of how much money you got in your pocket, to me, is just mind boggling and it's outrageous. It just makes my blood boil,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gill </PERSON>, a lawyer and former prosecutor heading a city commission charged with investigating the allegations of wrongdoing. At one school meeting in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, women publicly confronted a school official with allegations he had offered to trade jobs for sex. Recent newspaper articles have told of booze-and-drug parties on school property, graft and corruption. The scandals broke last November when a principal at a <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> elementary school was arrested on drug charges. That was followed by arrests of several teachers on similar charges. Criminal inquiries of some boards are under way in the boroughs of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>; only <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> has escaped. Educators, analysts and teacher union officials agree that the wrongdoing at the root of the scandals has had an affect on the performance of many schools. `` When people are misusing funds, then it takes away resources from the educational program. It directly affects what goes on in the schools,'' said <PERSON> Thurston </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON>, a longtime observer of decentralization and a professor at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. A <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> teacher who who asked not to be identified put it more succinctly: `` It kills morale when you have to worry ` Am I going to have enough chalk, enough of this, enough of that.''' The school system's decentralization was a product of the turbulent 1960s, a lengthy citywide teachers' strike and pressure from militant civil-rights activists. The reform divided up the system to give local residents, particularly parents, a greater voice in the operation of the schools. But with a disturbingly low voter turnout of 5 percent not uncommon in school elections, some boards are dominated not by parents but by political hacks who allegedly dole out jobs to supporters, friends, relatives and sometimes applicants willing to put cash in the right pockets. <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Litlow </PERSON>, executive director of Interface, a research organization concerned with education, has studied the schools for a dozen years and blames voter apathy on the timing of the elections _ which are not held on regular election days but in the spring of every third year _ and the little media attention they generally get. `` The confused structure'' of the school system also promotes low turnout, he said.

<HEAD>Study: Elementary School Pupils Watch Their Waistlines</HEAD>

 Children, like adults, may be keenly conscious of their waistlines and many have tried dieting, a hospital survey suggests. Nearly half of 318 elementary school children surveyed worried they were overweight, and more than a third said they had attempted diets, according to a study released Monday. `` This study tells us that it's not just the 15 -, 20 - or 40-year-olds who feel they're overweight _ 9 - and 10-year-olds feel the same way,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON>, director of psychiatry and psychology at <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> The study, `` A Survey of Dieting Behavior and Eating Attitudes in Children,'' will be published in September's issue of Pediatrics, a monthly professional journal. Researchers at the hospital surveyed girls and boys in the third through sixth grades at two randomly hosen schools in middle-income Cincinnati-area neighborhoods. Of those surveyed, the researchers said 45 percent indicated they were uncomfortable with their bodies and wanted to be thinner. Thirty-seven percent said they had already tried to lose weight, <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> said. `` Girls in grades five and six reported significantly more discomfort about their bodies than girls in grades three and four or boys in all grades,'' he said. A total of 6.9 percent gave responses similar to those obtained in studies of teen-agers and young adult females who suffer from anorexia nervosa, a condition characterized by severe and prolonged inability or refusal to eat, he said. `` Previous research has determined that 70 percent of 17-year-old girls think they're overweight, but only 20 to 30 percent really are,'' he said. The researchers plan a six-year followup study in hopes of learning more about the possible causes of eating disorders and ways to treat them. <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> planned to present his findings Thursday to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pediatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

 Twenty tons of rocket fuel burst into flame Monday in a munitions igloo, sending a cloud of smoke and fumes 1,000 feet into the air, officials said. There were no injuries. The blaze burned part of the domed storage area and scorched a 2,000-square-foot area of adjacent grass before being put out 1 -LCB- hours after it started, said <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Sgt. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Arana-Barradas </PERSON> Lt. Col. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Rianda </PERSON> said there was no explosion, but said the Minuteman I missile propellant burned rapidly at this base about 20 miles north of <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. There was no damage estimate, but <PERSON> Arana-Barradas </PERSON> said the igloo was `` built to withstand this kind of stuff.'' The cloud of smoke and fumes which rose 1,000 feet above the igloo drifted south over the base and dispersed into the atmosphere, base officials said in a statement. Taking into account the possibility that someone might have come into contact with remants of the cloud, base environmental officials cautioned that the type of fire involved normally produces large amounts of hydrogen chloride gas, which could irritate the nose, throat and lungs, the statement said. An investigation into the fire was not expected to begin until noon Tuesday, because of a mandatory waiting period to allow the igloo to cool off before <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> munitions crews can enter, <PERSON> Arana-Barradas </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>'s Law caught up with the <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> bed when a federal appeals court ruled that the name of the famous fold-down bed is now so commonly used that it's no longer protected by trademark laws. `` We hold that ` <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> bed' is a generic term, having been appropriated by the public to designate generally a type of bed,'' the 2nd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> said Monday in overturning part of a lower court ruling. The 2nd Circuit ruled that a federal judge on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> erred in finding companies in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> _ both named <ORGANIZATION> Murphy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> _ had infringed on the trademark rights of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Murphy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Door </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which was founded in 1925 by the inventor of the disappearing bed. But like <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>'s Law, in which anything that can go wrong will, the appeals court also had some bad news for the <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> bed imitators: `` We agree with the district court that defendants engaged in unfair competition by passing off beds of their own manufacture as beds of the <ORGANIZATION> Murphy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>,'' which is based in <LOCATION> Amittyville </LOCATION>. The court also affirmed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Mishler </PERSON>'s injunction, which bars the two companies from using the term `` <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> bed. At the turn of the century, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> invented a bed that could be concealed in a wall closet when not in use. He patented the idea in 1918. At least twice, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> successfully convinced imitators who marketed their products as <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> beds to use a different name. But the appeals court noted that in 1981 and in 1982, the federal Patent and <ORGANIZATION> Trademark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> refused the <ORGANIZATION> Murphy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s bid to register `` <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> bed'' as a trademark, and a trademark appeals board found in 1984 that `` <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> bed has for a long period of time been used by a substantial segment of the public as a generic term for a bed which folds into a wall or closet.'' While affirming the $ 6,330 in damages awarded The <ORGANIZATION> Murphy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Door </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for breach of contract, the appeals court dismissed the $ 801,161 awarded in compensatory damages and sent the case back to <PERSON> Mishler </PERSON> for a recalculation based on the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> companies' net profits. Court papers did not specify in which cities the companies are based.

 In its final days, this country's election campaign is getting nasty even by <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s rough-and-tumble Stumping opposition candidates for the presidency and other national and local posts call government leaders treacherous slime, thugs and thieves. The eight-party pro-government coalition counters with a television ad featuring President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> speaking with a bogus voice-over in English with Spanish subtitles. The voice-over, picking up on a published report, has <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> admitting he authorized $ 10 million to subsidize opposition parties, although the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration has not commented on the report. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> contends forces loyal to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s de facto leader, Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, intend to rig Sunday's election. Billboards proclaiming the charms of opposition presidential candidate <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> have had large American flag decals pasted on them with the slogan, `` For $ 10 million, he sold out his country.'' Much of the vilification has been undertaken in the name of two dead men _ Gen. <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON>, the charismatic dictator who died in a plane crash in 1981; and <ORGANIZATION> Arnulfo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arias </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Madrid </ORGANIZATION>, the grand old man of the Panamanian opposition. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> was thrown out of the presidency three times by coups and died last year at age 87. Both men had large, almost fantaical cult-like personal followings, something both <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> and pro-government candidate <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Duque </PERSON> lack. Even some of <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>'s posters carry pictures not of him, but of <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>. <PERSON> Duque </PERSON>'s ads rarely mention his name without invoking the memory of <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON>, the prime mover in getting the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to agree to turn the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> over to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> at the end of the century.

 Despite the negative tone of the campaign, there is a refreshing lightness to some of it. Latin jazz bands packed into pickups drive around displaying flags and decals from any of the 11 parties fielding candidates. Campaign songs blare from trucks that stop in the middle of busy intersections, play their message to a grid-locked audience, then drive off. A mish mash of colorful campaign posters covers just about everything that does n't move and many things that do. In one of the city's wealthier neighborhoods, a man patiently peeled 50 Christian Democrat posters off a wall around his house. Two hours later, the wall was covered again with posters from another party. It was hopeless.

 His catch gave him quite a battle, but a fisherman known as `` Salmon Bill'' landed the season's first salmon on <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Penobscot </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, earning him the right to offer his prize to the president. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON>, 41, who lives in a tent near the river during the May-mid-October season, caught the 25 -LCB- - inch, 6-pound fish early Monday `` This fish took me out in the middle of the river three or four times.

But she finally came in,'' said <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON>, who was among about 100 anglers in the <LOCATION> Penobscot </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Bangor </LOCATION> for the opening of season. Within hours, the fish had been certified as a sea-run salmon and up to standards for delivery to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, in keeping with tradition. <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Department officials were making arrangements for a presentation later this month to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who is a fishing enthusiast, said department spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Fournier </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON>'s offer continues a tradition that started in 1912 when a sea-run salmon was presented to President <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 A wolf that ran wild in a residential area and ate a pet rabbit belongs to actor <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, but the `` Flash Gordon'' star wo n't be getting his pet back, authorities said. `` We believe he purchased it as a pup from a breeder so it was raised in a sort of domestic environment. But still, you ca n't have them,'' Lt. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> of the city's <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulation </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. The 100-pound wolf, a full-grown female named Hurricane, was captured April 14 near the <LOCATION> Encino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reservoir </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. Residents of the hillside neighborhood had complained that a huge white dog had been roaming the area for about two months and gobbled down a rabbit. <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> said the predator is probably an endangered gray wolf. Its nearest wild relatives are in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. In addition to starring in the 1980 movie `` Flash <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> appeared in `` 10'' and in the television series `` <PERSON> Hardcastle </PERSON> and <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON>,'' `` Hunter'' and `` Highwaymen.'' His personal manager, <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamens </PERSON>, said he had no knowledge of the matter and would not comment. Keeping wolves within city limits without a permit is a misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in jail and a fine of up to $ 500, said Lt. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> of the animal regulation department. But he said there were no immediate plans to prosecute <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. Hurricane apparently lived by hunting wild rabbits, ground squirrels, opossums and quail in the uninhabited brush around the reservoir, officials said. `` We want to give the wolf to some type of a sanctuary that can handle that type of animal. We just do n't want to send it anywhere,'' <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> said. `` She's not going back to the owner.''

 Gen. <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, who ousted <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> and his 34-year dictatorship three months ago, routed seven other candidates in presidential elections Monday, unofficial returns showed. Opposition candidates denounced `` numerous and serious'' irregularities in the balloting, but by late Monday evening had not withdrawn from the election or challenged the early results. One opponent conceded. `` We promise our people we will carry <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> on a bright path to its destiny of greatness and happiness,'' <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> told cheering party members at his home Monday night as he lifted a glass of champagne in a toast. Official returns had not been disclosed nearly eight hours after polls closed but unofficial tallies by <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>' ruling <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> as well as by the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> and the political science group <ORGANIZATION> CEPES </ORGANIZATION> showed the general won by an overwhelming majority. <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Laino </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Authentic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the presidents of three other opposition parties denounced `` serious deficiencies'' in the balloting. They refused to concede, but did not withdraw. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Colorados </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> received 576,312 votes of 772,785 cast for president, or 74.5 percent. The closest challenger, <PERSON> Laino </PERSON>, garnered 158,851 votes or 19.94 percent. The votes represented nearly more than a third of the 2.2 million people on official voter registration lists. Non-Colorado candidates have complained that the list was out of date and bloated, and even the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said the list might contain 600,000 duplicate or non-existent names. The <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, one of eight parties that submitted slates of candidates for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said it garnered 552,542 votes for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> out of 743,150 votes cast, or 74.4 percent. It said <PERSON> Laino </PERSON>'s party received 148,202, or 19.9 percent. The Colorados would thus, by law, receive 24 of the 36 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seats and 48 spots in the 72-seat Chamber of Deputies. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, 65, an army general and longtime aide to <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, dissolved <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> after leading the Feb. 3 coup that ended nearly 35 years of <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> rule. He served as provisional president since then. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> also belonged to the party, which has been in power since 1947. Turnout appeared high across this landlocked South American nation of 4 million, despite cloudy skies, light rain and cool fall weather. Diplomats and foreign observers said the balloting and vote count were reasonably fair and <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> clearly won. `` I think it was a very good attempt at something they have never done before,'' said British Ambassador <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>. Presidential candidate <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferreira </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibarra </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> acknowledged that <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> won. <PERSON> Laino </PERSON>, a former exile, said earlier Monday that the voting irregularities were `` numerous and serious. We do not have all the information, but the irregularities exceeded our expectations.'' Election observers and party officials said not every citizen was able to vote in private; ballots of opposition parties were stolen and so not available at election tables; indelible ink was not always used to prevent multiple voting, and the government added voters to the official list after the registration period ended three weeks ago. <PERSON> Euclides </PERSON> <PERSON> Acevedo </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Febrerista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said ballots for his party were stolen at several voting stations by <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> supporters `` who simply put them in their pockets.'' But <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Vera </PERSON>, the party's presidential nominee, said the four opposition parties were not about to withdraw from the election. `` Why the obsession about withdrawing?'' <PERSON> Vera </PERSON> asked a reporter. `` No one has to withdraw from the process. ... What must be done is determine on the basis of results if the fraud ... was significant in its entirety or not.'' Government and <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials denied irregularities were widespread, organized by them or influenced the outcome. Paraguayans seemed to accept as unavoidable one more general in the National Palace and the <ORGANIZATION> Colorados </ORGANIZATION> once more in control of congress, given the suddenness of elections following a long dictatorship. `` My party was founded in 1965. This is the first time we're participating in elections,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Caceres </PERSON>, 28, a Christian Democrat `` People are hopeful,'' he said, standing in a school courtyard. `` The period of <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> has n't ended ... but this is a beneficial transition _ peaceful, with people getting used to democracy.'' In <PERSON> Coronel </PERSON> <PERSON> Oviedo </PERSON>, a large rural town 80 miles east of the capital city of <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION>, peasants traveled along muddy roads to voting stations by flatbed truck, horse, bicycle and tractor. `` The last time I voted was in <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s second re-election,'' in the late 1960s, said <PERSON> Dario </PERSON> <PERSON> Benitez </PERSON>, 60. `` Then I quit because I did n't like him anymore.'' Since becoming provisional president, <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> has criticized the former regime, permitted banned newspapers and political parties to operate and mended fences with foreign governments and the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. Prominent <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> aides and ministers have been arrested. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, 76, lives in exile in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>.

 He's a federal bureaucrat by day, an opera singer by night and soon to be making his debut in a Broadway-style musical. `` I understand how <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> feels,'' says <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Ekzarkhov </PERSON>. After he leaves his 8 to 5 job as a mild-mannered government financial analyst, <PERSON> Ekzarkhov </PERSON> ducks into a dressing room and emerges as a theatrical version of Superman, playing dual roles as a <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> dockhand and a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> cop in Arena Stage's recreation of `` On the Town.'' The hit 1944 musical created by the best in show business _ music by <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>, book and lyrics by <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Comden </PERSON> and <PERSON> Adolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, and choreography by <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> _ is the story of three sailors on 24-hour shore leave in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> during World War II. The Arena Stage production, which opens Thursday and will run through June 4, will be the first major revival of `` On the Town'' since 1971, at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s City Center, and the first ever presented at a theater in the round. This production was underwritten by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. Arena Stage has no orchestra pit, so musical director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Huckaby </PERSON> installed his 18 musicians under the stage and will conduct while peeking up at the actors and dancers through a manhole in the floor. <PERSON> Ekzarkhov </PERSON> shows off his booming bass voice in the opening number, `` I Feel Like I'm Not Out of Bed Yet,'' as a workman at the <ORGANIZATION> Brooklyn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yard </ORGANIZATION>. At 6 feet 3 inches and 235 pounds, he's physically right for the part `` It's a wonderful piece,'' he says. `` The only bone I have to pick with <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> is that he did n't write at least 10 more pages.'' <PERSON> Ekzarkhov </PERSON>, 42, is the son of Russian emigres who fled their homeland after the 1917 revolution and met in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, where they were married and <PERSON> Ekzarkhov </PERSON> was born. He was 5 when he and his parents moved to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and settled in <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, home of a large Russian and Polish community. `` It was a comfortable place to grow up in,'' said <PERSON> Ekzarkhov </PERSON>. A high school pal was <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Biletnikoff </PERSON>, who later earned fame as a star pass receiver for the <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Raiders </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ekzarkhov </PERSON> learned to sing in the local Russian Orthodox church choir under the direction of his steelworker father. `` They really like their basses to sing very low,'' he said. He met his wife, <PERSON> Dusia </PERSON>, the daughter of Soviet emigres, at a New Year's Eve party in 1969 in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> while he was on shore leave from the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. They still prefer to speak Russian at home after nearly 20 years of marriage. The couple and their two young children spent 2 -LCB- satisfying years in the central <LOCATION> Volga </LOCATION> region of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Ekzarkhov </PERSON> was office manager for an <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> chemical plant, then returned to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and its Russian-speaking community for good. `` It was an incredible experience,'' <PERSON> Ekzarkhov </PERSON> recalls. `` The people there looked exactly like the people I grew up with in Erie. In a way, we came home. Yet as Americans, we could n't help noticing that our point of reference was <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' With a family to support and a mortgage to pay, <PERSON> Ekzarkhov </PERSON> took a job at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, where he specializes in gas transmission rate cases. `` I'm not knocking my job,'' he says, `` but it's not what I want on my tombstone.'' <PERSON> Ekzarkhov </PERSON> discovered his true passion _ singing _ when he landed a job in the chorus of a local amateur opera production of <PERSON> Verdi </PERSON>'s `` Aida'' 10 years ago Encouraged by friends, voice teachers and auditioners, including Soviet-born conductor <PERSON> Mstislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostropovich </PERSON>, he has sung with the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION>, the Summer Opera Theater at <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, the Opera Orchestra of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canto </LOCATION> and local oratorio societies. `` I'm right up against reality now,'' <PERSON> Ekzarkhov </PERSON> adds. `` I'm at the point where I need an agent. You ca n't do anything in opera without an agent. I guess I never followed through because it would mean living out of a suitcase at very reduced pay.'' He's clearly ready to take the plunge, though, whenever his persistent round of recitals, choral work, stage appearances and auditions finally pays off, either in opera or musical comedy. `` I've spent many lonely hours singing at the piano,'' says <PERSON> Ekzarkhov </PERSON>. `` I keep saying to myself, ` What am I doing here? Who am I kidding?' `` But then there's the ecstasy of being on stage and performing at this level. What's important is that the audience have this look on their faces. If you can get the audience to get a little wet in the eyes, you've gotten them. That's it!''

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vowed `` read my lips: no new taxes'' all through his presidential campaign but never indicated for how long the message would be displayed there. Administration officials now are reluctantly conceding that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> may only stick to the pledge for a year, and that higher taxes may be part of a fiscal 1991 budget agreement. One possibility actively being considered is a swap trading <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> support for some new taxes, most likely on gasoline, for concessions from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in other areas, like a cut in the capital gains tax rate, said the sources, speaking on the condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has long made chopping the capital gains tax rate a key item, claiming it will eventually raise revenue for the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>. But it has found scant support in the Democratic controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which questions the logic of trying to raise revenue by cutting taxes. Despite <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s rhetoric against new taxes, reiterated as recently as Monday in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, many economists say higher taxes seem all but inevitable to get the federal deficit _ estimated at $ 163 billion this year _ under control. In fact, to many analysts, it was only a matter of time before the administration conceded that some forms of tax hikes were needed. Administration officials still have n't done this publicly. But privately they admit contingency planning is under way on new taxes _ and on what tradeoffs the administration might be able to wrest from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in exchange for White House support for them. Even the no-new-taxes budget compromise <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> recently reached with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for fiscal year 1990 calls for $ 5.3 billion in unspecified new revenues. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has claimed that slashing the capital gains tax from the present 28 percent to 15 percent will produce the bulk of this, $ 4.8 billion. But since <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> seems unlikely to go along with this tax cut, some way must still be found this year to come up with the $ 5.3 billion. And, a weakening economy could make the projected 1990 deficit even larger than the $ 98.6 billion <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> projected in his budget submission to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ meaning even more `` new revenues'' will be needed to meet deficit targets of the Gramm-Rudman law. That budget-balancing act requires a deficit of no more than $ 100 billion in fiscal 1990 _ or automatic across-the-board cuts are triggered. Budget Director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> will issue revised economic assumptions on the economy on July 15. Some administration sources suggested that a gas-tax-for-capital-gains-cut deal might even be considered as early as then, if the new economic numbers prove to be gloomy. But generally, administration officials said the president's clear intention was to honor his campaign vow through this year After that, all bets are off. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Monday showed no indication he was ready to make a deal, however. In his speech to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, he said: `` I mean to live by what I've said: No new taxes.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, `` We do n't have to raise taxes. We have to release the energies of free enterprise.'' He said his `` favorite source of new revenue'' was the capital gains tax cut. White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Monday, `` We are talking to the tax-writing committees about it -LRB- the capital gains tax cut -RRB-. But we would n't want to speculate on how it might come out at this time.'' The notion of a deal trading support for higher gasoline taxes for a cut in the capital gains tax was first raised the weekend before last in a session between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and a group of economists at the presidential retreat in Camp David, Md. Although <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was generally noncommittal, he did not object to discussing possible higher taxes, and the proposed swap was endorsed by some of the economists present, according to the sources. The federal gasoline tax is now 9.1 cents per gallon. There have been a variety of congressional proposals for raising the gasoline tax for amounts ranging from a few cents up to 50 cents a gallon. However, a major obstacle to any such rise is the opposition of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Administration Delays Enforcing Health Insurance Test</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is delaying the deadline for employers to begin using complex tests to prove that their health insurance plans do not discriminate against lower-paid workers. The testing requirement, enacted at the request of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration as part of the 1986 tax overhaul, imposes an unreasonable compliance burden on business, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said. He chose a meeting of business executives at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> on Monday to announce, `` We have ordered a delay until Oct. 1 in the beginning date for ... testing plans for compliance with -LRB- Internal Revenue Code -RRB- Section 89 regulations.'' The audience, which has made repeal or modification of the law a major goal, applauded loudly. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said the goal of the legislation _ to ensure that tax-deductible fringe benefits are distributed equitably among workers _ was a good one. `` A system that differentiates between people in the matter of health benefits subsidized by the taxpayers can not be sustained,'' he said. Nevertheless, the cost of compliance is excessive, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said. `` The law needs to be changed and we stand ready to encourage, support and work with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to revise and improve it.'' More than half the members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and a large number of senators are sponsoring bills to repeal the provision or change it significantly. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, whose chairman and most of its members are sponsoring one modification bill, was holding hearings on the subject today. The law requires employers to conduct a lengthy series of complex tests to demonstrate that employee benefits, especially health insurance, are not weighted against workers making less than $ 50,000 a year. Paperwork required by the law is so voluminous that some employers are threatening to withdraw health insurance coverage for all employees. The Section 89 rules went into effect on Jan. 1, but the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> freed employers from any significant compliance requirements until July 1 and agreed that no employer would be penalized if a good-faith effort to follow the rules was made the remainder of 1989. The federal government forgoes more than $ 30 billion a year in taxes on the value of employer-financed health insurance. The employer deducts the cost as a business expense and the employee excludes the value from taxable income. Under the Section 89 law, highly compensated employees may be subject to taxation on the excess coverage if their health plan is more valuable than is offered to rank-and-file workers. Under the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> substitute plan, employers that provide a health plan would have to offer coverage costing workers $ 10 a week or less -LRB- $ 25 or less for a family plan -RRB- to 90 percent of employees. Higher-paid workers would be taxed on the value of coverage that was better than that provided other employees.

<HEAD>Women's Rights Groups Hail Supreme Court Workplace Ruling</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Women's rights advocates are hailing a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling they say will lower a `` Catch 22'' barrier to advancement in the workplace. Women often have had be assertive to win promotion, they say, but at the same time not offend employers by sacrificing femininity. They said Monday's ruling is an important step in limiting the impact of such sexual stereotyping. The court said employers must bear the burden of proving they did not discriminate illegally once there is evidence bias played a part in personnel decisions. <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> said the ruling is an important victory for women's rights. `` In these situations there is substantial doubt who is going to win,'' she said. `` Now that we're going to see a shift in the focus, it's sufficient for a plaintiff to win.'' Ms. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> said the decision will help overcome a dual standard she labeled a Catch 22 that has held women back. `` It's been that you had to have the attributes of an assertive manager but also all the attributes of a passive, feminine non-assertive woman,'' she said. By a 6-3 vote, the justices ordered further lower court hearings in a suit against the accounting firm <ORGANIZATION> Price </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Waterhouse </ORGANIZATION> by a former employee, <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> said she was denied partnership because of `` macho'' attitudes that, in effect, demanded she behave more like a lady. The firm said other factors _ such as her failure to get along with others _ were decisive. Monday's decision may leave some questions unanswered because only four justices agreed on the standards that should govern such `` mixed-motive'' discrimination cases. There were three separate opinions by the six justices in the majority. `` This may not clarify things because of the split decision,'' said <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> McDowell </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Equal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> that sided with Price Waterhouse. But <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> of the Women's Legal Defense Fund said, `` Although this is not a complete victory, we consider it to be in the win category. We are gratified that the court said that once a woman proves gender was a factor, the burden shifts to the employer.'' Price Waterhouse, in a statement, said it expects to win against Ms. <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> when the suit returns to federal trial court. `` We are confident that after the lower court reconsiders the case, it will conclude ... Ms. <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> was denied partnership for legitimate reasons,'' the company said. Ms. <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> is seeking back pay and possibly reinstatement to the firm with promotion to partnership. The high court rejected a federal appeals court's requirement that Price Waterhouse show clear and convincing evidence its actions were unbiased. It is enough that the company show by a preponderance of the evidence it did not practice illegal discrimination, the court said. The clear and convincing standard usually means that to successfully defend against a lawsuit, an employer must show overwhelming evidence in its favor. By contrast, a preponderance standard means an employer wins by showing more evidence than not is on its side. The ruling is based on an interpretation of Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, banning discrimination based on race, religion and national origin as well as gender. Ms. <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>, formerly a senior manager for Price Waterhouse here, quit the firm after she was denied partnership and later became a consultant to the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. While she was under consideration for the promotion at the accounting firm, critics and supporters said she sometimes was overly aggressive, too harsh, impatient with her staff and very demanding. She said one partner who supported her for promotion told her she would stand a better chance of advancement if she would `` walk more femininely, talk more femininely, dress more femininely, wear make-up, have her hair styled and wear jewelry.'' In other action, the court: _ Agreed to consider blocking the partial merger of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s two daily newspapers The court will hear a challenge to former Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s decision allowing a joint operating agreement of the newspapers. _ Ruled unanimously that additional environmental-impact studies are not required before building a ski resort in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state and completing a dam in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> _ Agreed to use a case involving the <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> to restudy what limits should be placed on campaign spending by political groups that incorporate _ Agreed to hear, in an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> case, a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration appeal aimed at allowing the government to collect potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes from multinational corporations _ Ruled, 5-4 in a case from <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, that lawyers may not be forced by federal law to represent poor people in non-criminal federal cases

 One of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s most experienced <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> hands is in line to become ambassador to the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as part of an administration effort to revitalize that institution, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is expected to appoint <PERSON> Luigi </PERSON> <PERSON> Einaudi </PERSON>, 52, a right-hand man to the last six assistant secretaries of state for inter-American affairs, to the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> post, succeeding former Ambassador <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON>. The officials who confirmed <PERSON> Einaudi </PERSON>'s prospective appointment asked not to be identified One of a handful of intellectuals at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Einaudi </PERSON> has a doctorate in political science from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> and is a recipient of the highest award in the career public service. He was once called by former Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> `` the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s leading expert on U.S.-Latin American relations.'' Because of budgetary constraints partly brought on by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> failure to meet its quota commitments, the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> has been forced to negotiate early retirement for about 300 of its estimated 1,000 employees over the past several weeks. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has promised to seek full funding for the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> in 1990 and is showing support in other ways. As an example, Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> had a private meeting recently with <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Baena </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON>. Officials said they could not recall <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> ever having had such a meeting during his seven years as secretary of state. The administration also has been looking to the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> to play an active role in monitoring the political process under way in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> that is scheduled to result in national elections next February. A generation ago, the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> was at the center of political debate in the hemisphere. It imposed mandatory economic and diplomatic sanctions against <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> in 1964 for attempting to promote revolution in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. It also was deeply involved in the diplomatic process that followed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invasion of the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> the following year. However, the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> has been at the periphery of events for much of this decade, playing little or no role in such issues as the Malvinas-Falklands War of 1982, the <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> invasion of 1983 and the conflicts in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> envisions a stronger role for the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> under <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as part of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shift in emphasis toward multi-lateral diplomacy.

<TEXT>
 A group of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> investors in a gas well that yielded huge profits for <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> defend their dealings as legitimate and say the report of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee's outside counsel is misleading. The investors, who have been subpoenaed to testify Wednesday before the panel, issued a report on Monday through their <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer, <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brand </ORGANIZATION>, attacking committee counsel <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>'s report shows a `` lack of basic understanding of the oil industry and the actual facts of this venture,'' said the report, which the group said it was issuing to `` set the record straight.'' `` Rather than acting as an impartial investigator, Mr. <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> has displayed prosecutorial zeal without regard to innocent third parties who may stand in his way,'' the report said. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and his defenders have taken to attacking <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> as part of their strategy to counter the 69 counts of rules violations lodged by the ethics committee. Brand was hired to represent the gas well investors at the suggestion of former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, a Wright ally. The group argued that a geological formation struck by the well continues to be promising even though it so far has been unable to produce commercial quantities of gas or oil, and two earlier wells have been shut down. The report states that <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>, in characterizing the lucrative sale of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s share in the venture as a gift, has shown `` a fundamental misunderstanding of the oil business,'' because the share had a high value. The remaining partners in the venture plan to spend another $ 2 million to drill again because they estimate there remains some $ 88 million in recoverable oil and gas in their leased tract near the <LOCATION> Louisiana-Texas </LOCATION> line, according to the report. Brand said the group, which includes <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> financier <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON> and his son, M.D. -LRB- <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON>, has not yet decided whether to honor the ethics committee's subpoena calling for them to testify on Wednesday and Thursday. Also subpoenaed are <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, who has a working interest in the venture and supplied the drilling equipment, <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Prestridge </PERSON>, a geologist who consulted on <LOCATION> Sabine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> for the group and <PERSON> Marlyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Cherry </PERSON>, a bookkeeper for the <ORGANIZATION> Jaffes </ORGANIZATION>. The five had been subpoenaed for interviews last week, but failed to show up when the ethics committee's two senior members, chairman <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Calif., and ranking Republican <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, traveled to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> to speak with them The committee later reiterated its subpoenas and ordered the five to appear on Wednesday and Thursday of this week.

<HEAD>Intrest Rates Highest in Three Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Over the next six months, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> savings bonds will be earning the highest rate of return in three years, the government says. The new rate, which took effect Monday, will be 7.81 percent, up from the rate of 7.35 percent that had been in effect over the past six months. The new rate is the highest return for savers since the bonds earned 8.36 percent for the sx-month period ending in April 1986. Interest on savings bonds is adjusted twice a year on May 1 and Nov. 1 to reflect open market rates. The rate is based on 85 percent of the yield on five-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities, which have averaged 9.19 percent over the past six months. Since the government switched to market rates for savings bonds in November 1982, the rate of return has averaged 8.29 percent. Investors who hold their bonds for at least five years earn the average of the half-year rtes. <PERSON> Jerrold </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Speers </PERSON>, executive director of the savings bond program, called the new rate `` terrific news for savers.'' `` When looked at in combination of the other benefits of bonds _ including tax advantages, complete safety against loss, ease of purchase _ it is clear that this new rate makes savings bonds an unbeatable deal,'' <PERSON> Speers </PERSON> said. Investors are guaranteed a minimum interest rate, regardless of what the market rates do. That minimum guaranteed rate is currently 6 percent. But for bonds purchased before Nov. 1, 1986, the minimum is 7.5 percent. Since market rates for bonds were introduced, the rates have ranged from a high of 10.94 percent for the six months beginning in November 1984 to a low of 5.84 percent for the six months beginning in May 1987.

<HEAD>Panel Focuses on Use of US-Banned Pesticides on Imported Fruit</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee this week will be examining whether Americans are getting imported produce sprayed with U.S.-made pesticides that are outlawed for use here. Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., who chairs the subcommittee on environment, energy and natural resources, said he is concerned the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> is n't adequately informing other countries about the chemicals they're buying from American companies to enhance crop production `` Many of these countries do not have the resources or information needed to ensure that pesticides are used safely,'' said <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>. He said they need help developing regulations and they need information. `` They're not getting enough of either,'' he said. <PERSON> Synar </PERSON> noted that pesticide exports have increased and so have foreign food imports. He said his subcommittee, which will hold a hearing on the issue Wednesday, will review <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts to protect <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> consumers from imported food contaminated by pesticides which are prohibited from use domestically. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Vroom </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemicals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said some of the pesticides that are exported are unregistered here because they are designed to combat insects that exist only in the climate of the foreign country. But he said it is in the best interests of the industry to have as much information available to buyers as possible. `` We support access to information, delivery of information and delivery of educational packages that do some good, not just arrive on a dock somewhere,'' said <PERSON> Vroom </PERSON>. He said his organization has conducted educational programs on pesticide use for foreign buyers. Through the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, efforts are under way to develop an international system of pesticide information exchange and export notification, said <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>. `` Adoption of a system of prior informed consent is an important first step toward improving the information base for many countries,'' he said. `` However, our current notification system must be improved.'' <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Perlis </PERSON> said federal law requires that companies planning to export unregistered pesticides obtain a signed statement from the foreign buyer saying the buyer understands that the pesticide is not allowed to be sold in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` A copy of that statement is then sent to a representative of the foreign country's government,'' said <PERSON> Perlis </PERSON>. He said the registration of pesticides is canceled from time to time by the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> and, when that happens, countries that have purchased the product are notified the reason for the cancellation. `` There is not a pesticide product produced in this country which could not be exported -LRB- under the law -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Perlis </PERSON>. Over the past decade, global pesticide use has doubled, said <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is a major pesticide producer, supplying about one-quarter of the world market, he said, adding that about 25 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pesticide exports are unregistered. <PERSON> Garry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamlin </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said his company follows the law explicitly. He also said, `` We do not ship banned products or products that are severely restricted to other countries _ which is not to say we do not ship products that are not registered in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' He said <PERSON> Dow </PERSON> is seeking registration on a number of products that are not registered here.

<TEXT>
 The `` <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> Jr.'' show and other interview programs with a bent for the weird and rowdy have a place in television because they put viewers in touch with issues, defenders of so-called `` Trash TV'' say. And even if they're just plain bizarre, shows like `` Crime Time'' that feature ex-felons singing, dancing or cooking also deserve to be aired in a free society, a panel of producers, journalists and advertisers said Monday during a lively discussion of television from `` ` MASH' to Trash'' at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION> convention. In a session that at times threatened to veer into a `` Downey'' - brook, <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Downey </PERSON>'s producer, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON>, crossed swords with outraged audience members who said <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> was lowering TV standards `` We're not yelling and hollering about transvestites and mud wrestling,'' <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON> said. `` We're dealing with issues. `` We're raising our voice about things that are on the front page of the <ORGANIZATION> L.A. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>.'' He said the issues <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> treats, such as gun control, politics and the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION>, would generate heated arguments in many homes. As for <PERSON> Downey </PERSON>'s style, he said in a loud voice, `` What is wrong with people raising their voice?'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Crook </PERSON>, a TV writer for the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, said there is a big difference between talk shows of the 1960s and <PERSON> Geraldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>'s show on Monday, which visited <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>'s notorious Mustang Ranch house of prostitution. Crook said <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Geraldo </PERSON> were providing `` an interesting counter'' to traditional journalism and were getting `` people on the street'' to discuss issues. <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON> agreed, saying, `` Our guy has broken the mold of the polite host who's being neutral.'' Moderator <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bohannon </PERSON>, who is the host of `` Crime Time'' and its companion `` The Talk Show'' felon interview progam, suggested that the trend was for television shows to be more sensational. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> said he was concerned about the social effects on children who may watch shows that feed on polarizing their audiences. And <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> censor <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerson </PERSON> said he could foresee an advertiser backlash developing. `` If the environment for the commercial messages is n't acceptable, that could be a problem,'' he said `` If all commercial advertisers decide that the program is n't commercially viable, then the program wo n't be commercially viable. There are a number of checks and balances.'' But in an era of cable TV there are a lot of different voices and different program standards. What is not suitable for <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> may be acceptable on other outlets, he said. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolte </PERSON>, an executive with the <ORGANIZATION> Clorox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Clorox </ORGANIZATION> does n't advertise on such shows because they do n't provide the proper `` environment'' for <ORGANIZATION> Clorox </ORGANIZATION> products. `` Not even toilet bowl cleaner, or something of that nature?'' <PERSON> Bohannon </PERSON> deadpanned to huge laughter in the room.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who received $ 3.5 million to make the transition from candidate to president between his election and inauguration days, has returned more than a third of the money to the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spent $ 2.21 million to facilitate his entry into the nation's highest office and returned $ 1.29 million to the taxpayers, according to the final balance sheet released Monday. Under a new federal law, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had been allocated $ 1.5 million more than former President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to make the transition into office, according to <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON>, comptroller of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, which administers transition accounts. But the increase also tightened regulations for reporting private sector donations. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> raised no private money, said <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON>, who has headed the financial aspects of the transition process since <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> left the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in 1969. `` This was squeaky clean. No outside money, no outside gifts,'' <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON> said. `` The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> people refused to take free <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> typewriters or free General Motors rental cars. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> people took lots of freebies.'' The president spent his transition funds primarily on salaries of the people who assisted in his smooth passage to a new administration, said <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> employed 225 people, compared with the 400 government employees <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> used for the same purpose in 1981. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> spent more than $ 1.7 million for transition, according to <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON>. `` This was a much slimmer transition than <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had,'' said <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON>. `` Smaller people, smaller money. They seem to be a little obsessed with this whole ethics thing.'' The transition allocation for outgoing presidents to spend over the six months after leaving office was increased from $ 1 to $ 1.5 million under the new law, <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s activities have included setting up the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> presidential library.

In May Day celebrations Monday meant to stress the new wave of reform in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, the communist government replaced the traditional parade with a rally. And it organized `` kawiarnias,'' meetings at <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> cafes at which ordinary citizens could exchange views with ranking officials. The sessions were held in several of the coffee-and-cake shops along <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION>, a restored stretch lined by historic buildings. The street was closed to cars and dotted with ice cream vendors and concert stands for the day. The government ministers, who stood in front of bars and cabaret stages in the smoke-filled cafes, talked about politics, economics and other issues with standing-room-only crowds that sat at tables and packed every corner of the columned rooms. Among them was Deputy Prime Minister <PERSON> Ireniusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Sekula </PERSON>, former government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON>, sports minister <PERSON> Aleksander </PERSON> <PERSON> Kwasniewski </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Miodowicz </PERSON>, leader of the official union alliance OPZZ. But as Politburo member <PERSON> Stanislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciosek </PERSON> took questions and even fended off hecklers at the cafe <PERSON> Nowy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swiat </PERSON>, the new spirit of democracy was being tested on the street as riot police clashed with young protesters. <PERSON> Ciosek </PERSON>'s give and take _ `` We are entering a completely new state of things,'' he told one questioner _ was interrupted by shouts from outside. The crowd rushed out to see a row of shield-carrying, helmeted riot police who had closed the street after a clash with demonstrators during which rocks and smoke bombs were thrown. The protesters, young militants who had wandered over from the day's huge Solidarity march, fled after being charged by police.

<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> advisory committee has recommended approval of an aerosol version of a drug that helps prevent a life-threatening pneumonia in AIDS patients. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> is expected to agree and approve an aerosol version of pentamidine within weeks, said an <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> source who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Aerosol pentamidine has been widely available to AIDS patients since the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> in February allowed expanded distribution as an experimental medication under government review. However, many insurance plans do not cover experimental drugs. <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> approval would allow nearly universal reimbursement for AIDS patients using the drug. The advisory committee recommended approval of the drug for preventing bouts of pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, which causes an estimated 60 percent of AIDS deaths. Pentamidine was approved five years ago for use as an injectable drug to treat those already suffering from pneumocycstis. The spray version would make it easier to take into the lungs where the pneumonia infection first shows up.

<HEAD>Suzanne Pleshette Meets Nurses, Asks Them To Help Save ``Nightingales''</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The dessert and hot topic was cheesecake. `` Nightingales'' star <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pleshette </PERSON> ate it as real-life nurses told her how not to portray them as the confection. Miss <PERSON> Pleshette </PERSON> also apologized for the <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> series' portrayal of nurses as doctor-chasing airheads, and asked for their help: Save Our Show. `` You're looking at a hit show that's about to be canceled as a result of the controversy,'' the actress said. `` Unfortunately, now the nurses are in a position to undo what they've done. They have to save us. `` Unless every nurse who wrote a letter before can fax a letter to <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> in the next two days, we may be over and out,'' said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Pleshette </PERSON>, who portrays the `` den mother'' to a group of sex-kitten nurses. Miss <PERSON> Pleshette </PERSON> and co-producer <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Cramer </PERSON> met with nurses at <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> on Monday to discuss how the program could portray nurses more realistically. `` We want the show kept on the air and to reflect nursing and health care as it could be,'' said <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>, nursing administrator at the 201-bed hospital in this town 30 miles west of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The program, which premiered in January and is broadcast on Wednesday nights, has been criticized for demeaning the nursing profession in particular and women generally by portraying five student nurses as lusty bimbos. The program often shows them in racy lingerie, bouncy aerobic workouts and locker-room disrobing sessions. The 189,000-member <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nurses </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> organized a massive letter-writing protest, and sponsors including <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> have withdrawn advertisements from the show. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> is expected to decide whether to renew the show within two weeks. Last week, executive producer <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Spelling </PERSON> said the series would show less skin and more nurses working in uniform if <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> brings it back next season. He also said he would hire a nursing adviser to help the show depict more realistic situations. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nurses </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which has joined in the protest against the show, said the group has been encouraged by the response to their complaints. `` We would certainly want to consider any ways that things could be modified and create a positive image,'' she said in a telephone interview. Ms. <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> said she invited Miss <PERSON> Pleshette </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cramer </PERSON> to <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> because she believed the staff could provide constructive criticism. They talked over a private lunch of shrimp cocktail, followed by cheesecake. `` We consider a show in its first season a work in progress,'' Miss <PERSON> Pleshette </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` We do not deny and we never deny that we made some mistakes.'' After the show's initial episodes, Miss <PERSON> Pleshette </PERSON> said, she objected to the garter belts and bras the actresses wore and ordered `` appropriate'' undergarments. Changes were made but did not appear on television for about four episodes, and well after the protests began, because of the lag in airing prime-time programs, she said. A show about nurses dealing with AIDS, cancer, and other diseases would make the program more interesting, said Ms. <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>. `` What really makes a nurse is what's inside her heart and her mind and how she deals with people and life issues,'' she added. `` That's more dramatic than seeing somebody jump up and down in their tights.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> scientists who captured worldwide attention with their claim to have achieved cold nuclear fusion were probably fooled by faulty calculations, researchers from two of the nation's most prominent science institutes say. Researchers from both the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> are challenging the cold fusion claim made at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said Monday that he and other <ORGANIZATION> Caltech </ORGANIZATION> researchers conducted the most precise effort yet to duplicate the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> experiment and found that no fusion took place. He said the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> scientists calculated a gain in heat, but that precise measurements at <LOCATION> Caltech </LOCATION> showed no such gain. Papers prepared by <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> researchers for presentation today at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> meeting also reported that verification experiments conducted over a five-week period failed to detect any fusion reaction. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrasso </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION>'s Plasma Fusion Center said the amount of neutrons, another fusion byproduct, emitted by the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> experiment was probably much lower than the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> scientists thought. He said the claimed flow was `` inconsistent'' with other data reported from the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> experiment. `` We're asserting that their neutron emission was below what they thought it was, including the possibility that it could have been none at all,'' <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION>'s Plasma Fusion Center, said in a telephone interview Monday. The international physics community has spent millions of dollars over the last quarter century attempting to achieve fusion using massive machines filled with plasma heated to temperatures of up to 100 million degrees. <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> chemist <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> and his collaborator, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southampton </ORGANIZATION>, sent shock waves through the scientific world March 23 when they said they had achieved nuclear fusion using a simple electrochemical cell at room temperature. <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> said the cell used an electrode of palladium and one of platinum that were immersed in a flask of deuterium oxide, or heavy water. The researchers claimed that when an electrical current was applied to the electrodes, deuterium nuclei were jammed into the crystal lattice of the palladium until the nuclei fused. When the fusion occurred, <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> said, the device produced four times more heat than was required to operate the experiment. They later said the ratio of heat produced to heat expended could be up to 8-1. But <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Caltech </ORGANIZATION> researchers found a number of problems with the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> apparatus. `` These problems may lead to errors large enough to cast serious doubts on published determinations of excess heat,'' said <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>. `` When these errors are avoided, we obtain no evidence for excess heat production.'' However, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brophy </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> vice president of research, said, `` The criticisms are n't really different than any we've heard from the beginning.'' Valid objections are welcome, he said, but, `` If it's out of pique, then I do n't think it's helpful. <PERSON> Brophy </PERSON> said the negative results should be judged alongside positive results from such institutions as <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> A & amp; M and Case Western Reserve. <PERSON> Brophy </PERSON> said <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> `` are very good experimenters. I ca n't believe they could carry out ... measurements, as they have done, improperly.'' <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said, have admitted that their report of a 4-1 energy return was based on mathematical calculations and not on actual measurements. He said the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> researchers evidently used incorrect assumptions to make their calculations. He said errors were easily made, for instance, if the heavy water was not stirred to distribute heat evenly from the electrical current. When the measurements were made correctly, said <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, it was obvious that the total heat from the reaction was less than the energy used to operate the experiment. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, meanwhile, said <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> researchers have been working for weeks to verify the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> experiments, but the results did n't hold up when measured against a standard known as a Neutron Capture Gamma Spectrum. `` If -LRB- fusion -RRB- occurred at all, it was far below what they deduced from their measurements,'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said. Part of the problem, <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said, could be that <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> did not directly measure the neutrons released in their experiment. `` The measurement they made was an indirect measurement, not of neutrons directly, but of gamma rays produced by neutrons,'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said. The two MIT researchers said in a paper planned for presentation to the conference that the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> research apparently misinterpreted some crucial data on neutrons. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Caltech </LOCATION> experiments used detection equipment 100,000 times more sensitive than devices used in the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> experiment. He said <ORGANIZATION> Caltech </ORGANIZATION> used instruments to detect and measure any product of fusion, including neutrons or gamma rays, tritium or helium, and any rise in heat. All such measurements, when performed correctly, were negative, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. `` We have no reason to invoke fusion to explain any of their results,'' he said. `` At this point, we can find no evidence of anything except conventional chemistry.''

<TEXT>
 Sinhalese militants early today attacked the country's largest army garrison with grenades and automatic rifles but were beaten back before they could reach the armory, a military official said. At least three militants were killed and five soldiers wounded in the raid, which was launched during a heavy downpour at 1:30 a.m., said the official, who can not be identified under briefing rules. He said at least 100 militants attacked the <LOCATION> Panagoda </LOCATION> army garrison, 12 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, which usually holds between 10,000 and 15,000 soldiers. The attack was the biggest raid on an army post by the militants since they launched an anti-government campaign in 1987 to protest peace overtures to ethnic Tamil rebels. The Sinhalese extremists contend the Sinhalese-dominated government of this <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> island nation is making too many concessions to the Tamil minority. The militants have attacked army camps and police stations in the past to get weapons. The military official said the attackers penetrated the Panagoda garrison's perimeter and came within yards of its armory before being repulsed. Army helicopters and foot patrols searched rice paddies and jungles around the camp for the militants, many of whom are believed to be injured, he said. He said authorities thought the attackers belonged to the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, an ultra-nationalist Sinhalese group. The government has blamed the front for the killings of at least 3,000 people, mostly government officials and supporters, since <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> signed a peace accord in July 1987 aimed at ending a Tamil insurrection that started four years earlier. The largest Tamil rebel group, the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION>, also rejected the 1987 peace accord but opened talks with the government last week. The talks were held after President <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> offered amnesty and seats in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> to the rebels and the Sinhalese militants. The Sinhalese radicals rejected the government's offer. Sinhalese form 75 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 18 million people, and Tamils make up 18 percent.

 A farmer proudly displayed his calloused right index finger, stained with the purple ink designed to ensure that no voter cast more than one vote. In his 60 years, <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Caballero </PERSON> has known little but dictatorship and seen few elections that were not fixed. He said his ink-stained finger represented the hope of change. `` Now we can vote freely for our own candidate with no rushing or pressures,'' said <PERSON> Caballero </PERSON>, a feeling expressed Monday throughout this rural farming town 80 miles east of <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION>, the capital. `` I am over the obligatory voting age, but I came to cast my vote anyway because I have hopes that things will change,'' said <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, 64. The vote Monday to select a president and two-chamber congress to replace the regime of former President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, ousted in a Feb. 3 coup, was mandatory for all Paraguayans between 18 and 60. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, 76, who took power in a 1954 coup, had eight straight times arranged his own election. Rural peasants often were trucked to voting sites, handed ballots for the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and told to place them in the box while party officials looked on. <PERSON> Caballero </PERSON> said he did not cast his ballot for the <ORGANIZATION> Colorados </ORGANIZATION> this time. `` I voted for <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Laino </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Authentic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> because he always fought for freedom,'' added <PERSON> Caballero </PERSON>. Despite the support of voters such as <PERSON> Caballero </PERSON>, the election was won by the general who deposed <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>: <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>. `` I'm going to vote for Gen. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> because he promised many things to the peasants and he brought us democracy,'' said <PERSON> Eulalia </PERSON> <PERSON> Dominguez </PERSON>, 33, in the town of <LOCATION> Caacupe </LOCATION>, 32 miles east of <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION>. Clusters of farmers stood beside the highway in a light drizzle, waiting for flatbed trucks of <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>'s and <PERSON> Laino </PERSON>'s parties, the two largest, to take them to voting sites. Others traveled by bicycle, horse and tractor. Officials at voting sites in several small towns strictly followed regulations, supplying private rooms for citizens to choose in secrecy between the ballots supplied by the eight parties participating in the elections. They also supplied indelible purple ink, furnished by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, to mark voters' right index fingers. In the February 1988 election, only <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> ballots could be found at many voting places and private voting rooms were scarce. But all sides called the election Monday more open. `` Some people are saying these are the cleanest elections in Paraguayan history,'' said <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Jara </PERSON>, 29, who quit his job as a teacher because of low pay and now does odd jobs. `` But I say it is the cleanest fraud,'' he added. `` I would have voted for <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, but you can see that the people around him are just continuing the farce.'' Opposition spokesmen reported some irregularities in voting, such as indelible ink that washed off, registration of new voters by <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> officials on the day of balloting and some mix-ups with voter registration lists. `` Things are somewhat better -LRB- than in 1988 -RRB- but we still have a long way to go,'' said <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Guillen </PERSON>, an observer for the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Febrerista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Arroyo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, 60 miles east of the capital. <PERSON> Lidia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, 64, of <LOCATION> Caacupe </LOCATION>, seemed to take the irregularities in stride. `` It may not be perfect, but at least now we have freedom to choose,'' she said, waiting in line to vote.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> today beatified a 19th century French missionary considered the apostle of the slaves brought to this island, saying he should inspire islanders to fight today's `` slavery of materialism.'' The pope celebrated a beatification Mass on the palm-fringed esplanade of the Notre Dame of the Trinity church. The crowd was estimated at up to 200,000, two-fifths of the entire population of this volcanic <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> island. French Prime Minister <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON>, wearing a straw hat to ward off the tropical sun, headed the official <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> delegation at the ceremony. Reunion has been a French Overseas Territory since 1946, The pope arrived on the island Monday night after a three-day visit to the African island of <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION>, the first stop of his nine-day pilgrimage. He headed later today to <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, traveling for the first time on the Concorde. He is to visit <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION> later in the week and return to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> Saturday. The beatification represented a first step towards possible sainthood for <PERSON> Jean-Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rousseau </PERSON>, known as <PERSON> Brother </PERSON> <PERSON> Scubilion </PERSON>, who died in 1867 at the age of 70. Born in <LOCATION> Burgundy </LOCATION> and baptized secretly during the French Revolution, <PERSON> Rousseau </PERSON> joined the Brother of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schools </ORGANIZATION> and moved to this island, then known as Bourbon, in 1833. He remained 34 years until his death, devoting himself to teaching catechism to the African slaves brought to the island by the French colonists to work the coffee plantations. Described by local church officials as a `` non-violent subversive,'' he is credited with helping create the climate for the abolishment of slavery in 1848. About 70 percent of Reunion's current population are descended from the slaves. Ninety percent of the population is Roman Catholic. `` Brother Scubilion is a remarkable witness of the movement for holiness begun on this island by the first missionaries,'' the white-robed <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said in his homily in French. `` He enlightened others with the light of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> by his example and, especially, by his catechism among the slaves.'' `` He helped them to gain confidence ... to give meaning to their lives, to march toward hope, and he distinguished himself in the service to the sick, showing much compassion for his brothers in distress.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said today's Catholics in Reunion should follow <PERSON> Brother </PERSON> <PERSON> Scubilion </PERSON>'s example and `` build a society more respectful of human dignity, without being afraid of saying no to the slavery of materialism that could seduce you.'' `` On your island, you enjoy a relative abundance,'' he said. `` At the same time, the race to consumerism can lead away from the real evangelist path ...'' Reunion, covering 970 square miles, is the most prosperous of the four stops on the pope's trip. Its economy is based on sugar exports and tourism, and the per capita income is $ 3,500, compared to only a few hundred dollars in the other countries. Earlier today, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> met with a group of youths in the garden of the residence of the local bishops. He cautioned them not to be seeduced by secularization, pornography, casual sex and the `` temptation of magic.'' He did not elaborate on that topic, but local church officials have expressed concern about the spread of superstition, fetishism, exorcism and satanic cults.

<TEXT>
 A federal judge's ruling that <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>' death penalty law is unconstitutional could help to resolve legal questions that have loomed since it was enacted in 1977, experts say <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said Monday the law gives prosecutors too much leeway in deciding when to seek the death penalty, violating <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rulings that states must ensure capital punishment is not imposed in an `` arbitrary and capricious'' manner. If higher courts agree, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s decision would invalidate the sentences of the 121 men currently facing the death penalty in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. Among them is <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacy </PERSON>, convicted of killing 33 young men and boys in the worst multiple-killing case in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s decision marked the first time a federal judge has ruled on the constitutionality of <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>' death penalty law. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has never agreed to hear an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> death penalty case. In the past, legal experts have said a final resolution of the issue was unlikely until federal courts addressed a case focusing solely on the constitutional question. `` I think we've finally got a case where the issue has been squarely addressed in the district court and will be squarely addressed on appeal,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> attorney who has handled appeals of Death - Row inmates Illinois Attorney General <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartigan </PERSON> said the state would appeal the ruling to the 7th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ficaro </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hartigan </PERSON>'s first assistant, said he was confident <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s ruling would be overturned. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has dealt with that issue over 60 times,'' he said. `` We believe the statute is constitutional.'' Because of prolonged appeals no one has been executed under the 1977 statute. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, director of the Illinois chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` We think they're all unconstitutional. I do n't think there's any way to write a death penalty law that's constitutional.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s ruling came in the case of a man who demanded the death penalty after being convicted in 1980 of killing two people in <LOCATION> Vermilion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Appeals on behalf of <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Silagy </PERSON> reached the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> twice and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> once but were unsuccessful until his case reached <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> in one of the last stages of the appeals process. The state's capital punishment law allows a trial court to consider a death sentence in certain circumstances, such as a multiple killing, but only when requested by the prosecution. In 1979, the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled 4-3 that the prosecutors' authority to seek the death penalty is not significantly different than their power to seek criminal prosecution But <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> sided with the dissenting justices in that case. `` Our statute contains no directions or guidelines to minimize the risk of wholly arbitrary and capricious action by the prosecutor in either requesting ... or in not requesting a -LRB- death sentence -RRB- hearing,'' wrote Justice <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, whose opinion was cited by <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>.

 A mysterious oil spill in March that contaminated beaches on two islands has been traced to an inter-island cruise ship, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> announced. Oil samples taken from SS Independence matched samples taken from beaches on <LOCATION> Lanai </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Molokai </LOCATION> and from a slick between the islands, Capt. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Piche </PERSON> told reporters Monday. Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Frame </PERSON>, who represents <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hawaii </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cruises </ORGANIZATION>, which operates the boat, said the company was cooperating with the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> but would do its own investigation to check the findings. `` The company will abide by whatever laws apply,'' he said. Under federal water pollution control laws, the company could face a maximum civil penalty of $ 5,000 and would have to repay the government for the cost of the cleanup, which is estimated at more than $ 100,000, <PERSON> Piche </PERSON> said. The findings will be turned over to a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> hearings officer within six weeks, <PERSON> Piche </PERSON> said. It will be up to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office to press criminal charges, which carry a maximum penalty of a $ 10,000 fine, he added. <PERSON> Piche </PERSON> said the boat apparently dumped about 10,000 gallons of bunker fuel oil into the ocean by accident while pumping fresh water out of ballast tanks on the night of March 24. The spill washed ashore along a 10-mile stretch of the east end of <LOCATION> Molokai </LOCATION> and along 10 miles of the northeast side of <LOCATION> Lanai </LOCATION>. There have been no reports of any damage to wildlife, <PERSON> Piche </PERSON> said. Company officials were informed Monday of the findings and `` their reaction was they did n't see how it could have happened,'' <PERSON> Piche </PERSON> said.

 For <PERSON> Lynette </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, there may be a $ 16-an-hour pot of gold at the end of the oil spill cleanup rainbow. She and hundreds of others have crowded into this Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> community in search of work and hefty paychecks. They live in mobile homes, school buses, soggy tents. Mostly, they wait. `` We've got all our pigs in a poke and our options working,'' said <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, a gold miner from a town near <LOCATION> Fairbanks </LOCATION> who has been here a week. She set up housekeeping in her battered green car in a gravel parking lot. `` Things have n't gotten savage here, yet,'' she said, smiling. `` They might, but they have n't. It's a real boom-town atmosphere. It's so similar to the North Slope in the 1970s when they were building the pipeline.'' <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> has said it will hire 4,000 people by early June to help clean up the nation's worst oil spill. After loading up at the trans-Alaska pipeline terminal here, the Exxon Valdez rammed <LOCATION> Bligh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reef </LOCATION> on March 24, dumping more than 10 million gallons of heavy North Slope crude oil into Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. The oil has moved out of the sound, soiling Gulf of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> beaches. When word of <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s initial cleanup plan got out, a steady stream of job hunters headed to <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Job </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> office, which tries to match employers with workers, has been forced to bring in three additional staff members and stay open seven days a week to keep up. `` In the last two weeks, the number coming through this office has grown daily,'' said the agency's <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. `` We're averaging 500 a day. That's in a town with a population of 3,000. And the volume is growing, definitely growing.'' Before the spill, perhaps 20 people a day came looking for work, she said. Now, jobs for waitresses, cooks, maids go begging. A bulletin board in the jobs agency is covered with cards seeking workers. But most of the newcomers are holding out for the big banana, an Exxon job ankle deep in oil. The <ORGANIZATION> Job </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> receives up to 300 telephone calls a day from people seeking work. The calls come from as far away as <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>. For those in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, the agency starts its day early. Weary-looking men and women start lining up down the block at 5:30 a.m., waiting for the office to open at 7. A stampede through the doors as they opened one day last week pinned two <ORGANIZATION> Job </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> workers against a wall. A security guard was hired to keep order. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, an unemployed painter, has been here a week, living in his car, showing up each day at the crack of dawn, hoping for a 12-hour-a-day, $ 16-an-hour Exxon job. `` It's wait, wait, wait. They do n't tell you anything,'' he said. The Job Service is providing non-union job applications for one of <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s contractors, <ORGANIZATION> VECO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> VECO </ORGANIZATION> will only look at applications submitted by <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> residents. She said federal law prohibits release of the number of people hired by <ORGANIZATION> VECO </ORGANIZATION> or any other employer. But she said hundreds of people have been hired through the agency since the spill. <ORGANIZATION> Norcon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, another oil field service contractor, is hiring union labor for <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> through Laborers Local 341. Twice a day, seven days a week, the cramped, smoke-filled hallway outside the tiny union office is jammed with job seekers. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> McPheters </PERSON>, business agent for the local, said 40 people a day sign up to join the union. More than 700 have signed up. The local normally has about 65 members. The union has sent out more than 500 potential workers since the spill, and about 80 percent went to <LOCATION> Norcon </LOCATION>, <PERSON> McPheters </PERSON> said. He said the union has been trying to ensure that Alaskans with at least a year of residency get the jobs. `` We want to put our Alaskans to work. They've been through some hard times,'' he said. `` And we have plenty of qualified Alaskans.''

 Gen. <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, who ousted strongman <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> three months ago, was elected president by an overwhelming margin and his party kept control of congress, unofficial returns showed today. The leaders and presidential candidates of four opposition parties denounced what they said were `` shameful irregularities'' in Monday's voting and did not concede defeat. Foreign observers and diplomats agreed that there were irregularities, but said the balloting was reasonably fair and that victory clearly belonged to <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, who had been <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s No 2 man. `` We promise our people that we will carry <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> on a bright path to its destiny of greatness and happiness,'' a grinning <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said in a champagne toast to party members late Monday at his chateau-style mansion. His <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has ruled this landlocked country of 4 million people since 1947. <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Laino </PERSON>, the presidential candidate of the <ORGANIZATION> Authentic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and a former exile, finished second. In initial official returns released early today <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> tallied 22,201 of the 29,293 votes for president, or 75.8 percent, and the <ORGANIZATION> Colorados </ORGANIZATION> garnered 19,883, or 68.4 percent, of 29,064 votes for congress. The <ORGANIZATION> Colorados </ORGANIZATION> said their partial count showed that of 1,048,299 votes for president, <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> received 778,479, or 74.3 percent. Official and unofficial tallies gave <PERSON> Laino </PERSON> about 20 percent of the vote. The <ORGANIZATION> Colorados </ORGANIZATION> received 741,583 votes of 1,007,548 cast for congress, or 73.6 percent, according to the party's count. Tallies by the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and a coalition of sociological research firms had lower totals, but also showed one-sided counts in favor of <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Colorados </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, 65, deposed <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> in a coup on Feb. 3 and sent him into exile in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, promising broadened civil liberties and pledging to move the country toward democracy. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, who seized power in a 1954 coup, had arranged to be elected every five years through patronage and intimidation. The voting Monday was to replace <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> and the 36-member senate and 72-seat chamber of deputies that were to have served through August 1993. By law the <ORGANIZATION> Colorados </ORGANIZATION>, as the winning party in the congressional elections, would receive 24 of the 36 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seats and 48 of the 72 seats in the Chamber of deputies. The partial <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> vote count represented about 45 percent of the 2.2 million people on official voter registration lists. The opposition had claimed the list was dated and bloated, and even the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said it might contain as many as 600,000 duplicate or fake names. `` From the first moment of voting, serious difficulties and grave fraud occurred, which offend our civic culture and test our tolerance to the limit,'' said <PERSON> Laino </PERSON>. Election observers and local party officials said space was n't always set aside to allow citizens to vote in private; ballots for a specific party often were missing; some voters were not permitted to cast ballots and not every station had indelible ink to mark fingers and prevent double voting <PERSON> Euclides </PERSON> <PERSON> Acevedo </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Febrerista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, accused the <ORGANIZATION> Colorados </ORGANIZATION> of stealing his party's ballots at some voting places. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaves </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, accused <PERSON> Laino </PERSON> supporters of doing the same to his party. `` Yes, there were irregularities, but how significant they were, I'm not sure,'' said British Ambassador <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>. `` I think it was a very good attempt at something they have never done before.'' Voters stood in long lines in chilly fall weather and a light drizzle to cast ballots. `` My party was founded in 1965. This is the first time we're participating in elections,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Caceres </PERSON>, 28, a Christian Democrat `` People are hopeful,'' he said, standing in a school courtyard. `` The period of <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> has n't ended ... but this is a beneficial transition _ peaceful, with people getting used to democracy.'' <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> named himself provisional president after ousting <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> and, distancing himself from the regime, improved relations with foreign governments and the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, to which most Paraguayans belong. In <PERSON> Coronel </PERSON> <PERSON> Oviedo </PERSON>, a large rural town east of the capital, <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, a 64-year-old peasant, said Monday: `` I am past the age where voting is mandatory, but I came to cast my ballot because I have hopes that things will change from now on.'' Voting was mandatory for citizens ages 18 to 60 and failure to vote punishable by a small fine.

 For the second time in three years, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> say someone has swiped their infant daughter, but few neighbors are rushing to their defense. `` It just seems too strange,'' said <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Hailer </PERSON>, who lives across the street. `` We do n't have kidnappings here _ and not two in one family.'' The <PERSON> Simses </PERSON> said 6-week-old <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> was abducted Saturday night under circumstances almost identical to the disappearance of their 13-day-old daughter, <PERSON> Loralei </PERSON>, three years ago. <PERSON> Loralei </PERSON>'s body was found five days later, about 150 feet from the <PERSON> Simses </PERSON>' home in <LOCATION> Brighton </LOCATION>, 10 miles from this town of 40,000 residents. No cause of death was determined and no arrest was made in that case, although authorities said the parents were suspects. On Monday, police in this <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> town across from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, said they were treating <PERSON> Heather </PERSON>'s disappearance as a kidnapping reported by the parents. `` But we're not ruling anything out,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, chief of detectives. `` They said they feel someone is out to get them,'' <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> said. `` But they do n't have anyone specific ... and have n't given us any names.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> was approached by reporters as he arrived at his home Monday night. `` I ca n't say anything,'' he said, citing the advice of police. `` I do n't mean to be rude, I just ca n't say anything.'' A steady stream of cars drove past the house Monday night, with most motorists slowing long enough to get a good look. Neighbors were peering out of windows and doors. Mrs. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> said she was approached by a gunman outside their home Saturday night while her husband was at work at a steel plant, said Sgt. <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> Pyatt </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> told police she was forced back into the house and knocked unconscious. An hour later, she told authorities, her husband returned home and revived her, but <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> was gone. A hospital found no evidence of injury when they checked Mrs. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> _ `` no bruises or anything,'' <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> said. `` There is nothing that disproves their allegations,'' he said. `` But we are not discounting the information from the other case.'' Even the times of the reported abductions are similar. In 1986, Mrs. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> said she was attacked about 10:20 p.m. And on Saturday, she told police the assailant struck at 10:30 p.m., after she returned from taking out the trash. Neighbors said the couple, who also have a 15-month-old son, have kept to themselves since they moved from <LOCATION> Brighton </LOCATION> to their two-story home in <LOCATION> Alton </LOCATION> about two years ago. `` All I can tell you is I never saw them,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Hailer </PERSON> said. `` I saw her once in two years. I did n't even know she had children. They put up the fence when they first moved in and that's the last anybody ever saw of them.'' Police said the couple's young son was sleeping in the house at the time but was not disturbed. No valuables were reported missing from the house. In <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where the <PERSON> Simes </PERSON> lived in 1986 when they reported the first abduction, Sheriff <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Yocom </PERSON> said they were suspects in <LOCATION> Loralei </LOCATION>'s death. During a grand jury investigation, the couple declined to testify, citing their constitutional right against self-incrimination, <PERSON> Yocom </PERSON> said. The grand jury returned no indictment. Asked about the new case, <PERSON> Yocom </PERSON> replied: `` It's unbelievable.''

 A woman who was severely beaten and raped in Central Park by a gang of youths has shown signs of emerging from a coma, and gave a `` high five'' sign for a hospital worker, doctors said. The 28-year-old woman remained in a coma Monday and physicians were not optimistic about her chances for a full recovery, but she has squeezed hands, raised her eyebrows, smiled at jokes and nodded vigorously, said Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON>. `` Over the last day our patient has shown an increased level of alertness,'' <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON> told reporters at <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. `` She certainly is n't fully awake and we're still in some concern about ultimate outcome,'' he added. `` But obviously these changes are for the better.'' The victim, an investment banker, was jumped by the gang April 19 as she jogged through an isolated section of Central Park on her nightly run. Six teen-agers have been indicted on charges of attempted murder, rape, sodomy and assault. <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON> said an electroencephalogram, a measure of brain waves known as an EEG, showed `` a better pattern than last week.'' The woman's eyes are now open some of the time, he said. Neurologists use a scale of 3 to 15 to measure brain function. The woman came into the hospital at 4 or 5, improved to 7 for most of last week, and now is roughly an 11, just below consciousness, <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON> said. `` She's not completely, totally comatose,'' he said. On Sunday, a hospital staff member asked her to give a `` high five'' and the woman, who was in semi-upright, raised her hand, <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON> said she sometimes raises her eyebrows when her name is called, squeezes hands when asked, and once nodded vigorously when asked if she wanted to see one of her Wall Street co-workers. `` There's just too many of these experiences to ignore them or totally downplay them,'' he said. Nonetheless, he said doctors were `` pretty concerned about whether she'll make a full recovery. It's not out of the question. ... The woods are full of stories of amazing recoveries when no one ever expected it.'' The odds, however, are that she will have a `` significant neurological deficit,'' the extent of which wo n't be known for some time, he said.

 Nearly 6,000 students calling for democracy and press freedom marched today in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, and students in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> threatened to march in the capital again unless the government recognizes their union in 24 hours. The <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> students set out in the early afternoon from <ORGANIZATION> Fudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and marched to the downtown People's Square. The official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said they carried banners reading `` Give us democracy and freedom,'' `` Oppose privileges'' and `` Media must tell the truth.'' It said they planned to present a petition to local officials. In <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, a delegation of 65 students from 33 schools delivered an ultimatum to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s legislature, <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The students are demanding the government recognize and hold talks with independent associations they have set up during their 2-week-old pro-democracy campaign. They want a free press, freedom of assembly and publication and an end to official corruption. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>, a student leader from <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said the government had agreed to respond by the deadline, noon Wednesday. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> students already have defied police warnings and marched five times since April 17 to <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, the country's symbolic seat of power About 70,000 students at 41 colleges also have been boycotting class since April 24. After a march on Thursday drew cheers and applause from tens of thousands of bystanders, the government held a series of meetings with invited students. However, most of the invited students have been members of officially established unions that student protesters have rejected since the demonstrations started. The government has said the students' new associations are illegal. Representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Universities </ORGANIZATION>, an umbrella group for the new student groups, said their ultimatum listed 12 conditions for a dialogue, beginning with recognition of the association. Other conditions included government willingness to discuss a free press and disclosure by officials of their financial records. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Xitong </PERSON> and city party chief <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Ximing </PERSON> told invited students at a meeting Sunday that they each earn about $ 80 a month, abut 50 percent more than the average factory worker. But students later complained that <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Li </PERSON> did not mention job perks, including comfortable apartments, free meals and use of government cars. If the government refuses to recognize the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> students will hold another march on Thursday, student activists said. Thursday is the 70th anniversary of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s first democratic movement, in which about 3,000 <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> students marched to protest Japanese occupation of Chinese territory. The students also called then for democratic and scientific reforms to strengthen the country against foreign encroachment. Last Thursday, about 150,000 students and ordinary citizens marched through <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in the biggest demonstration in 40 years of Communist rule. Student activists said they do n't expect as large a turnout if they march again this week. Many students have gone home for the May Day holiday and are not expected to return until next week, said one student at <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> whose red armband marked him as an activist. `` Student emotions are relatively calm now, but they will be easily aroused,'' he said. Student posters at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> called for a letter campaign to protest the dismissal of <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> editor <PERSON> Qin </PERSON> <PERSON> Benli </PERSON>. He was fired from the <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> weekly after rejecting government orders not to publish articles calling for a reassessment of former <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON>, who was ousted in 1987 for being too liberal. Hu's death on April 15 triggered the student protests. A telegram sent to <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> officials by <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> researchers warned, `` Anyone who blocks the course of democratization in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will be judged severely by the people.''

 Members of a rural church shaken by the slayings of their minister, his wife and two daughters have settled into the rituals of mourning, accepting condolences from neighbors and the minister's teen-age son. The peace inside the <ORGANIZATION> Olive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Branch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brethren </ORGANIZATION> in Christ, perched near the top of a small rise amid greening trees and freshly tilled fields, was shattered Sunday by the slayings. The bodies of the Rev. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelley </PERSON>, 38, his 32-year-old wife, <PERSON> Dawn </PERSON>, and daughters <PERSON> Janel </PERSON>, 8, and <PERSON> Jolene </PERSON>, 6, were found in the parsonage Sunday morning after the family failed to appear for services. Investigators say the slayings may have occurred Saturday afternoon. Police have ruled out burglary or theft, as well as murder-suicide. They have refused to discuss possible motives. The four victims all apparently were shot at close range with the same weapon, said <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joseph </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's Sgt. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Feirrell </PERSON>. Autopsy results were not expected before today, he said. In an act of condolence Monday, members of neighboring churches brought cold cuts, salads and soft drinks for the congregation that gathered informally at the church. `` Even people who do n't go to any church were bringing things,'' said <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>, superintendent of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brethren </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, which includes part of northern <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. Joining the mourners was <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelley </PERSON>, 17, the minister's only son. He returned to the parsonage Monday after being gone Saturday and Sunday for his high school prom and a visit with friends at an amusement park north of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pelley </PERSON> entered the one-story frame house where his father, stepmother and stepsisters died. He emerged moments later with a garbage bag filled with belongings and crossed the gravel parking lot to console grieving members of the congregations. Some members embraced and wept. `` You have a bond here that a lot of times you do n't find in a bigger church,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorpe </PERSON>, a former pastor at the church. The church's communion Bible was opened to a verse of the Old Testament book of <PERSON> Isaiah </PERSON> that said `` the righteous perisheth.'' A financial statement posted on the bulletin board showed <PERSON> Pelley </PERSON> earned $ 1,250 a month, and the church bank balance totaled $ 254.94. The Pelleys had married after their first spouses died, congregation members said. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON>, 14, were <PERSON> Pelley </PERSON>'s children from his first marriage, and <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON>, 10, <PERSON> Janel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jolene </PERSON> came from Ms. <PERSON> Pelley </PERSON>'s first marriage <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> was attending a church camp when the killings occurred, and <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> had spent the night with friends, police said. The Rev. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Merrilatt </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brethren </ORGANIZATION> pastor from a nearby town, said <PERSON> Pelley </PERSON> had just written a paper on merging broken families for a counseling course they were attending at <ORGANIZATION> Huntington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Merrilatt </PERSON> said <PERSON> Pelley </PERSON> had talked about friction among the children in the new family, but declined to elaborate. However, church member <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> <PERSON> Roush </PERSON>, 66, said she babysat frequently for the <PERSON> Pelley </PERSON>'s younger children and noticed no signs of strain. `` They all got along fine,'' she said.

<TEXT>
 Most of the West can expect a nearly normal fire season after five years of drought-fueled infernos, but there is still a `` great potential'' for fire in the parched <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>, officials say. `` We're not in bad shape right now,'' <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, staff meteorologist at the <ORGANIZATION> Interagency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, said Monday. `` I do n't think we're going to see much until we get into the actual summer.'' Increased precipitation has relieved drought conditions in many areas, including parts of the <LOCATION> Rockies </LOCATION> that were ravaged by fire last year, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. But uncertain prospects for more wet weather in coming months still cloud the fire outlook, he said. Weather forecasters `` tell us that from May to July we have equal chances of above-normal or below-normal precipitation and above-normal or below-normal temperatures,'' said <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>. `` That basically says it's unclear what the outlook is.'' Ironically, the improved precipitation could heighten the danger of range fires in many areas by promoting the growth of grass that could serve as fuel later, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who is responsible for outdoor fire danger forecasts nationwide, said he was compiling data for a report due to be released late this week. The biggest danger area is the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>. Much lower-than-normal winter snowfall and spring rains pose a fire threat in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and southern parts of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. `` There's not much question ... -LRB- of -RRB- a great potential right now'' for wildfires in those areas, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` The fuels are already drying out.'' Soil and debris on the forest floor in parts of northern <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> are as dry now as they were in August, he said. The next greatest fire potential is in the intermountain region _ northern portions of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, southern <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and parts of eastern <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> _ where the snowpack is melting rapidly and the long-range forecast calls for warm temperatures, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaiser </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION> said the snowmelt in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> was `` 10 to 14 days ahead of normal,'' reducing a snowpack that was normal as of mid-April to 80 percent to 85 percent of normal now. Despite four small forest fires during a warm, windy spell last weekend in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the outlook for the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> and the northern <LOCATION> Rockies </LOCATION> is near normal, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. The largest blaze, a 308-acre fire on <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s Olympic Peninsula, was stopped dead by cooler, damper weather Monday, said <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Containment was expected today. The <ORGANIZATION> Rockies </ORGANIZATION>, including fire-ravaged <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>, `` have gotten their fair share of precipitation,'' leading to `` quite a decrease in the drought conditions that existed earlier,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. The situation could deteriorate, however, as high pressure and relatively dry weather is likely to remain over the middle of the country for the next 30 days, he said. Last year, the <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION> command center recorded 7,250 wildfires on more than 5 million acres of land _ an area more than 1 -LCB- times the size of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. That was 30 percent more than the 1983-87 annual average number of fires and 137 percent more than the average annual acreage.

<HEAD>`Largely New York,' Starring Bill Irwin, Opens on Broadway</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS three grafs with other New York reviews; no PMs planned.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 `` Largely <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' a <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> extravaganza that he also wrote and directed, is a merry marriage of video and vaudeville. The show is tailor-made for people who have trouble figuring out how to operate their VCRs. That means just about everyone should enjoy this innovative entertainment, which opened Monday at <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION>'s St. James Theater. <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON>, wearing a Mad Hatter chapeau, baggy pants, oversized glasses and an eager smile, is one of those clowns who knows the history of funny business, particularly the sublime antics of <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Keaton </PERSON>. But he also has a fascination with the present, especially the ever-changing technology of television that has reshaped the performance arena for clown comedy. What <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> has done with `` Largely <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'' is bring past and present together. In the show, he plays a good-natured Everyman called `` The Post-Modern Hoofer,'' a character determined to tap his way through `` Tea for Two'' if only he could get what sounds like the Mighty Wurlitzer to finish playing the tune. He never does, and the interruptions are what `` Largely <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'' is all about. Along the way, he encounters a variety of characters, people who inhabit that peculiar cultural environment called <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. During his 75-minute adventure, the clown meets a pretty modern dancer, two breakdancing experts, a video production crew and a gaggle of academics, dressed in caps and gowns and looking like a convention of angry headwaiters. <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON>'s journey, made without any dialogue, is controlled by a demented remote control device which he carries. He uses it to turn on stage lights, raise and lower curtains and activate various musical soundtracks. <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> swoons for dancer <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Eginton </PERSON>, who spoofs the angular, jerky movements of modern dance. Her choreographed actions are similar to the precision steps of <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Chesney </PERSON> and <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Clemente </PERSON>, two terrific breakdancers who deservedly earn cheers for their gymnastic feats of wonder. The clown, a sweet romantic, follows Miss Eginton _ not only in person but on a video monitor provided by someone called a `` videographer'' and his assistant. In a way, <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> has more of a relationship with this video equipment than he does with real people. In one instance, he becomes entangled in a video camera tripod and performs a kind of pas de deux with the equipment. The tripod leads. In another, the comedian manages to find himself trapped inside a television monitor and then needs help from his breakdancing friends and a bright orange vacuum cleaner to get out. The vacuum finally whooshes <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> out of the tube and into his battered old actor's trunk. A nifty trick. In a third encounter, <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> dances with his screen image and ends up being reprimanded by his TV counterpart for getting carried away. <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> also battles the stage curtain _ and loses _ but not before he is carried high above the audience by this man-eating piece of red cloth. The clown also is badgered by the disapproving academics who follow him around the stage. One of them, called the Dean, ends up falling into the orchestra pit. But he's a game fellow, particularly as played by <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> who gives new meaning to the word pratfall. He keeps coming back for more and gets it, eventually swan-diving into the pit. Much of this foolishness gets captured on tape by the videographer, and <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> ends up appearing in and watching the show at the same time. The line between reality and illusion blurs, but they are linked by laughter. It's a laughter that <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> conjures up in the most inventive and dazzling way possible. In other reviews, The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> said <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> `` cuts a most human figure on stage and even allows himself a final-curtain kiss, but his clowning, however slapstick, often remains austerely intellectual in its preoccupations.'' <PERSON> Clive </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, writing in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> `` is an enormous talent still trying to find a proper outlet.'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissel </PERSON>, writing in the Daily News, said the work sometimes seems `` repetitive and facile, but it's full of an irrepressible, impish imagination.''

 Up to 2,000 militant leftists left a May Day street festival in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and clashed with police into early today, smashing windows, overturning cars and leaving more than 320 officers injured, authorities said. <ORGANIZATION> Hesse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> radio called it the worst violence in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> in the 1980s. The young leftist protesters, many of them wearing black hoods to hide their identities, had broken off from the street festival in the <LOCATION> Kreuzberg </LOCATION> district to take part in the violence. Several vehicles, including police vehicles, were turned over by the protesters and set afire, police said. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> police, in a statement to the news media, said 322 policemen were injured in the rampaging, at least 14 of them hospitalized for treatment. The statement said 16 people were arrested. At least 120 police vehicles called in to quell the rioting were damaged by rocks or firebombs and windows and doors of more than 100 buildings were smashed in the melee, police said. There was no immediate estimate of damage, and cleanup crews were still working this morning to clear <LOCATION> Kreuzberg </LOCATION> streets of rubble left behind by the rioting. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Kreuzberg </LOCATION> district, which is home to many leftist and student groups, has often been the scene of disturbances over the years.

<TEXT>
 The state gaming commission has forced billionaire developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> into an agreement that will regulate his purchase of stocks, bonds or other assets of his casino industry competitors. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> _ who owns two <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> casinos, a third under construction and has plans for two non-casino hotels _ acceded to the pact Monday in an attempt to assure renewal of his gaming license by the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Under the agreement, <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> will have to obtain prior approval from state regulators before acquiring interests in gaming industry corporations in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. A vote on the proposed renewal of <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s gaming license for the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino and Trump Castle Hotel & amp; Casino was scheduled for May 10. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> went along with the restriction after regulators questioned his investment in an aborted plan to take over <ORGANIZATION> Caesars </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> last year, his major competitor in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> bought 600,000 _ or 2.5 percent _ of the shares of <ORGANIZATION> Caesars </ORGANIZATION> stock despite a warning in 1987 from <ORGANIZATION> Casino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Read </PERSON>. Although <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> is the dominant force in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s real estate and gaming industries, <PERSON> Caesar </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Hotel-Casino was the resort's top money winner in 1988, according to state figures. The Trump Plaza was second. Caesars posted a $ 307.6 million profit for 1988, a 6.7 percent increase over 1987. Trump Plaza was next, with $ 300.9 million, a 23 percent increase over the previous year. The agreement on stock purchases was worked out behind closed doors between chairman Read and <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>. At the meeting, Read repeated his displeasure with <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s attempted takeover of <ORGANIZATION> Caesars </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> Read and Commissioner <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> have made it clear they do not want to see the industry run by the free-wheeling rules of Monopoly, the board game that made <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s street names famous. Besides two operating gaming halls, <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s third casino, the <ORGANIZATION> Taj </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mahal </ORGANIZATION>, is under construction. The developer says it will be the world's largest gaming hall when completed next year. Last month, <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> purchased the abandoned Penthouse casino project and announced plans to turn it into a 1,000-room non-casino hotel. He also has signed an agreement to buy the bankrupt <ORGANIZATION> Atlantis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> for $ 63 million and turn it into a hotel without gaming.

<HEAD>Florida Destroys Swarm of `Killer Bees'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A swarm of about 500 Africanized honeybees, popularly known as `` killer bees,'' has been destroyed at <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s port, state officials said The bees, hitchhiking on the outside of a container brought in from <LOCATION> Suriname </LOCATION> aboard the freighter <PERSON> Werner </PERSON>, were discovered April 21 by workers at the Omni Terminal in downtown <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, Agriculture Commissioner <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Conner </PERSON> said Monday. The bees were destroyed that day by a state inspector, but as a precaution additional bait hives have been placed in the port and surrounding area. It is the fifth swarm of the highly aggressive bees that has been discovered and destroyed in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in the last four years. Last May, a swarm of about 10,000 was found at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> aboard a freighter carrying fruit and vegetables from <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Conner </PERSON> said his department has had about two dozen bait hives at <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s port, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> for some time. The additional bait hives put in place since the swarm was discovered will bring the number to more than 50. `` The first bait hive we ever placed was in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> because it's an area we've always been concerned about,'' <PERSON> Conner </PERSON> said `` There is just a tremendous interchange between <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and Central and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> countries, virtually all of which are now infested with Africanized bees.'' State and federal inspectors monitor up to 300 bait hives in 13 port areas in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. The bees have been migrating north from <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> since the 1950s and now are in the central part of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. They are expected to reach the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> border sometime next year. Officials in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> are not expecting them to arrive through the normal migration process for another four or five years. Meantime, they are concentrating their efforts on eradicating any accidental introductions. The Africanized bees' venom is not more potent than that of European honeybees that are common throughout the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but they are more dangerous because they are likely to sting in greater numbers due to their aggressive nature. They are hard to distinguish from domestic bees, although slightly smaller.

 As election day draws near, expressions of hostility between <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s leaders are on the rise. On Monday, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s military accused <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces of spying on its bases and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> accused Panamanian forces of holding some of its soldiers and their families at gunpoint while searching their apartments. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy toward <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> has become a major issue in the campaign for Sunday's presidential election. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has tried to oust Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the leader of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s armed forces and the power behind the government, through economic sanctions and support of the political opposition. A communique Monday from Lt. Col. <PERSON> Aristides </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON>, an officer in the Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> had been told to `` abstain from snooping in a suspicious and covert manner around military installations of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.'' This activity, the communique added, `` constitutes a violation of the Torrijos-Carter Treaties.'' The treaties, signed in 1977, regulate relations between the two countries and their militaries until Dec. 31, 1999, when the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> is to be transferred to Panamanian control. Maj. <PERSON> Edgardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> jets `` consistently make treetop-level flights over areas around military installations.'' `` They also send people dressed as civilians in rental cars with cameras to watch military bases, and they have set up electronic surveillance just off the coast,'' he said. The Southern Command denied all the charges. `` All flights out of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military installations have flight plans filed. Any complaints by the Panamanian Defense Forces are investigated, and so far we have not found any allegation to be true,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> spokesman on condition of anonymity. He added that several weeks ago the Panamanians arrested a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officer who was birdwatching with a camera and field glasses near a military installation. The officer, who was new to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, was released after a short detention, the spokesman said. For its part, the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> complained Monday that <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> security forces had entered apartments of several <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> service members and held them at gunpoint while saying they were searching for weapons. The Command, in a communique, said Panamanian forces surrounded the building in a <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> suburb on Saturday, cut telephone lines, and forcibly entered the apartments. It said Panamanians live in the building too, but only units of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel and their families were searched. No one was reported injured or arrested in the incident. Panamanian police declined comment. They have been carrying out searches recently for what they call `` subversives.'' On April 6, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen was arrested and accused of running a clandestine radio station broadcasting anti-government messages. In the election, the government is backing <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Duque </PERSON>, a close associate of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. An opposition coalition is backing <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has been indicted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug charges.

<TEXT>
 Gen. <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, the apparent winner of his country's presidential election, is a career officer with a populist touch. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, 65, ran Monday as the candidate for the <ORGANIZATION> Colorados </ORGANIZATION>, the powerful and well-organized party that has ruled this semitropical, landlocked nation since 1947. Party affiliation aside, <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> won wide popular support for leading the Feb. 3 coup that toppled Gen. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, ending his 34 years of autocratic rule. The stocky, black-haired general named himself acting president and, to the surprise of many Paraguayans, called for general elections, accepted the <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> candidacy and campaigned for democracy and human rights. `` The man seems to have become the latter-day saint of democracy,'' said <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Vera </PERSON>, presidential candidate of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Febrerista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> further surprised his countrymen by legalizing eight political parties banned under <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, approving an extra five-week voter registration period to allow opposition parties time to sign up members and attending 21 political rallies. His chief rival, former exile <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Laino </PERSON>, reminded Paraguayans, however, that the general served from 1961 to 1989 as head of the Asuncion-based 1st <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> and was <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s close aide <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said he collaborated with the regime out of `` discipline and obedience'' as a military officer. The Rev. <PERSON> Ismael </PERSON> <PERSON> Rolon </PERSON>, the Roman Catholic archbishop of <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION> and a frequent critic of <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, said it was too early to assess <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>'s ability to govern. But, he added, `` In the few contacts we have had he seems to be a man of good intentions.'' Born into a rural farm family, <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> entered the army as a cadet at age 18 and quickly earned the nickname `` Tiger'' for his perseverance and willingness to fight to achieve goals. Reports published abroad have suggested <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> may have been involved in narcotics trafficking. He emphatically denies the charge. Other reports have suggested the general's luxurious home in <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION> and his wealth are due to involvement in contraband and questionable business associations. `` He is a wealthy man, a very wealthy man, one of the richest men in the country, maybe the richest,'' said a foreign diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity. The diplomat noted that <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> owns the country's largest foreign exchange house, an aircraft importing firm and has huge cattle and land holdings as well as part ownership of a flour mill and brewery. `` They say he has an exchange house, but that is because the owners are his friends,'' said <PERSON> Blas </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riquelme </PERSON>, a businessman who says he has known <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> for nearly 26 years. `` He always has helped businessmen out and so people say he is a partner in this or that,'' <PERSON> Riquelme </PERSON> said. `` But there is no proof nor will there ever be any because he is a simple working man who has earned his wealth honestly.'' During the campaign, <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> often cited his humble origins and delighted supporters with spontaneous talks in <LOCATION> Guarani </LOCATION>, the native Indian language spoken by most Paraguayans. `` He knows the psychology of the Paraguayan people much better than <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, who always was formal,'' said Roman Catholic Bishop <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Melanio </PERSON> <PERSON> Medina </PERSON>, a human rights leader. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, unlike <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, included his family in the political campaign and reportedly consulted closely with his wife <PERSON> Nelly </PERSON> and three daughters after speeches. He relaxed by playing with his 10 nieces and nephews. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> plays tennis, sometimes with <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Towell </PERSON>, and likes to ride horses.

<HEAD>Ruling Halts Deportation of Salvadorans</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A federal judge has ordered immigration officials to stop deporting hundreds of Salvadorans from a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> detention center. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> said the aliens were denied a chance to seek political asylum. <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> ruled that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> violated his previous order to provide help to Salvadorans at the <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Isabel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Processing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. `` Out of a group of 67 Salvadorans deported from <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Isabel </LOCATION> on April 20, none was represented by counsel at their deportation hearings,'' he said in his preliminary injunction issued Friday and made public Monday. `` The court finds it difficult to believe that each of these individuals learned of and knowingly and effectively waived his or her right to counsel.'' <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> also ordered the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> to hold group presentations advising the detention center inmates of their rights. Last month, an attorney for the Los Angeles-based <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refugee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> sought an order requiring that legal counsel be provided the immigrants. Activists had argued that a stepped-up enforcement program had led to the detention of thousands of people at <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Isabel </LOCATION>, and that many faced deportation hearings without legally-required access to a lawyer. <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON>'s order remains in effect pending a May 30 hearing.

<TEXT>
 Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> arrived here today for a one-day visit intended to reinforce the ties between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and this island nation. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> paid a courtesy call on President Wee <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wee </PERSON>, whose job is primarily ceremonial, before trying to squeeze in a round of golf. Later in the day, the vice president was to see Prime Minister <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yew </PERSON>, political leader of the tiny nation since it achieved independence in 1965. High on the agenda were issues of trade and defense as well as the future of neighboring <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> after the Vietnamese occupation troops leave this fall. <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> is a close <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ally although tensions developed in the relationship last year after the expulsion of an American diplomat who was accused by the <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> government of meddling in internal politics. In the past, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has raised questions about the government's detention of its political opponents. Earlier, before leaving <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told reporters he `` re-established a strong friendship'' with <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Suharto </PERSON>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> praised <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>'s economic growth. He also brought up the subject of human rights _ which he said he talks about `` wherever I go, unrequested'' _ although he did not directly criticize the <PERSON> Suharto </PERSON> government on the issue. Some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had asked <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> to find out the status of up to 400 political prisoners believed to be held in <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>. On Monday, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he met with three human rights activists in <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> and discussed legislation pending in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that would tie <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid levels to a country's human rights stance. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he `` rejected that categorically'' on grounds the legislation was a `` dumb idea.'' Also while in <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> repeated his support for <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> resistance leader Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, but added that a meeting between the two brought no changes in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy toward that country. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> was visiting <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> along with the leaders of two other factions hopeful of running <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> after the promised Vietnamese withdrawal. The fourth group vying for control in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> is the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, a Chinese-backed organization that was responsible for killing as many as 1.5 million Cambodians from 1975 to 1979. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have said they will not tolerate a Cambodian government dominated by the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s Vietnamese-installed government has changed the country's name and flag, and invited <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> to return home and help rule. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> welcomed the concessions, saying, `` We are going to make progress on the way toward a settlement.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is considering giving military aid to <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> and possibly the other non-communist <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> faction, headed by <PERSON> Son </PERSON> <PERSON> Sann </PERSON>. But he said such aid did not come up in his discussions with <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> flies to <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> for two days and will visit a refugee camp where Cambodians live along the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> border. He returns to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Friday and will stop in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> to monitor the cleanup efforts following the March 24 <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> oil spill in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>.

 <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> would lose at least five medical institutions and some universities under a budget proposal drawn up after voters rejected Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>'s tax plan, a top budget official says. More closures will be disclosed in the next two weeks, Commissioner of Administration <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Stine </PERSON> said Monday. On Saturday, voters rejected <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>'s tax revision plan that would have offset much of a projected deficit of abut $ 700 million for the new fiscal year beginning July 1. `` The cuts will be deeper than I wanted, deeper than common sense, but we will not do business as usual,'' <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> said Monday. The governor was referring to the projecting oil prices high enough to balance the budget on paper, a routine practice before he took office in March 1988. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> has blamed such practices for building up an accumulated $ 900 million deficit that the state covered with a bond issue last year. Each increase of $ 1 a barrel in the price of oil yields around $ 28 million a year in extra state tax revenue. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> said the state realistically could increase the projection from $ 15 to $ 17 per barrel because the price of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> oil is about $ 18, `` but you're only talking about $ 60 million if we do that.'' Having oil companies and other businesses pay a big share of state revenues dates back to the days of populist Gov. <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON> in the 1920s and 1930s. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>'s plan would have shifted the tax burden away from big business, put more of a load on individuals through the income tax and cut sales taxes. <PERSON> Stine </PERSON>, who heads the day-to-day operations of government, said the state must lay off a minimum of 3,000 employees. That would be in addition to 4,100 jobs that had been planned to go through attrition and layoffs even if the tax package had passed, he said. <PERSON> Stine </PERSON>'s office issued a report detailing $ 74.5 million in proposed cuts through the elimination of state programs. The budget calls for 33 of the state's 41 vocational-trade schools to be shut down, said <PERSON> Stine </PERSON>. Some universities must be closed or a majority of them changed from four-year institutions to two-year community colleges, he said. The state now has 18 public universities. `` We could end up with six four-year universities,'' said <PERSON> Stine </PERSON>. With higher education contributing $ 113 million to the deficit, `` I think you can expect some closures,'' said <PERSON> Stine </PERSON>. `` We're not ready to name them.'' Two of the state's eight charity hospitals must be closed, <PERSON> Stine </PERSON> said. Medicaid patients would be transferred to private hospitals and indigents without Medicaid would be transferred to other charity hospitals, he said. Also slated for closure is a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> nursing home for older handicapped patients and homes in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Leesville </LOCATION> for physically handicapped children. Those patients would be transferred to other facilities, <PERSON> Stine </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Stine </PERSON>'s report also said another $ 74.5 million would be saved by eliminating a 7 percent pay raise planned this fall for teachers, while $ 14.3 million would be garnered by denying state employees merit pay hikes. `` All options are on the table,'' said <PERSON> Stine </PERSON>. `` We are trying to do the best we can within the means available.''

<HEAD>Mother Who Used Cocaine Before Giving Birth Is Guilty Of Abuse</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCKFORD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A woman who used cocaine hours before giving birth was convicted of prenatal child abuse and neglect by a judge who compared the drug use to giving a baby razor blades to play with in the crib. `` This is the first case of this kind to come before this court,'' Juvenile Court Judge <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kapala </PERSON> said Monday in finding the mother guilty. The child was put in the care of social workers pending a May 25 hearing. A key element in the case involved the question of whether <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> law covers fetal rights, including the possibility of future health damage to so-called cocaine babies. The mother's attorney, <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Altamore </PERSON>, said the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> juvenile court act defines abuse and neglect of minors, but `` does not address the issue of fetus abuse.'' <PERSON> Kapala </PERSON> said <PERSON> Altamore </PERSON> raised a `` legitimate argument'' because state child abuse laws only speak of `` minors under the age of 21.'' But he said: `` I have to take a stand one way or the other on the issue'' of fetus rights. `` We can expect to see a growing body of law on this subject,'' he said. <PERSON> Altamore </PERSON> said the case could open the door to child abuse and neglect charges being filed against pregnant women who drink alcohol or smoke. But <PERSON> Kapala </PERSON> said there's a difference with cocaine, since it's illegal The baby, born three months ago, has shown no signs of addiction or serious health problems associated with cocaine babies, according to testimony. Assistant State's Attorney <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Golian </PERSON> said medical studies suggest cocaine babies may be subject to serious health problems far into the future. The judge said effects of the cocaine on the baby `` may not appear for years.'' But `` it's the same as if a mother gave a child a pack of razor blades to play with in the crib,'' he said. `` The child might drop the blades out of the crib and not get hurt, but the exposure to danger is the same.'' <PERSON> Kapala </PERSON> delayed a decision on whether the child eventually can be returned to the mother. She has been participating in a drug treatment program. Because it is a juvenile case, neither the woman's name was not released.

<HEAD>Kids Nationwide Tune In To $7 Million Science Project</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A popular robot was relegated to the sidelines, but thousands of excited schoolchildren still watched in awe as a $ 7 million science project lit up screens nationwide, whisking viewers to the bottom of the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. The satellite-relayed view from a camera-equipped submersible robot Monday was the first of two weeks of live broadcasts to an expected 250,000 students at 13 museums from <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. The project suffered a temporary setback last week when <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>, the 7-foot long robot whose older brother first explored the sunken Titanic, sank among the ruins of an ancient Roman trading ship off the coast of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. The cable used to lower the million-dollar submersible and its mobile garage, Argo, snapped and the pair plunged 2,100 feet to the soft, silty ocean floor. The robot was recovered apparently undamaged Saturday, but sat out the first 40-minute broadcast Monday. The biggest laugh of the morning came when <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON>, a grade school student from <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, had a chance to question Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON>, the head of the expedition. `` Is <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> all right?'' he asked, his voice crackling over a 3,000-mile connection to the support ship, Star Hercules. `` <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> is fine,'' <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> told his student audience via the two-way hookup. `` His pride's a little hurt, but luckily none of his instrumentation is.'' <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> sought to reassure the students, who have through weeks of lessons and classroom discussion developed an affection for the little propeller-driven robot explorer. <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> can be remotely driven in and around underwater objects. Its replacement Monday, <PERSON> Medea </PERSON>, is merely a sophisticated camera platform that is towed to the ocean floor. Broadcasting from his control center on the bridge, <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> took questions from students at three of the 13 participating museums, narrated live footage of underwater volcanoes and set the stage for pre-prepared films on satellite technology and the ancient Greek voyager <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>, for whom the 20th century robot was named. For some of the kids, the show was n't quite the same without its star. `` The teachers said it was going to be so real that it would seem like the water could come right off the screen,'' said 10-year-old <PERSON> Almas </PERSON> <PERSON> Rathod </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Shrewsbury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. `` It was n't like that.'' But classmate <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyall </PERSON> said the field trip had lived up to his expectations. `` It's much more interesting than hearing about it in a classroom,'' the 9-year-old native of <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> said. `` It was the next best thing to being there.'' The project, whose sponsors include <ORGANIZATION> Woods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION>, was scheduled to move 120 miles southwest next week, where it will broadcast from the site of a 2,000-year-old Roman trading ship.

<HEAD>Government Sets Reward in Search for Anti-Apartheid Activist's Killer</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Police offered a $ 4,000 reward today for information about the killing of a prominent white anti-apartheid activist and the country's law and order minister said he was horrified by the murder. Expressions of sorrow and outrage over the death of university professor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> came from both blacks and whites, and from anti-apartheid, academic, labor and student groups across <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, who worked with <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> in several organizations opposed to race-segregation, told hundreds of mourners Monday night at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witwatersrand </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, `` There is only one group that stood to gain from this act: those who are dedicated to perpetuating the brutal and vicious system that <PERSON> David </PERSON> dedicated his life to opposing.'' White musician <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Clegg </PERSON>, whose Zulu-style music has gained international acceptance despite a cultural boycott against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, sent a message of support to the meeting from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>, 44, an anthropology lecturer at <LOCATION> Witwatersrand </LOCATION>, was shot to death outside his <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> home Monday by an assailant firing from a passing car. Colleagues said they had no doubt he was killed because of his political activities. He was a prominent opponent of detention without trial. Several dozen black activists have been murdered in recent years. Many white activists have received anonymous threats or have been harassed by vandals, but few have been attacked. Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> said in a statement: `` I want to make it clear on behalf of the government that the murder is strongly condemned and that no stone will be left unturned to apprehend those responsible.'' Tributes to <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> came from a wide range of organizations opposed broadly to apartheid and specifically to various policies of the white-led government. The groups assist families of detainees, keep records of alleged human rights abuses, object to military conscription and contest eviction of blacks from rented houses. A spokesman for the Southern African <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>'s life `` was one of great respect for the human dignity of all people.'' <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Naidoo </PERSON>, general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> African Trade Unions, said the killing `` is a blow to our struggle but it will only strengthen our determination to uproot and destroy apartheid evils.'' The Detainees Parents Support Committee, banned by the government, said <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> became an authority on forms of state repression and also patterns of informal repression. `` His work went a long way to exposing those acting under the cover of darkness,'' a statement said. Under apartheid, the country's 28 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

<TEXT>
 Nine anti-abortion activists have been ordered to pay more than $ 800,000 in damages to a doctor who said he and his family suffered mental anguish because of demonstrations outside their home. `` I believe in the right to picket, and I am an advocate of the First Amendment to the Constitution,'' Dr. <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said after Monday's 10-2 jury verdict. `` But anyone who abuses those rights should be penalized.'' <PERSON> Cliff </PERSON> <PERSON> Zarsky </PERSON>, one of two lawyers who represented the nine defendants without a fee, said he will move for a new trial, and if that fails, he will appeal the verdict. Jurors ruled that the peaceful protests caused mental anguish to <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, his wife, Mercedes, and their four children. The damages included $ 140,000 in past and future suffering of the couple and $ 170,000 in past and future suffering of the four children. A half million dollars in punitive damages was awarded for gross negligence in picketing the family home. State District Judge <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> scheduled a hearing today on whether to issue a permanent injunction against future picketing by the defendants. `` I feel my family will be left alone now,'' <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said. His wife said she was `` very much relieved'' as she wiped away tears. The trial ended at a time when the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is considering a case that could cause it to reconsider its 1973 ruling, <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, that women have a constitutional right to end their pregnancies. The question before the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is a dispute over a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> law that limits abortions in that state. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said he has been performing abortions since 1978 and anti-abortionists had picketed his office since 1982. They began picketing at his home in March 1988, the month he filed his lawsuit. He testified that his wife suffered from depression and ulcers, that one son had been institutionalized and that his three school-age children suffered academically after the picketing began at his home.

<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A skinhead has pleaded guilty to murder in the slaying of a black man whose head was struck so hard with a baseball bat that the bat split. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mieske </PERSON>, 23, who went by the nicknames `` Ken Death'' and `` Batman,'' entered the plea Monday in the slaying of <PERSON> Mulugeta </PERSON> <PERSON> Seraw </PERSON>, 27, an Ethiopian national. <PERSON> Mieske </PERSON> said he and others killed <PERSON> Seraw </PERSON> on Nov. 13 `` because of his race.'' <PERSON> Mieske </PERSON> also pleaded no contest to racial intimidation in the non-fatal stabbing of a black security guard at a supermarket last September. Prosecutors plan to seek a life sentence with a mandatory minimum term of 20 years on the murder conviction, according to a plea agreement between <PERSON> Mieske </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Multnomah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> District Attorney's office. <PERSON> Mieske </PERSON> agreed not to challenge the sentence. `` This sends a very strong message to anyone who wants to commit racist crimes in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, and we hope that never happens again,'' said Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frink </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> `` I do n't think we could have gotten anything better if we'd gone to trial.'' <ORGANIZATION> Multnomah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> set sentencing for June 5. <PERSON> Mieske </PERSON> was to have gone to trial May 8. His lawyer, <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogt </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Mieske </PERSON> agreed to plead guilty partly because federal authorities were threatening to prosecute him for civil rights offenses that could have resulted in a life sentence with no parole. <PERSON> Mieske </PERSON> could have been prosecuted in federal court even if he'd gone to trial and been convicted on the state charges, <PERSON> Vogt </PERSON> said Under the plea agreement, federal authorities wo n't prosecute <PERSON> Mieske </PERSON> if he accepts the sentencing recommendation, the attorney said. <PERSON> Kyle </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brewster </PERSON>, 19, and <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Strasser </PERSON>, 20, are still awaiting trial in <PERSON> Seraw </PERSON>'s death. They are charged with murder, assault and racial intimidation. <PERSON> Seraw </PERSON> was beaten to death outside his southeast <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> apartment after two fellow Ethiopians brought him home from a party. According to police testimony, <PERSON> Mieske </PERSON> hit <PERSON> Seraw </PERSON> in the back of the head with a baseball bat three times, fracturing <PERSON> Seraw </PERSON>'s skull and splitting the bat. <PERSON> Mieske </PERSON> wore his hair short in the skinhead style. Some, but not all, skinheads are racists. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Herndon </PERSON>, a community leader who attended Monday's hearing on behalf of <PERSON> Seraw </PERSON>'s family, called the plea bargain fair, but was uncertain whether it would help deter racist violence by `` sick people.'' `` I ca n't predict insanity,'' <PERSON> Herndon </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Opening Arguments in Giant Clam Caper</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM KLAHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Seven people poached nearly $ 2 million worth of giant clams by underreporting harvests and evading state fisheries agents, a prosecutor claimed. In opening statements Monday, Assistant prosecutor <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Brenneman </PERSON> said the `` defendants routinely took thousands of pounds of state resources'' from Puget Sound without paying for them. But an attorney for one of the defendants said the trial was the result of a bitter feud between those who dominated the geoduck clam industry and resentful divers recruited by the state to build its case. `` You're going to hear two very different stories on this industry,'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said. Opening arguments were expected to resume today. The so-called <PERSON> Clamscam </PERSON> trial, one of the biggest white-collar crime cases in the state's history, centers on the evolution of the geoduck industry, which did not exist until 1970. The geoduck, pronounced `` gooey-duck'' after an Indian word for `` dig deep,'' has a long, sinuous neck, an oblong shell up to six inches long and weighs as much as 10 pounds. The mollusk is harvested in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, much of it for export to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> where its flesh can bring $ 12 a pound. The defendants were officers, suppliers and associates of the now-defunct <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and related companies. They are accused of stealing at least $ 1.8 million worth of clams from state-managed clam beds. Ms. <PERSON> Brenneman </PERSON> said testimony would show that <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodgson </PERSON>, 52, the company's co-owner, in the early 1970s conspired to underreport the amount of clams harvested to state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> officials. Also charged was <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kondo </PERSON>, 58, who came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in the 1950s and was a pioneer in the harvesting of geoducks along with <PERSON> Hodgson </PERSON>. The two were the first to discover a market in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> after a trip there in 1975. Besides falsifying harvest figures, <PERSON> Brenneman </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Hodgson </PERSON> directed divers to go outside legal clamming areas for the desirable white-necked clams and to share information on how to evade authorities. <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, an attorney for <PERSON> Hodgson </PERSON>, told jurors the 1.2 million pounds of clams allegedly stolen over a span of 10 years actually was just 5.1 percent of the entitled harvest within that time. He also said the divers the state will call to testify for the most part were angry with the pay given them by <PERSON> Hodgson </PERSON>, and that the divers had done the poaching. Also charged were <PERSON> Kondo </PERSON>'s daugher, <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rommel </PERSON>, 28; <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearce </PERSON>, 37, a former employee of King Clam; fisherman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>; bookkeeper <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>; and <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Hondle </PERSON>, who was aboard <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>' boat when it was seized in 1986. All seven defendants were charged with first-degree theft and conspiracy to commit trafficking of stolen property.

 Nazi Holocaust survivor <PERSON> Leah </PERSON> <PERSON> Zonershein </PERSON> choked back tears today as she read aloud the names of her parents, <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hannah </PERSON>, who perished in a World War II concentration camp. She was one of hundreds of people who took part in memorials throughout the country at which names of the 6 million Jewish victims were being read on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s national day of mourning for the Holocaust. Sirens sounded at 10 a.m. throughout the country. Thousands of Israelis paid tribute by halting traffic or stopping in their tracks and bowing their heads for the two-minute wail of the sirens. Polish-born Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, who lost family in the Holocaust, was expected to read names later today at Parliament in keeping with this year's theme of personal remembrance. Names also were read aloud at army bases, schools and following prayers at <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION>'s holiest shrine, the Western Wall, the remnant of the ancient Jewish temple in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s walled <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The Dutch-born Mrs. <PERSON> Zonershein </PERSON>, 62, said the ceremony at <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> helped ease memories of her ordeal. `` I have found that talking about it helps,'' she said. Her sister, <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Ilan </PERSON>, stood at her side at the microphone but could not speak. `` I still am unable to let it all out,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Ilan </PERSON> said afterward. The sisters spent 15 months in the <LOCATION> Bergen-Belsen </LOCATION> concentration camp in occupied <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, where their parents died. The women were freed by Soviet troops in April 1945 after a forced `` death march'' by <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> soldiers who fled the Allied invasion. `` I do n't know how we went on to live normal lives after what happened. Somehow life wins out over everything,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Zonershein </PERSON>, a retired teacher. Several elderly survivors wept as they pronounced names of brothers, sisters and cousins who died. Difficult as it was, most survivors agreed the readings were an effective way to keep the memories alive for young Israelis, now two generations removed from the Holocaust. `` Holocaust day became a routine thing here. The number, 6 million, says nothing to most people, but name after name after name, that gets the message across,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Zonershein </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s outdoor <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Yehuda </PERSON> shopping mall, hundreds of vendors and shoppers paused to bow their heads in tribute when the siren rang out for Holocaust Martyrs and Heroes Rememberance Day. They included Orthodox Jews who read from the Torah and a Palestinian in an Arab keffiyeh headdress who bowed his head in silence. To many Israelis, the Holocaust has become a symbol of Jewish suffering that also reflects their security fears amid continued Arab enmity. `` This is a very important show of respect and an act of remembering because it could happen again,'' <PERSON> Devora </PERSON> <PERSON> Feinstein </PERSON>, 17, said after the collective silence. Another name-reader at <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> was Lithuanian-born <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> speaker <PERSON> Dov </PERSON> <PERSON> Shilansky </PERSON>, a survivor of <LOCATION> Dachau </LOCATION> concentration camp in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, who lost aunts, uncles and grandparents to the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>. `` Now we have our own Jewish state, with our own parliament and I am speaker as a remnant of your flesh,'' <PERSON> Shilansky </PERSON> said in a brief speech after laying a wreath of flowers by a stand of memorial torches. <PERSON> Shilansky </PERSON> criticized the construction of a Roman Catholic convent just outside the former <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> death camp. `` In <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> they have built a kind of monument to your graves, a Carmelite convent with a big cross.'' The church agreed to move the convent in 1987, but the agreement has not been implemented. Holocaust day is timed by law in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to fall half way between the start of a 1943 Jewish uprising against German troops in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and Israeli Independence Day, which this year is on May 10.

 Tens of thousands of Solidarity supporters shouted `` Down with communism!'' and turned a May Day march into a rally for union-backed candidates in the coming <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> elections. `` We have been walking to this rally for eight years, but we finally made it,'' said <PERSON> Maciej </PERSON> <PERSON> Jankowski </PERSON>, a Solidarity activist from <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` Today has shown how many we are, but we ca n't just be strong on holidays.'' Like the Solidarity supporters reveling in their movement's reinstatement after a seven-year ban and government concessions including a promise of free elections, thousands of workers around the world gathered Monday on the international labor day to celebrate gains or demonstrate for change The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> held a traditional parade through Red Square, and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leaders used speeches and editorials to urge social stablility in the face of student protests for democratic reforms. But in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, rallies became riots. Police also clashed with demonstrators in two Polish cities as well as in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. Up to 100,000 union supporters filled a field at the foot of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> to hear city Solidarity leader <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Bujak </PERSON> present the union movement's candidates for the June elections to the Sejm, the lower house of parliament, and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Popular actor <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Lapicki </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION> candidate, drew a roar of approval when he said: `` I am sure in voting for me, you are voting for Solidarity.'' But, he added, `` If you do n't vote out of laziness, you are making the Communists happy.'' Authorities scaled back official celebrations. <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> told about 20,000 loyalists gathered at Victory Square that socialism was returning to its `` purest values'' thanks to party-backed reforms. Party officials also organized meetings at cafes in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> where citizens could discuss politics and the battered economy with government officials. Before the Solidarity rally, about 30,000 people sang and chanted as they marched through <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> to the waves and smiles of onlookers who gathered in windows and on balconies. Solidarity, banned after the martial-law crackdown in December 1981, was legalized April 5 under an agreement in which authorities agreed to at least partially share power with the opposition in the first such arrangement in the Soviet bloc. In at least two cities, police used force to break up rallies by militant Solidarity splinter groups. Police attacked protesters in the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> and used tear gas and clubs against stone-throwing youths in the southern city of <LOCATION> Wroclaw </LOCATION>, activists said. Riot police in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> fired tear gas in a battle with about 5,000 striking workers in <LOCATION> Masan </LOCATION> and nearby <LOCATION> Changwon </LOCATION> after protesters tried to stage a May Day rally, police said. About 200 workers were arrested. In the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, police swung truncheons and fired tear gas to break up crowds marching to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> after a rally in which union leaders threatened a nationwide strike to press for a higher minimum wage. In <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, at least 76 people were arrested for taking part in anti-government protests during the official May Day parade in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. Reporter <PERSON> Misha </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenny </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said he was punched in the face and held for five hours as he recorded an arrest in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said it would protest to <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. In the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, an activist in the Soviet republic of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> said residents in the capital, <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, defied a ban and held a large, peaceful rally. May Day celebrations were banned in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, because of recent pro-independence unrest in the cities. The mood was festive in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> under sunny skies during the traditional May Day parade through Red Square. Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and other officials stood atop <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>'s tomb as thousands of marchers waved colorful banners, pushed floats and floated balloons.

 The leader of a longshoremen's union says his members might stop unloading ships from drug-producing countries, as members of the cargo industry work out a plan to fight trafficking in illegal drugs. `` We'd rather lose wages than lose our children,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowers </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Longshoreman </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday. <PERSON> Bowers </PERSON>' statement came Monday as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs Commissioner <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> announced a proposed agreement by Customs, air lines and sea carriers and unions to combat drug trafficking. None of the carriers had signed the agreement Monday. `` This is the first time that industry, labor and government have joined together to put together a plan to combat drug smuggling,'' <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said before a meeting with representatives of about 100 air and sea carriers where the plan was outlined. The agreement _ still in draft form _ calls for carriers to impose strict security standards at foreign and domestic docks, terminals and facilities and aboard their planes and ships. <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said on `` CBS This Morning'' today that `` one thing we've started to do very effectively is to deal with the pilots that use small airplanes and the guys that use small speedboats -LRB- to smuggle drugs -RRB-.'' `` They're really losing that war, as it were, so the theater of war is shifting to commercial cargo,'' he added. `` That will be the last theater of this war. It'll be a tough one, but with the help of the shipping companies, the airline companies and labor, all together, we're going to win it. It's just going to take time.'' The ILA's <PERSON> Bowers </PERSON> swore that his membership _ 110,000 from `` <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'' _ would help out. `` I told the commissioner we'll have 110,000 pairs of eyes out there looking to help him,'' he said. He noted that the longshoremen had refused for 25 years to unload cargo from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and recently paid $ 9 million in fines because the union lost a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision over the boycott. <PERSON> Bowers </PERSON> declined to say whether any country's cargo or ships already had been targeted for a possible boycott or what criteria the union would use to refuse to unload ships. <PERSON> Bowers </PERSON> assured the sea carriers' representatives that he would make sure there would be swift and sure, if rough, justice for any union member found helping drug traffickers. `` If we take him down there, you wo n't need a court for him,'' <PERSON> Bowers </PERSON> said. `` Anything with my people, I'll make sure they never work on the waterfront again.'' Some of the carriers' representatives wanted a tariff imposed that would cover their costs for the new security measures the agreement would demand so they would remain competitive with carriers that do n't participate. <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Razzino </PERSON>, the Customs program manager for narcotics interdiction in commercial cargo, said such a decision would have to be made by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. As part of the agreement, Customs will provide security training, surveys of foreign and domestic sites and help in identifying potential smuggling opportunities. If a carrier is found to be carrying illegal drugs, Customs will weigh the company's degree of general compliance before deciding on a penalty. Under the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, penalties for carrying illegal drugs went up to $ 1,000 per ounce of heroin and cocaine and $ 500 per ounce of marijuana. The act also authorized the seizure of the carrier. `` If you help us prevent drugs from getting aboard your conveyance, you'll have no problems with penalties and seizures,'' <PERSON> Razzino </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> estimated that 30 percent of the cocaine now entering the country is coming in by shipping container, and said he expected that to increase to 50 percent in the next two years and up to 80 percent to 90 percent by 1992 because of a crackdown on other forms of trafficking.

 Electricity flowed into Atlantis today, beginning a new countdown toward a Thursday afternoon blastoff after crews fixed fuel system problems that caused a last-minute launch postponement. The shuttle is to carry into space five astronauts who are to propel a robot spacecraft to explore the planet <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>. The countdown began on time at 8 a.m. when a test director summoned the launch team to work stations. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said the new launch plan was `` optimistic,'' but officials were confident enough to move ahead. Liftoff was scheduled for 1:48 p.m. Thursday, with the 64-minute launch opportunity extending until 2:52 p.m. The countdown, which normally lasts more than three days, is being compressed by 24 hours this time by eliminating some work done in the first count that need not be repeated. The astronauts, who had returned to their training base in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> after the scrub, were to fly back here late today after a practice session in a shuttle simulator. Commanding the mission is <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>. The pilot is <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Grabe </PERSON> and the mission specialists are <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleave </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Thagard </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> is the only one who has not flown a previous shuttle flight. Scientists monitoring the <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> spacecraft in Atlantis' cargo bay reported it was healthy. The astronauts are to release the $ 550 million probe toward <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> to map the planet's cloud-veiled surface. The two bad parts that forced Friday's postponement were a hydrogen fuel pump that short-circuited and a 4-inch-diameter fuel line that sprung a small leak. Small metal particles found in the pump may have caused the short-circuit, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said. The speedy fashion in which the parts were replaced prompted the agency to set a Thursday launch date. Officials had said Sunday they did not expect to be able to try again before Friday. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiley </PERSON>, deputy director of engineering at the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, credited the repair crew. `` This is a very dedicated team here,'' he said. `` When the chips are down they really get out and hustle. They did a bang-up job.'' The delay meant a loss of valuable days in starting <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> on its voyage. Because of the shifting positions of <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>, there is only a 32-day period when the spacecraft can be launched toward <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s sister planet. If the shuttle ca n't get off the ground by May 28, the mission would have to be put off two years, at a cost of more than $ 100 million, until the two planets are again properly aligned.

 It still may be living in sin, but unrelated people can live together throughout <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> after <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> revoked a law that had caused years of controversy and forced some to carry marriage certificates. The council late Monday voted 7-6 to abolish the law that had covered more than half the city. `` There are no longer any zoning districts where two people can not live together,'' said Councilwoman <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, who worked to change the ordinance since she was first elected in 1975. `` I'm delighted.'' Councilwoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> DeGroot </PERSON> also voted to abolish the law. `` Zoning, I believe, should be used to determine land use and density but not relationships,'' she said. Supporters of the law argued that revoking it could hurt family values. `` The family is the fundamental structure that preserves our society,'' said Councilman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>. The vote is a `` step toward destroying our city,'' said Councilman <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Hackworth </PERSON>. Councilman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Crider </PERSON> called the passage `` a sad day in the city of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>.'' The living-in-sin law had covered about 60 percent of the area of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, which has a population of more than 500,000. Under the law, neither boarders nor unrelated people were allowed to live in the same house in areas zoned R-0. In areas zoned R-1, a homeowner was required to obtain a $ 20 boarder's permit to cover a non-relative `` After reviewing the sales prices and the square footage of the homes, there did not appear to be a significant difference between an R-1 and an R-0 in my district, `` <PERSON> DeGroot </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Donohue </PERSON>, another supporter of change on the council, said the law forced people to carry their marriage certificates with them, and zoning inspectors complained about having to count toothbrushes in homes. <PERSON> Donohue </PERSON> said some neighborhood arguments turned nasty and people were forced to move after being turned in to authorities. The penalty for violating the ordinance was $ 999 a day. People had six months to appeal but when told they faced a fine for every day of violation, most sold their houses, often at a considerable loss because of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>'s soft housing market, <PERSON> Donohue </PERSON> said. Several churches turned out previously to oppose any change to the law, but most opposition this time came from families and a real estate agent, who sold houses based on the zoning restrictions.

<TEXT>
 The government should develop trade relations with the Soviet bloc as a counter to punitive economic sanctions imposed by Western countries, state radio said today. The South African <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> commentary also diverged from previous government statements by depicting the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s presence in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> as legitimate and permanent It was one of the most explicit expressions of a major new development in South African foreign policy, triggered by the diplomatic initiatives of Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s tactics have forced <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> to revise its decades-old view of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> as an arch enemy orchestrating black nationalist guerrillas in a `` total onslaught'' to overthrow <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s white-dominated government. In recent months, the two countries have found a common interest in seeking to keep an independence plan for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> on track. South African officials also have been pleased by Soviet statements that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> seeks peaceful change in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> appears to have accepted that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is the regional power in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' the radio said. `` <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, for her part, must accept that although <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> is not a traditional sphere of influence for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, she has been allowed by other governments in the region to establish a presence that is a permanent presence.'' Because of this, the commentary said, `` a certain degree of interaction is consequently inevitable and, in certain areas, could be fruitful.'' `` Trade relations with Eastern Bloc nations can be expanded without <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> diluting her firm and longstanding resistance to the inhumanity of communism,'' it said. `` Diversified trading relations are all the more important given the hostile action of Western nations such as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in instituting economic sanctions.'' Last week, there was an official Soviet visit to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> for the first time since the countries broke diplomatic ties in 1956. Soviet diplomat <PERSON> Viacheslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Ustinov </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, Angolan and <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> officials to assess accords calling for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to end its rule of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> to withdraw troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ustinov </PERSON> emphasized that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> will not consider restoring relations with <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> until it dismantles its policy of legal race discrimination and grants political rights to the black majority. The radio said: `` As a Christian nation, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, in turn, must condemn the oppression of religious and ethnic minorities under the communist system ... `` This having been said,'' it added, `` there are certain realities that have to be taken into account.''

<HEAD>Cambodian Refugee Camp Shelled In Thailand</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Shells crashed into the largest <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> refugee camp in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> today, the latest in a recent surge in border assaults, Western relief officials said. Three rounds flew over camp known as Site 2, striking a road, and two shells landed in the camp 30 minutes later, said <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Velde </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Border Relief Operation. No casualties were reported. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Velde </PERSON> said that in the past 10 days, 15 shells or rockets have landed in or around Site 2. Three seriously wounded refugees were sent to the hospital of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> official said. `` We are concerned by the repeated instances of shelling of civilian encampments and appeal to concerned parties to refrain from harming innocent civilians,'' <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Velde </PERSON> said. Site 2 houses about 180,000 refugees. It is in <LOCATION> Prachinburi </LOCATION> province, near the border with <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, and about 50 miles north of the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> border town of <LOCATION> Aranyaprathet </LOCATION>. The camp is controlled by the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, one of three guerrilla groups fighting the forces of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and of the government it installed in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> after invading in late 1978. It is not clear who is responsible for the recent shellings, which have forced the temporary evacuation of all but the most essential relief personnel. `` Whoever is doing the shelling, the aim is clear. They want to disrupt the relief services, they want to disrupt normal life in the camp,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity. Some officials theorized the pro-Vietnamese Cambodian forces were shelling the camp to pressure the refugees to abandon the resistance and return to <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. Others theorized that the guerrillas were doing it to convince the world they needed more weapons to defend the camp. In the past, shellings of the border camps also have escalated as the two sides maneuvered diplomatically. Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, leader of the resistance coalition, has been holding talks in <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> this week with <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>, premier of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has said it will withdraw its forces by the end of September. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s three-party resistance coalition includes the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, which was blamed for killing hundreds of thousands of people when it ruled <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> from 1975 until <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s invasion.

 House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s use of the Congressional Record to plug a home video product made by his wife's employer follows a long Capitol Hill tradition: Just about anything can be printed, and is, at taxpayers' expense. For more than 100 years the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Record </ORGANIZATION> has provided an uncritical compilation of remarks said _ and unsaid _ by members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. It is printed five days a week, every week, and runs 200 or so pages on average. It costs $ 18 million a year, and is produced by more than 500 government printers working through the night. `` It's like producing the <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, five times a week,'' said <PERSON> Duane </PERSON> <PERSON> Nystrom </PERSON>, editor for the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is not a small project.'' The embattled speaker, already fighting allegations he violated <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics rules, was the object of fresh reports Monday in The Wall Street Journal about remarks he had included in the Congressional Record of Dec. 9, 1985. His 350-word statement amounted to an effusive endorsement of the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>'s series of video motivational programs designed to enhance family togetherness and conversation. `` Marvelously useful,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> gushed. And available `` at a nominal price within the range of most American families.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> did n't mention the $ 36,000 a year annual salary that the company was paying his wife, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON>. Her job with another company is the basis for some of the ethics charges now facing the speaker. The Seattle-based <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said it did n't ask for <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s remarks. But it reprinted them later in promoting sales of the tapes at $ 34.95 each or $ 400 for a full set of 21. The revelation ca n't help <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> in the fight for his political future, but no one is suggesting this is the first the time Congressional Record provided an official-looking plug. Nor is it the first embarrassment involving the Record. Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, can vouch for that. In 1986, <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> inserted into the Record a legal brief filed by a group opposing `` dial-a-porn'' telephone services, Citizens for Decency Through Law. That issue of the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Record </ORGANIZATION> became a bestseller. Included in the brief, and printed in the record, was the full, X-rated text of one of the tapes. `` Hi, I'm <PERSON> Nellie </PERSON> from High Society,'' it began. Both episodes were possible because of the way the Record is edited. It is n't. Or at least, it is n't edited for content. Copy is edited for errors and grammar, but little else, said <PERSON> Nystrom </PERSON>. `` There is virtually no censorship of comments put on the record,'' he said. `` The only thing that would be excised from the record would be obscenities.'' Content, he said, is governed by the rules of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The Record prints what is said on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, and members are free to submit additional statements. Remarks that violate the rules, such as attacks on another member, would be edited out. In an effort to make the Record more faithfully reflect what was said, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> a few years ago decided to have remarks that were edited or added later appear in a different typeface. But inserts can be as lengthy as a member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> wants. Much of the Pentagon Papers, for example, was included. The Record is printed through the night and available the next morning, and it is also available electronically by computer. It has a press run of 24,000 copies, and <PERSON> Nystrom </PERSON> figures it costs about $ 500 per page to print. Congressional rules generally bar members from receiving benefits as a result of improperly exerting their position, and guidelines caution lawmakers against becoming so `` affiliated with a particular enterprise'' that it creates an appearance of impropriety. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> declined to answer questions Monday about his video plug. But <PERSON> Nystrom </PERSON> says he doubts <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s use of the Record was unique. `` If there was something wrong with that, every member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would be guilty of doing that,'' he said. `` Everyone ... uses the Record to promote or call attention to some activity within their district. `` I would see it as a matter of degrees,'' he said.

Two of the three long-running comedy shows in which Miss Ball starred, `` The Lucy Show'' and `` Here's <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON>,'' aired Monday nights on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, while `` I Love Lucy'' had starting times on Monday and other days as well. Miss <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> died Wednesday of a ruptured aorta, eight days after having heart surgery at <ORGANIZATION> Cedars-Sinai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> arap </PERSON> <PERSON> Moi </PERSON> has replaced his vice president in a shake-up that leaves <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s major tribe out of the government's top two jobs for the first time since independence. <PERSON> Moi </PERSON> named <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Saitoti </PERSON>, the finance minister and a former professor of mathematics at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nairobi </ORGANIZATION>, as the country's sixth vice president since this former British colony won black rule 25 years ago. He replaces <PERSON> Josephat </PERSON> <PERSON> Karanja </PERSON>, who resigned as vice president and vice chairman of the ruling party after receiving a unanimous vote of no confidence from <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Saitoti </PERSON> retains the finance portfolio. The change leaves both the presidency and vice presidency occupied for the first time by men who are not members of the dominant Kikuyu tribe. <PERSON> Karanja </PERSON> is a Kikuyu, but his successor calls himself a Masai, a tribe of largely nomadic cattle herders. <PERSON> Moi </PERSON>, the country's second president since independence, is a member of the small <LOCATION> Kalenjin </LOCATION> tribe. <PERSON> Moi </PERSON>, who had been expected to dismiss <PERSON> Karanja </PERSON> if he did not voluntarily step down after the parliamentary vote, announced the changes Monday evening. They included reshuffling the portfolios of nine ministers, abolishing one <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> post and creating a new one. Thursday's vote of no confidence came after nearly two months of attacks on the vice president. They began with a relatively low-level politician telling a village gathering that `` an unnamed politician'' had been ursurping the authority of the president. From then on, accounts of verbal attacks on `` an unnamed politician'' appeared almost daily in <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION>'s three English-language newspapers. Speculation quickly centered on <PERSON> Karanja </PERSON> who, it was said, arrogantly forced others to kneel before him and was appealing to tribal animosities. But it was not until two weeks ago that <PERSON> Karanja </PERSON> finally was identified by his detractors. Through it all, <PERSON> Moi </PERSON> kept silent, leading to widespread speculation that he sanctioned or even orchestrated the attacks. <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, by law, is a one-party state and opposition is firmly suppressed. In announcing his resignation, <PERSON> Karanja </PERSON> again denied the allegations against him, which included charges of corrupt business practices and receiving money from neighboring <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION> to destabilize the government. Most other Cabinet changes were minor. But <PERSON> Moi </PERSON> scrapped the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guidance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> and created a new <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reclamation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arid </ORGANIZATION>, Semi-Arid and Waste Land.

 Jury deliberations at <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s Iran-Contra trial resumed for the 10th day this morning, a day after the presiding judge said a court challenge by the news media threatens the proceedings The panel, which had met for nearly 46 hours in the nine previous sessions, has given <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> no notes in a week. While the nine women and three men went about their work Monday, attention in the courtroom focused on a dispute in which 10 news organizations want access to a trial document that summarizes highly secret intelligence intercepts of a CIA-assisted shipment of Hawk missiles to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The government says national security would be jeopardized by disclosing the stipulation, which is part of the evidence before the jury, and <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> says the matter could force a mistrial. It is highly unusual to supply documents to the jury which are not part of the public record in the case. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> has already ruled against releasing the document, and Monday's proceedings were designed to create a record so that an appeals court court review his decision. `` If you prevail in this matter,'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> told a lawyer for the 10 news organizations, `` one possibility is I must discharge the jury.'' The judge did not elaborate on how forced disclosure could lead to the mistrial. But one possibility might be a protest by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> that national security secrets were about to be disclosed. That would force <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> to withdraw the document from the jury's consideration, which in turn could lead <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers to say he could not get a fair trial After the court session, lawyer <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyk </PERSON> told reporters that `` the jury has no security clearance, the jury's free to discuss it, then the rest of the country ought to see what the jury has.'' Under the Classified Information Procedures Act, the government may file an affidavit with the court if it fears disclosure of a classified document would harm national security. That act can lead to dismissal of the indictment or the specific charge affected by the information. The stipulation of facts agreed to by the government and <PERSON> North </PERSON> summarizes messages intercepted by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> on the shipment of Hawk missiles in November 1985 from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> with the help of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>. North is charged with claiming in a false chronology that no one in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government knew until January 1986 about the missiles. Part of his defense is that then-CIA Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> and national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> knew about the missiles from the intercepted messages but perpetuated the false story. North also said former national security adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> orchestrated the false chronology. The news organizations' disclosure motion was rejected by <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> on April 22 on grounds that the stipulation `` is a classified document.'' The ruling was appealed and the higher court sent the matter back to <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> for a hearing on national security issues involved, saying it could not make a decision without having such a record. The media organizations involved in the case are The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cities-ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION>

<HEAD>Mother Charged Under Anti-Gang Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A woman who kept snapshots of her children posing with guns and whose son is accused in a gang rape is the first person charged under a new anti-gang law targeting parents who fail to control their children. <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, whose 15-year-old son is accused of raping a 12-year-old girl, was charged Monday under a misdemeanor law added to the books last year. She faces up to a year in jail and a $ 2,500 fine if convicted. `` Attacking the gang problem at its roots _ in the home and at an earlier age _ is crucial to battling this cancer in our society,'' City Attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> said. More than 350 people were killed in gang-related violence in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> last year. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> alleged that Ms. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> was `` actively involved in her son's gang.'' Ms. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 37, was arrested Friday at her home in south-central <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and was freed on $ 20,000 bail. Her son, a reputed gang member called <PERSON> Popeye </PERSON>, whose real name was not released, was arrested for investigation of the rape last month of the 12-year-old girl. The child told police she was raped by gang members at various `` safe houses'' over four days, <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> said. The son is on probation for auto theft and had previous arrests for investigation of burglary and receiving stolen property, police said. `` All I can say is that they are wrong. My son is not in a gang,'' Ms. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said Monday. `` The police keep putting this on him, but it is not true.'' Police who searched the <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> home found gang graffiti scrawled on walls. Two photograph albums portrayed Ms. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> with youths who wore gang clothing and flashed gang signs, <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> said. `` It looked like the headquarters for the local gang,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferber </PERSON> of the city attorney's gang unit. Other photographs showed the 15-year-old son with a rifle, a 4-year-old son pointing a pistol at the camera, and Ms. <PERSON> William </PERSON>'s 19-year-old daughter posing with an automatic pistol pointed at a child's head, police said Monday night, a reputed gang member was critically wounded by shots fired from a passing car, said police Sgt. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Heslop </PERSON>. Murder charges were filed Monday against a 15-year-old boy arrested in the shooting death last week of a 16-year-old boy, apparently killed because his blue cap matched the colors of a rival gang.

 Defense Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> exaggerated problems with the <ORGANIZATION> Sikorsky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> SH-60F when he scrapped plans to order 18 of the anti-submarine helicopters in the 1990 budget, says a congressman from the state where Sikorsky is headquartered. `` They were blown out of proportion,'' Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Conn </LOCATION>., said Monday `` There were really no big problems at all.'' <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION> last week cited operational problems in the two SH-60Fs already delivered by Sikorsky, the <LOCATION> Stratford </LOCATION>, Conn.-based division of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> did include funds to keep the program going until future purchases can be made But according to briefing papers the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> provided to <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, most of the problems either have been fixed or are being resolved. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said none of the failures pose a serious enough problem to prevent safe use. The problems included improper installation of a warning light and damaged sonar cables, according to the documents. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said the helicopter has `` no substantial design flaws.'' Sikorsky officials also were fixing problems discovered during the previous year's testing, including an overly sensitive automatic altitude control designed to keep the craft at 50 feet above the water. The system apparently forced the helicopter up and down with the motion of the waves below, according to <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON> aide <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boomer </PERSON>. The SH-60F is a modified version of Sikorsky's SH-60B Seahawk. The SH-60F, expected to replace the Sikorsky-built SH-3H, is made to be based on aircraft carriers for anti-submarine missions. The SH-60F lowers sonar equipment into the water and pulls it in search of enemy subs. Capt. <PERSON> Barton </PERSON> <PERSON> Strong </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s program manager, told <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON> in the private briefing Monday that the SH-60F was performing well and would be a significant improvement over the older SH-3H, according to the congressman. Strong assured <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON> that the Pentagon still supported the SH-60F program. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials told the congressman that the administration plans to buy a total of 175 SH-60F helicopters over 13 years. Seven were ordered in 1987 and 18 each in fiscal 1988 and 1989. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> plans to return to a request of 18 in 1991, then 12 a year through 1995, 17 in 1996, 24 in 1997 and 25 in 1998. The helicopters cost about $ 15.8 million each. The 1990 budget, which originally called for $ 313.6 million in SH-60F spending, was reduced by <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> to $ 94 million to cover spare parts and advanced procurement to keep the program alive. No SH-60Fs would be purchased in 1990 under <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>'s budget, but <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> still has to approve that plan.

<TEXT>
 Sales of new homes fell 5.5 percent in March and registered their first back-to-back declines in more than a year, the government said today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said sales of new single-family homes dropped to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 587,000 in March, following a 10.5 percent decrease during February. It was the first time sales had declined for two consecutive months since they fell for five months in a row from September 1987 through January 1988, the months surrounding the October stock market crash. The declines left sales in March at the slowest annual rate since the 576,000 level of January 1988. The report was another indication of the impact with which rising interest rates have hit the housing industry. Earlier reports on housing activity in March showed sales of existing homes declining for the third straight month and construction of new homes and apartments dropping for the second month in a row. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> for a year has been pushing up interest rates in an effort to restrain economic growth and thus reduce inflationary pressures. Fixed-rate home mortgages last week were averaging 11.03 percent, and lenders were asking an average initial rate of 9.38 percent on one-year adjustable rate mortgages, according to a national survey by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The biggest drop in new home sales in March was in the West, where sales dropped 20.5 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 155,000. Sales in March were down 12.7 percent in the South to an annual rate of 199,000 and declined 2.8 percent in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> to 105,000. Sales surged 43.3 percent in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> to a rate of 129,000 after plunging 26.9 percent during the previous month. The drop in sales was accompanied by a 4.7 percent increase in the median price of the homes sold, as lower-income buyers apparently were the first ones to leave the housing market. The March median price for a new home was $ 126,000, meaning half the homes sold for more and half for less. The average price, which is pulled up by sales of expensive homes, was up 4 percent to $ 152,200. For the first three months of the year, new home sales were 1.8 percent lower than in the same period a year earlier.

 President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> today urged <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> to rewrite the group's original charter so that it no longer calls for the destruction of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, a spokesman for the French president said. Jewish merchants in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>' garment district turned on their burglar alarms in unison today to protest <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s visit, which has caused outrage in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s Jewish community. A point frequently made by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is that despite the decision by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s parliament in exile, to recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and renounce terrorism, the organization's charter still calls for the Jewish state's destruction <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> chief to alter the charter. `` During the meeting, Mr. <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> noted that the continuation in force of the charter of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, adopted in 1964, was contrary to important points of the political program adopted by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> council </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> on Nov. 15, 1988, and that in his eyes things should be made clear,'' said a statement read by <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Vedrine </PERSON>. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> later met with several other <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> political figures, including <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Mauroy </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mauroy </PERSON> told reporters he also raised the article in the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> charter on the destruction of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. According to <PERSON> Mauroy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> replied that `` this text has existed for many years and is now outdated.'' <PERSON> Mauroy </PERSON> said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> reaffirmed the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and abandonment of terrorism <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, after the 90-minute meeting with <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, smiled and posed for photographers on the steps of the presidential palace. Urged to comment, he said only: `` It was a very successful and useful meeting.'' He added that all would be explained at a news conference Wednesday. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> on the day his personal representative and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s senior official in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Issam </PERSON> <PERSON> Salem </PERSON>, was shot and seriously wounded in an ambush in the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, police there said. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Salem </PERSON> died. The source of their information was not known, and there was no claim of responsibility for the attack. About 2,000 police, including sharpshooters and helicopter patrols, were mobilized for <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s visit, during which he also was to meet with Premier <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON>. <PERSON> Vedrine </PERSON> read the French statement about the meeting and said he would take no questions from reporters. The statement said <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> questioned <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> on his position concerning elections proposed by the Israeli government in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and expressed French concern `` about the serious present situation of the inhabitants of these territories. `` He indicated to Mr. <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> that <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> would continue to act with all interested parties so that an international conference on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> can be held under the terms which he himself -LRB- <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> -RRB- has already suggested,'' the statement concluded. Israeli leaders were critical of the visit. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said: `` This man says a lot of things to the Jewish people. ... He's following the same tradition of the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>.'' Today is <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s national day of mourning for the 6 million Jewish victims of the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> during World War II. In the Jewish-dominated garment district in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, Jewish manufacturers and shopkeepers set off their burglar alarms and private car alarms for five minutes to protest <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s visit. `` It is ridiculous to officialize <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> before getting any guarantees,'' said protester <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Gotajner </PERSON>, a clothing manufacturer. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s Jewish community is largely opposed to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s visit and planned a demonstration today at the Copernic synagogue where a bomb in October 1980 killed four people. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> began talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> in December for the first time since in 13 years after <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said he recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist and renounced terrorism.

 One of the engines of a Saudi Arabian jumbo jet exploded today while it was flying with 293 people from <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION>, airport officials said.

<TEXT>
 Christian army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said today he would consider lifting a blockade of illegal ports run by Syrian-backed Moslem militias to end an eight-week conflict that has killed 278 people. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> made the offer in a 90-minute news conference a few hours after fierce shelling duels today between Christian and Syrian gunners in and around <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> killed two people and wounded eight. `` The ports are no longer the basic issue,'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said at the presidential palace in suburban <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION>, east of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. `` Syrian military presence in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> is the issue.'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said he might lift the blockade after talks with <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> representative <PERSON> Lakhdar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahimi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, who was due in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> Wednesday to try to salvage a shaky 4-day-old cease-fire mediated by the league. <PERSON> Ibrahimi </PERSON> had been scheduled to arrive today but postponed his arrival, according to sources in <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. Today's casualties raised the overall toll to 278 people killed and 1,010 wounded since March 8, when fighting broke out between <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> army units and an alliance of Syrian and Druse forces. A police spokesman said Syrian gunners targeted the coastal strip north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and prevented the French tanker Penhors from approaching the power station in the suburb of <LOCATION> Zouk </LOCATION> to unload fuel oil. The barrage damaged the main power cable connecting the Zouk plant with <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and stripped the capital of its daily two-hour ration of electricity, said the police spokesman, who can not be named under standing rules. The Christian voice of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> radio blamed the cease-fire violation on Syrian gunners and said <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s troops `` responded in self-defense.'' Voice of the People, radio of the pro-Syrian <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, blamed <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> for the renewed fighting. `` <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s gunners started the barrage,'' the radio said without elaboration. The thuds of exploding shells echoed across <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and the flashes of artillery explosions lighted up the dark skies. Most civilians deserted their apartments and sought refuge in underground shelters. The police spokesman said there was almost no traffic in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> as the warring factions traded sniper fire and rocket-propelled grenades across the Green Line that divides the Christian and Moslem sectors. `` It seems most civilians have decided to remain in basements and bomb shelters pending the outcome of <PERSON> Ibrahimi </PERSON>'s mission,'' the spokesman said. <PERSON> Ibrahimi </PERSON> was to meet Wednesday with acting Premier <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, head of the Moslem Cabinet in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s dual government and complete arrangements for the deployment of Arab military observers to oversee a new truce. An aide to <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ibrahimi </PERSON> and the Sunni Moslem leader will discuss a compromise to the sticking point of the truce _ <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s blockade of ports run by Syrian-backed militias south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> The compromise calls for the deployment of Arab observers at the ports to `` guarantee that they are not used for illegal activities,'' said the aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The aide said it was <PERSON> Ibrahimi </PERSON>'s responsibility to convince Druse warlord <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON> and Shiite Moslem leader <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> to accept the proposed solution. <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> militia operates a single-dock harbor in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s fishermen's suburb of <LOCATION> Ouzai </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> runs two facilities at <LOCATION> Khaldeh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jiyeh </LOCATION> south of the capital. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> on March 6 blockaded the three facilities that deny the state treasury of about $ 100 million in lost customs dues annually. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> also said the ports were used to `` smuggle drugs and terrorism.'' <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>'s forces responded to <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s blockade by shelling the 310-square-mile Christian enclave northeast of the capital. Syrian gunners later joined in the fighting, but <PERSON> Amal </PERSON> did not take part. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and other Christian leaders accuse the Syrians of failing to achieve a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> by siding with the Moslems in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year-old civil war.

 Emperor <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> and his mother, the empress dowager, will be the only heirs of the late Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> in order to keep together the royal treasures, news reports said today. <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Household </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> asked nine other imperial successors to waive their rights of inheritance. The palace declined comment, however, saying a public announcement now would be premature. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s emperor for 62 years, died Jan. 7 at age 87. <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON>, his eldest son, succeeded him and <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Nagako </PERSON>, became empress dowager. Under Japanese law, legal heirs to property must claim their inheritance within six months of the owner's death. This would mean by July 7 in <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s case, and the tax administration office must announce the claims within four months. It will be the first public accounting of the imperial family's private finances since shortly after World War II The government reported then that the imperial family's wealth amounted to the equivalent of about $ 113,000. Such things as three sacred treasures _ a mirror, sword and jewels handed down from emperor to emperor _ are tax-exempt, and the family owns no land. But bank savings, stocks and bonds under <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s name and paintings are subject to inheritance taxes. <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> said the palace will donate the art works to the government and continue to use them as government-owned imperial property. The land where the imperial family lives is owned by the government. The imperial family, formerly exempt from taxes, was the wealthiest family in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> until <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces occupying this country after the war forced it to give up most of its property. Its wealth, including real estate, stocks and bonds, reportedly amounted to about $ 29 million before it surrendered most of its holdings to the government.

<HEAD>Trial Begins of Man Accused of Killing Sons in Hot Foundry Ladle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MUSKEGON, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Jury selection began today in the trial of a man accused of killing his two sons in a red-hot foundry ladle on Thanksgiving Day 1987. <LOCATION> Muskegon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Circuit Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Graves </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> rejected a motion by an attorney for defendant <PERSON> Bartley </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Dobben </PERSON> for a non-jury trial. <PERSON> Dobben </PERSON>, 28, who has been diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic, has been shuffled among the state's psychiatric centers since his arrest on Nov. 26, 1987. On that day, <PERSON> Dobben </PERSON>, his wife, <PERSON> Susan </PERSON>, and their children, 2-year-old <PERSON> Bartley </PERSON> and 15-month-old <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>, were on their way to a family Thanksgiving dinner when <PERSON> Dobben </PERSON> pulled into the parking lot of the <ORGANIZATION> Cannon-Muskegon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> foundry where he worked in <LOCATION> Norton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shores </LOCATION>. He left his pregnant wife in the car, telling her he wanted to retrieve a Bible and show his sons the operation. Minutes later, <PERSON> Dobben </PERSON> allegedly placed the boys in a huge foundry ladle used to hold molten metal and turned on the gas jets until the ladle reached 1,300 degrees. The boys quickly suffocated as the ladle became a searing cauldron, autopsies showed. <PERSON> Dobben </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON>, contends his client should be found innocent by reason of insanity. <PERSON> Brett </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, an assistant <LOCATION> Muskegon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutor, says ample evidence exists to show <PERSON> Dobben </PERSON> was criminally responsible for the slayings. <PERSON> Dobben </PERSON> has a long history of mental illness. Court records show that family members had him committed to the <ORGANIZATION> Kalamazoo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> because they were frightened by his actions. A September 1985 probate court order said <PERSON> Dobben </PERSON> could be `` reasonably expected within the near future to intentionally or unintentionally seriously injure -LRB- him -RRB- self or others.'' Those suffering from paranoid schizophrenia live in a fantasy world and may have hallucinations or false perceptions and hear voices, psychiatrists say. After his release from the hospital, <PERSON> Dobben </PERSON> was given prescriptions for powerful drugs to control his behavior. But family members said he often refused to take them, especially after his religious views moved increasingly out of the mainstream. He began to associate with a small fundamentalist group called <ORGANIZATION> Emmanuel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fellowship </ORGANIZATION>, led by <PERSON> Rood </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaughan </PERSON>, an unordained preacher and used car salesman. <PERSON> Vaughan </PERSON>, who was to be called as a witness, checked himself into the <ORGANIZATION> Kalamazoo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> Saturday, one day after police said he attacked his mother. She suffered a sprained wrist in the altercation. It is n't known how <PERSON> Vaughan </PERSON>'s hospitalization might affect <PERSON> Dobben </PERSON>'s trial, which has been postponed several times as psychiatrists debated the defendant's competency.

 A 15-year-old boy has been arrested in the rape of a 2-year-old girl, who was taken from a playground, attacked inside an abandoned building and then dumped in a trash bin, police said. The toddler remained hospitalized in stable condition today, said Sgt. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON>, a police spokesman. He said no details on the girl's identity and injuries would be released. Police also withheld the suspect's identity because he is a juvenile.

Police said the girl apparently was carried from a playground and sexually assaulted Sunday in a vacant house, one of many in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> neighborhood. `` We've been calling about these ... houses,'' said resident <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Goddard </PERSON>, complaining about a lack of response by city officials. `` They told us a lie that they would get them down in three months. `` It made me feel so bad I wanted to hurt somebody.'' <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, 30, and <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 37, found the girl in the trash bin Sunday afternoon as they returned from a store. `` We heard something howling.

<HEAD>Bush to Decide on Soviet Grain Subsidies, Dole Said</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was deciding today whether to approve a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> subsidized sale of 3 million tons of grain to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, top congressional Republicans said. Senate Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not indicate which way he was leaning during a breakfast meeting with <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> leaders, but that the lawmakers strongly advised him to go ahead with the deal. It would be <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s first approval of a major agricultural subsidy. The sale has been the subject of intense disagreement both within the administration and in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> told reporters after the meeting that several lawmakers made `` strong pitches'' to the president on behalf of the sale, `` the point being, if we're going to trade with <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which we are, then we have to be competitive, we have to meet world prices.'' `` We made our case to the president,'' said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, whose state is a leading grain producer. `` I think there was general agreement among those this morning that if we're going to be in this trade game, we've got to be competitive. The subsidy's not very great in this case, probably not as much as the storage costs.'' The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, following the lead of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, has called for eventual elimination of all export subsidies. It has said, however, that it would not unilaterally do away with such government farm support so long as other trading nations subsidized their exports. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and other participants said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> indicated he would make up his mind on the subsidies later today, amid reports that the president might decide on partial subsidies for the grain sales. The administration is divided on the proposed grain sale, with the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> supporting it and the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> reportedly opposing it. The sale would be made under a 1985 law, the Export Enhancement Program, under which nations that buy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural goods receive bonus quantities of commodities from government stockpiles.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has proposed that <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> make unilateral cuts in its short-range nuclear weapons in an effort to bridge sharp divisions in the Western alliance over the missiles, a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> official said today. Under the proposal, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would be challenged to meet the lower levels of the 16-nation <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The weapons would be trimmed as part of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> plans to modernize the aging Lance surface-to-surface missile, a project that has sparked opposition in many European countries. Further cuts in nuclear arms would be considered after progress was made in recently opened arms talks in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> on slashing conventional, or non-nuclear, forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the official said. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official confirmed the account but said it was one of several options under consideration. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said another option would be <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> resuming research and development of a non-nuclear missile that could attack airfields and other targets now covered by the <PERSON> Lance </PERSON>. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where the Lance launchers are based, last month demanded early talks with the Soviets on reducing short-range nuclear weapons. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> strongly oppose the idea. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ideas, put forward last week to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> representatives in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, could serve as elements of a possible way to resolve the issue prior to a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit May 29-30. The <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> official described the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> plan `` as a proposal for a working document for how to proceed on the issue. It does n't offer any compromise with the German proposal. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> officials have been trying to find satisfactory language on the weapons issue to include in a long-awaited blueprint of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s strategy in arms control and force planning that is to be presented at the summit A senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official suggested last month that <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> may fail to resolve the differences over the short-range weapons. He raised the possibility that the alliance would not reach a common position in time for the summit. Such an outcome would likely lead to speculation about serious divisions in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. The Western nations are trying to present a united front in the face of defense cuts promised by Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> official said the American plan draws together several ideas that have been put forward in the alliance. It would take reductions proposed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s supreme military commander in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, in a recent study of his nuclear weapons requirements and challenge the Soviets to meet the lower levels. <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> has pressed for <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> to agree to upgrade the Lance missile, arguing its modernization would permit a substantial reduction in nuclear artillery. The Lance missile was introduced in 1972 and will become obsolete in 1995, military analysts say. It has a range of a little more than 60 miles. The new one would be extended to more than 250 miles, just under the limits of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty. Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> said earlier in the year that a decision to deploy the new missiles should be delayed until 1991 or 1992, which would be after elections next year in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> defense ministers, at a nuclear strategy session last month, gave only lukewarm backing to the modernization program, saying nuclear forces `` must be kept up-to-date where necessary.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Defense Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said he was satisfied with the endorsement and was `` reasonably confident'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would provide more money to continue development of the new generation <PERSON> Lance </PERSON>. There are currently 88 Lance launchers, most of which are based in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Officials have said the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> outnumbers <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> by about 12-to-1 in short-range nuclear missile launchers. The alliance contends it needs to maintain its nuclear stockpile to balance the enormous superiority the East has built up in conventional arms. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the seven <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact countries began talks in March on cutting conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.

The arrests occurred after men with an ax handle cornered a white youngster who was not involved, the mayor said. Three black men, including the Rev. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, were charged with disorderly conduct. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said he responded to a call from his nephew, who had been arrested at the drive-in, `` and I wound up being arrested, too.'' <PERSON> Smitherman </PERSON> promised Monday to try to prevent a recurrence. `` I do n't object to the Confederate flag flying over the Capitol or behind <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Selma </LOCATION>, but when somebody tries to use it to stir up trouble, it's coming down,'' <PERSON> Smitherman </PERSON> said.

 Eleven tugboats on Tuesday began towing a $ 2.4 billion oil platform as tall as a 95-story building from a <LOCATION> Norwegian </LOCATION> fiord into the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, the state oil company said. It will take six days to tow the 956-foot high Gullfaks C platform the 154 miles to the oil and gas field of the same name, according to <ORGANIZATION> Statoil </ORGANIZATION>, which operates the field. `` Gullfaks C is the largest and heaviest structure that man has ever moved,'' the state oil company said. The 49,000-ton deck combines a 330-bed housing unit with drilling and production facilities. It covers about four acres of water. The 24 hollow, concrete cells in the base store 2 million barrels of oil. Production from the platform was scheduled to start in November with a 245,000 barrel daily capacity. The Gullfaks field, which was discovered in 1978, produces 300,000 barrels of oil daily. Production began in December 1986, and an estimated 31 million barrels of recoverable oil remain, the <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said.

 A bomb today wrecked a new monument in <LOCATION> Volta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Redona </LOCATION> honoring three striking steelworkers who were killed by army troops, officials said. No injuries were reported in the predawn blast.

The monument was unveiled Monday during Labor Day commemorations in <LOCATION> Volta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Redonda </LOCATION>, a town 80 miles west of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today called for all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies to condemn anticipated massive election fraud in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, where the administration predicts <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> will steal Sunday's vote. `` All nations that value democracy _ that understand free and fair elections are the very heart of their democratic system _ should speak out against election fraud in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in remarks to the Council of the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION>, an organization of business people. `` That means the democracies of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, as well as nations in this hemisphere struggling to preserve the democratic systems they've fought so hard to put in place.'' In a speech touching on the economic, political and social situation throughout the hemisphere, the president also said that unless <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist government changes the `` ominous'' actions leading to its elections next February, `` It will be a tragic setback _ and a dangerous one. The consolidation of tyranny will not be peace. It will be a crisis waiting to happen.'' He said <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>, where Monday's elections led to victory for Gen. <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, `` is on its way to joining the democratic mainstream.'' `` We congratulate President-elect <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> on his electoral victory and look forward to working with him,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. However, White House spokesman <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> later told reporters there were `` several instances of questionable but not illegal procedures'' in the Paraguayan elections. `` There were also administrative problems,'' according to embassy and international observers, he said, but not a pattern of overall fraud. `` The small number of votes affected by these irregularities would not make a significant difference in the overall election results,'' in which <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> got 70 percent of the vote, <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> continued to step up the adminstration's anti-Noriega rhetoric as the Panamanian election nears. He repeated his promise that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` will not recognize the results of a fraudulent election engineered to keep <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in power.'' The government, controlled by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, is backing the general's close associate, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Duque </PERSON>, for president An opposition coalition is backing <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said it took `` great courage'' for the opposition to enter the campaign. `` A free and fair vote in the elections,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, would enable <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> `` to take a significant step towards ending the international isolation and internal economic crisis brought on by the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> regime.'' But, added <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, `` It is evident that the regime is ready to resort to massive election fraud in order to remain in power.'' In <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, where the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is supplying non-lethal aid to the Contra rebels until the elections next year, the president blasted the election laws recently passed by the Sandinista-controlled national assembly. He accused the Sandinistas of imposing a `` stacked deck'' against their opposition, by unilaterally setting the rules, giving excessive enforcement powers to the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, and barring private ownership of television stations. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> praised the recent elections in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and said the new president, <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, `` has our support.''

 <PERSON> Issam </PERSON> <PERSON> Salem </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s senior official in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, was shot and seriously wounded today in an ambush in this southern port city, police said. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> initially said <PERSON> Salem </PERSON> was killed in the attack. But late in the day, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> told reporters he understood <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> was in a coma in intensive care. `` We must not let ourselves be terrorized by this incident,'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, 25 miles south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, police said <PERSON> Salem </PERSON> was driving along <LOCATION> Fakhreddin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> when masked gunmen raked his car with gunfire at 1:05 p.m. `` <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> is wounded in the head. His chances of survival are very slim,'' said a police spokesman who can not be identified under standing rules. <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> was rushed to <ORGANIZATION> Hammoud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> and was undergoing surgery, the spokesman said, adding police had no clue to the identity or motive of the gunmen. On Saturday, <PERSON> Zeid </PERSON> <PERSON> Wehbi </PERSON>, the official spokesman in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> for <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla faction, escaped assassination when a rocket-propelled grenade was fired at his <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> home. Two passers-by were wounded by shrapnel in the attack, but <PERSON> Wehbi </PERSON> was not home at the time, police said. There was no claim of responsibility for the attack today or the attack on <LOCATION> Wehbi </LOCATION>. In the French capital, where <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> met with President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> official said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman had been told of the attack on <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION>, his personal representative in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` Mr. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> knows.

A senior <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> official, without making specific accusations of responsibility, said the two attacks were evidently part of an organized plot. `` The rapid succession of the two attempts indicates an organized intelligence apparatus was out to eliminate <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s men,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s third-largest city, is the base of an estimated 5,000 <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas who have filtered back to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> after the 1982 evacuation of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> following the Israeli invasion. <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> is married to <PERSON> Jihad </PERSON> <PERSON> Salameh </PERSON>, a sister of the late <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Salameh </PERSON>, the chief of <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s personal security apparatus who was assassinated by a remote-controlled bomb in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in 1979.

 A truck carrying military explosives overturned on <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> 20 just outside this <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> town, and police closed the highway and briefly ordered evacuations before learning the explosives were not armed. Local authorities said the truck carried 48 rocket pods containing 644 M-77 grenades and a quantity of rocket fuel, but there was no explosion and no fire. Explosives experts from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sill </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hood </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> inspected the accident site and determined there was no danger, said officials at the scene from the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dyess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>. The authorities decided to have the explosives loaded onto trucks for transfer to <LOCATION> Dyess </LOCATION>, where they were to be examined further. The accident occurred about two miles east of <LOCATION> Sweetwater </LOCATION>, a town of almost 13,000 people about 40 miles west of <LOCATION> Dyess </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Abilene </LOCATION> and 170 miles west of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>. A seven-mile stretch of the highway, the main east-west route in north-central <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, was closed in both directions and traffic was rerouted into the afternoon. <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, the driver of the truck, said a deer crossed his path as he drove down the interstate. `` All I know is a saw a deer and I swerved to miss it,'' said <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, of <PERSON> Fouke </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, who was treated at a hospital for minor injuries and released. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s passenger, his father, <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, was not injured in the accident. An evacuation order was issued for all residents within 3,000 feet of the accident scene, but the order was later lifted after an investigator entered the truck and determined the explosives were not armed, said <ORGANIZATION> DPS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>. `` People are being allowed back in the area.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, who has flown the equivalent of the distance between the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION> and more than halfway back, broke another barrier Tuesday by becoming the first supersonic pontiff. Like the seasoned traveler that he is, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> took it in stride, quietly reading a book about animal behavior as the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France </ORGANIZATION> jetliner flashed across the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> toward <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> at 1,350 mph _ twice the speed of sound. `` He's showing mild curiousity,'' said <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> as the needle-nosed Concorde carried the pope from the French island of Reunion to <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, on the third leg of his four-nation nine-day pilgrimage. The chief cabin steward said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> read during his two hours and 34 minutes aboard, but he also took time out to learn some details of the 1,920-mile flight. `` He was very interested, he asked us about the speed and the altitude,'' said the steward, who declined to give his name. The crew served 1983 vintage Perrier-Jouet champagne, but the pope opted for mineral water and orange juice. `` He said he had a long day ahead of him, and he wanted to keep a clear head,'' the steward said, adding that the pontiff only picked at lunch of goose liver pate with truffles, lobster in Sauterne sauce, potatoes, rice creole, cheeses and lemon meringue dessert. The Concorde left Reunion and rocketed out over the ocean at a speed of 225 mph in 30 seconds.

 The high price a <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> casino owner paid for throwing a party on <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s birthday has revived the question: Why do n't casino employees have the same constitutional rights as everyone else? <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Engelstad </PERSON>, owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palace </ORGANIZATION>, agreed in February to pay a $ 1.5 million fine after the <ORGANIZATION> Nevada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gaming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> ruled that a party he held at the hotel-casino on April 20, 1988, disgraced <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>'s gambling industry. `` This was just a good excuse to have a party for the family, as he calls the employees at his hotel,'' said <PERSON> Engelstad </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickerson </PERSON>, who maintains that the private party celebrated the restoration of a World War II truck in <LOCATION> Engelstad </LOCATION>'s historic vehicle collection. Commissioners dropped claims of damaging <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>'s reputation in the <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> party case and of destroying evidence in an unrelated case after <PERSON> Engelstad </PERSON> agreed to pay one of the highest fines ever levied by the casino regulators. Officials said the party featured a picture of <LOCATION> Engelstad </LOCATION> in a Nazi uniform and bartenders in T-shirts bearing <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s picture and the label `` <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> _ European Tour 1939-45.'' <ORGANIZATION> Gaming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> lawyer <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Shearer </PERSON> said the fine was appropriate because <PERSON> Engelstad </PERSON> damaged the reputation of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dickerson </PERSON> said fining his client clearly violated <PERSON> Engelstad </PERSON>'s First Amendment right to free expression But <PERSON> Dickerson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Engelstad </PERSON> made a `` pragmatic business decision'' not to take the matter to court. <PERSON> Dickerson </PERSON> joins a growing group of lawyers and civil liberties activists who contend that the state tramples the rights of casino owners and workers in its zeal to protect the image of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>'s largest industry <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> law says gaming is vital to the state and its continued growth depends upon public trust that can be maintained only by strict regulation. Under that policy, the state can deny or limit a casino operator's license. Grounds for denying or revoking a license or levying a fine include such obvious violations as cheating players or skimming profits. Other grounds include a criminal background, associations with criminals, lack of integrity or lack of business sense. `` They'll do whatever they want to do until some court tells them they ca n't do it,'' said lawyer <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>. The Las Vegas attorney in 1979 won a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that commissioners could n't order a casino worker to apply for a license after he left the gambling division of a hotel and became entertainment manager. <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> complained that a rule letting commissioners punish licensees for `` associating with ... persons of notorious or unsavory reputation'' forces aspiring casino operators to give up rights to free association. `` Every day these folks when they appear before the commission for licensing they arewilling to ... say, ` Give me my license and I wo n't talk to buddies I've known all my life and had into my home and broken bread with,''' said <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>. Gaming Commission Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON> said a gaming license is a privilege, not a right. `` There is a balancing process any time you have a case where a person's constitutional rights guarantee the right to free expression, as opposed to whether that person is doing something inconsistent with maintaining the privilege to operate in the gaming industry,'' he said. <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON> said commissioners have guaranteed constitutional protections to license holders, including freedom of association. `` I think what has to be looked at is the degree of association and the significance of association,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has often ruled it has no power over <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> casinos because gambling is n't an interstate industry. <PERSON> Shelley </PERSON> <PERSON> Chase </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said the group has n't opposed any state gaming rules. But she said the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> believes it could successfully challenge many as too sweeping. `` This is a heavily regulated industry, and gaming is certainly a privileged industry,'' she said. `` However, we are worried about laws that are arbitrary, capricious and vague. And these laws are certainly vague. Especially the one which says you may not bring disrepute on the state. What does that mean _ what you wear?'' Ms. <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> officials were surprised that <PERSON> Dickerson </PERSON> did n't approach them for help, because <PERSON> Engelstad </PERSON> could claim added legal protection since he lives at the Imperial Palace, where the party took place. `` What you do in your own residence is your own business,'' she said.

Because Hungarians do not require visas to visit <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, millions have taken advantange of the new regulations to travel regularly. The work begun today to dismantle the fence on <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s 220-mile border with <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> is to be completed by Dec. 1, 1990 The fence, an electronic alarm system which is about a mile from the actual border, once was used to help prevent Hungarians from escaping to the West.

<DATELINE>WENDOVER, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The famous Bonneville Salt Flats, the dry, hard-packed lakebed where thrill seekers for decades have gone to set world land speed records, are losing salt, and the government wants to know why. The 100-square-mile area of smooth, uninterrupted surface, where even jet-powered cars can run flat out for miles, has been shrinking 1 percent a year for 28 years, said <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> Manager <PERSON> Deane </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeller </PERSON>. `` Given this long-term trend, it's apparent that the Salt Flats, as we know them today, are in trouble. Clearly, some hard questions need to be addressed,'' he said in a statement Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION> is asking state agencies, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Survey </ORGANIZATION>, racing interests and a potash company to join in a three-year, $ 330,000 study of what can be done. <PERSON> Zeller </PERSON> said that while other salt flats exist in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, none are of the quality and accessibility of the Bonneville Salt Flats. The <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION> has the backing of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Timing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the study. The group, organizer of the largest of the annual speed trials held on the salt, has complained for years about deterioration of the racing surface. Many suspect a <LOCATION> Wendover </LOCATION> company's practice of draining brine from land adjacent to the flats to recover potash. But <ORGANIZATION> Reilly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> denies responsibility for any deterioration and maintains there is no hard evidence of an overall salt loss.

<HEAD>Post Office Faces Financial Crunch</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is facing a financial crunch, with revenues running short of what was expected following last year's rate increase, Postmaster General <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said Tuesday. The mail service still expects to finish this fiscal year in the black, but with a significantly smaller margin than had been planned, officials said. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> told the agency's governing board that changes must be made to hold down costs and improve revenues. So far in the fiscal year, which began in October, the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> took in $ 18.5 billion and spent $ 17.6 billion, leaving net revenues of $ 847 million, reported Senior Assistant Postmaster General <PERSON> Comer </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Coppie </PERSON>. But that was $ 104 million less than expected in the wake of the postal rate increase that took effect in April 1988. Because it is required by law to break even over the long run, the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> counts on showing a surplus in the period right after a rate hike, in order to balance losses which will occur as its costs rise. Lately, rate hikes have come every three years and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> has said he hopes to maintain that cycle, with the next increase in 1991. Income has been less than expected because of changes in the `` mix'' of mail, said <PERSON> Coppie </PERSON>. In other words, many large mailers have switched from more costly first class mail to the pre-sorted first or third class, which costs them less and brings in less revenue for the post office. While managers expected some of this switch, it has occurred faster than they expected with the resulting decline in revenue, said <PERSON> Coppie </PERSON>. At the same time, continuing efforts to cut costs have not been as successful as had been hoped for, he added. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> told the postal <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION> that he is continuing to press forward with automation of the postal system as a means of cutting costs and speeding delivery. Also, he said he is trying to improve employee relations and is looking for ways to broaden product lines and make prices more competitive. The Postal Service can not change its domestic rates without seeking approval from the independent <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, an agency which <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> criticized for micromanaging his service in changing some rates requested a year ago. The Postal Service is free to revise international rates, and recently did so, cutting the price of a half-pound interntional express mail shipment to $ 10.75, with an introductory rate of $ 8.75 to try to attract new business. Depending on destination, the price had ranged from $ 15 to $ 18.

 Female alligators that have no qualms about going for a romantic tumble in the wilds are having trouble breeding behind bars.

Reproduction in farm alligators is only 10 percent to 20 percent as effective as in the wild, where females produce about 22 hatchlings each, he said. <PERSON> Cardeilhac </PERSON>, who has studied reproductive problems in captive alligators for nearly a decade, made alligator-breeding history in 1981 when 11 healthy baby gators hatched as the result of fertilization by his artificial insemination technique.

<HEAD>New-Home Sales Down for Second Straight Month</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government reported Tuesday that sales of new homes dropped 5.5 percent in March after plunging 10.5 percent in February, as higher interest rates took their toll in the housing market. It was the first time sales of new single-family homes had posted back-to-back declines since they fell five times in a row in the months surrounding the October 1987 stock market crash. The new declines left sales at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 587,000 in March, the lowest level since the 576,000 pace of January 1988, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported. Earlier reports on activity elsewhere in the housing sector also pointed downward in March, as interest rates on fixed-rate mortgages hovered around the 11 percent mark, more than a percentage point above levels of a year earlier. The other reports showed that sales of existing homes dropped for the third straight month in March and that construction of new homes and apartments was down for the second month in a row. `` As long as mortgage rates stay high or move a little higher, the housing market is not likely to improve much,'' said economist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Berson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` Any improvement in housing will almost certainly have to come from a decline in mortgage rates.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> for a year has been pushing interest rates upward in an effort to slow economic growth and thus restrain inflationary pressures. Housing has been among the sectors of the economy most affected, and some analysts believe further declines in sales and construction are likely. `` We expect further weakening in the second and third quarters of the year, and then hopefully a rebound beginning late in the year,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Seiders </PERSON>, chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Builders </ORGANIZATION>. The association is forecasting new-home sales of 616,000 for all of 1989, down 8.9 percent from last year. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON>, chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION>, said that interest rates are near their peak and that the high rates `` have taken as big a toll as will be taken on the housing market.'' `` When rates start to come down, the people who have been forced out of the market will come off the sidelines,'' he said. The March decline in sales reflected decreases in most regions of the country and occurred despite a 43.3 percent sales surge in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, where sales rose to an annual rate of 129,000. Analysts said the Northeast gain was a rebound from a 26.9 percent decline in that region during the previous month. The biggest drop in March was in the West, where sales dropped 20.5 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 155,000 units. Sales were down 12.7 percent in the South to an annual rate of 199,000 and declined 2.8 percent in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> to 105,000. The shift in sales activity to the higher-priced Northeast and the dropoff in the less expensive South contributed to a 4.7 percent increase in the median price of homes sold in March. The March median price for a new home was a record $ 126,000, meaning half the homes sold for more and half for less. The average price, which is pulled up by sales of expensive homes, was up 4 percent to a record $ 152,200. For the first three months of the year, new-home sales were 1.8 percent lower than for the same period a year earlier.

 <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> ambassador said Tuesday his landlocked country will continue expanding its relations with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and might complain to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> about economic pressure from its other big neighbor, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s month-long cutoff of necessities to <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> causes great human hardship and threatens the stability of <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>, said ambassador <PERSON> Mohan </PERSON> <PERSON> Man </PERSON> <PERSON> Sainju </PERSON>. Nevertheless, he told an audience at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, his nation is still `` open to any dialogue, any approach suggested by <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'' for solving the crisis. <PERSON> Sainju </PERSON> described as `` beyond comprehension'' statements by Indian External Affairs Minister P.V. <PERSON> Narasimha </PERSON> <PERSON> Rao </PERSON> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> ambassador that there is no economic blockade and <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> has itself to blame for reduced supplies of necessities such as oil, baby food, salt and medicine Petroleum shipments have been held up since March 23, a week before <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> declared that a treaty with <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> had lapsed, he said. <PERSON> Sainju </PERSON> also said that the Nepalese finance minister, B.B. <PERSON> Pradhan </PERSON>, plans `` to talk about a long-term arrangement with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'' on economic matters. <PERSON> Pradhan </PERSON> is in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> for meetings of the <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and the Nepal-China joint economic commission. If Nepalese policy openings to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> upset <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, let <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> say so openly, <PERSON> Sainju </PERSON> suggested. <PERSON> Rao </PERSON>, in a long report to the <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> last week about relations with <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>, did not mention <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>'s recent arms purchases or other contacts with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>AIDS Crisis Broadens Support For Sex Education</HEAD>

 The AIDS crisis has generated nationwide support for sex education but taken attention away from other important sexual topics like pregnancy prevention, according to a survey released Tuesday. `` Support for sex education is strong. Not only does a large majority of the American public support it, but so do most state education agencies and large school districts,'' concluded the study, `` Risk and Responsibility: <ORGANIZATION> Teaching </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Schools Today.'' But the report found that of the nearly $ 6.3 million states spent in 1987-88 on sex education curricula, $ 5.1 million was specifically for AIDS instruction. Forty states either support or require sex education, said the study by the <ORGANIZATION> Alan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guttmacher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Jeannie </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosoff </PERSON>, president of the institute, said that states `` have abdicated their role in sex education'' by giving districts only vague guidelines on how to teach it and by not setting teacher certification standards. The study also found that nearly one third of sex education teachers said their biggest problem was pressure from parents, the community or administrators, especially when dealing with homosexuality, condoms or abortion. The $ 323,000 study, funded primarily by the <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, examined teaching policies and methods in grades 7-12. The findings were published in `` Family Planning Perspectives,'' a bi-monthly publication of the <ORGANIZATION> Guttmacher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a private, nonprofit research group that studies reproductive health. The study consisted of three nationwide mailed surveys conducted in the spring of 1988. One polled 4,241 of the estimated 50,000 public school teachers who teach sex education. A second surveyed all 50 state education departments and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> regarding sex education laws, policies and curricula. The third asked similar questions of 162 large school districts. It concluded that the `` crisis orientation'' created by AIDS has led educators to stress `` the negative outcomes of sex'' while often neglecting other important issues. In only six states _ <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> _ are condoms discussed explicitly. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s curriculum discusses where condoms can be bought and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s suggests ways of teaching students how to use them. Five other states _ <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> _ discuss condoms but in a negative light, usually stressing the failure rate. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s curriculum extols abstinence as `` freedom from the bother and dangers of the pill, IUD and other contraceptives.'' The curricula `` leave something to be desired in terms of balance,'' said <PERSON> Asta </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenney </PERSON>, a co-author of the study. Eight out of 10 teachers surveyed said they could use help in teaching about pregnancy prevention and sexually transmitted diseases. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said the study demonstrates the need for better teacher training. `` Our public schools must provide teachers with the necessary tools and resources to conduct effective sex education at all levels,'' she said. Twenty-nine percent of teachers complained of inadequate materials, and 25 percent said students were a problem because they were embarrassed or ignorant about sex. Among other findings: _ 46 states plus the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> support AIDS education, and 43 plus the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> support instruction about other sexually transmitted diseases Forty-three support the teaching of abstinence. _ 32 states require or encourage instruction on pregnancy prevention <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> discourages such instruction and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> prohibits it. Only <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> specify contraception methods and outline the risks and benefits of each. _ Half the states require some kind of training or certification to teach sex education But only <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> require teachers to have taken a course in human sexuality. _ 87 percent of large districts have sex or AIDS curricula and 96 percent cover the negative aspects of teen-age sex More than 70 percent of the districts discuss abstinence as the best alternative in grades 7-10, but such lessons drop off to 50 percent in grades 11 and 12.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it may release some details of agents' visits to the nation's libraries to monitor Soviet and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bloc </LOCATION> intelligence agents. The program has been questioned by those who say it violates the confidentiality of library users. The bureau has been conducting what it calls an `` awareness program'' in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> area, telling librarians that Soviet and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bloc </LOCATION> agents use libraries to seek technical data and to approach potential recruits. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> also goes into libraries elsewhere in the country in response to specific counterintelligence investigations of suspected East Bloc agents who have used those facilities. The bureau says the program is a narrowly focused effort which does not infringe on the public's use of the nation's libraries. `` There is not a widespread investigation ... tromping on the rights of individuals engaged in the use of American libraries,'' said <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Milt </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahlerich </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s comments are in connection with an agreement reached with a private group which had sued seeking access to some of the information the bureau gathered in its investigations. The suit was filed under the Freedom of Information Act. A stipulation reached between the bureau and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> was signed Monday by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Oberdorfer </PERSON>. The bureau will begin processing more than 3,000 pages of documents related to library visits in at least 13 states, said archives director <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>. The archives is a non-profit research facility that collects declassified information on national security issues. Civil liberties and library groups have objected to the surveillance program. They say it has a chilling effect on constitutional free speech rights and violates state laws and library rules designed to protect the confidentiality of library users. <PERSON> Quinlan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shea </PERSON>, special counsel for the archives group, said the stipulation is an important step toward responding to the concerns of groups which have questioned the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s effort. `` We sensed in discussions that the bureau would like to sort of reassure the library community that this is n't some half-crazed search and destroy mission'' by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> in the nation's libraries, said <PERSON> Shea </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> on Tuesday began cutting down the barbed-wire fence and alarm system that divides it from <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, removing one more barrier between this increasingly liberal socialist country and the West. A crowd in this border town watched as bulldozers removed one of the concrete pylons that hold up the winding, 8-foot high fence. Rusted barbed wire lay in bundles nearby. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> says it expects to have all the fencing, which has a built-in electronic alarm system that was used to detect people escaping to the West, by Dec. 1, 1990. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> said last year it would remove the fence it built 40 years ago because of fewer travel restrictions, a desire for closer ties with <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and the cost of maintaining a barrier that has become obsolete. The event marks the `` closing of an era'' in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s relations with the West, said <PERSON> Andras </PERSON> <PERSON> Koevari </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. `` Hungarian glasnost has many faces, and one of them is the world passport which moved <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> closer to <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Koevari </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> last year instituted what are among Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s most liberal travel laws, allowing its citizens to travel to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> as often as they can afford it Because Hungarians do not require visas to visit neutral <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, millions have taken advantange of the new regulations to travel regularly. But the travel rules also have made <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> a key escape point for refugees from other, less liberal East Bloc countries such as <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tibor </PERSON> <PERSON> Vidus </PERSON>, a Hungarian border official, said 97 percent of those who try to flee across the Hungarian border to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> are not Hungarians. <PERSON> Balazs </PERSON> <PERSON> Novoki </PERSON>, a senior border guard official, estimated the cost of dismantling the system at between $ 500,000 to $ 660,000. He said civilians living in the border region were being asked to help tear down the barriers. The fence stands about a mile from the actual border. Between the two are field that authorities used to keep plowed so fleeing refugees could be more easily spotted. Once, during the 1950s, Hungarian authorities planted mines in the `` no man's land'' between border and fence. The electronic system was installed in 1972. With the fence gone, <PERSON> Novoki </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vidus </PERSON> both said the military would have a greater responsibility to watch for illegal crossings. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> is among the most liberal of the Soviet bloc nations. The Communist Party leadership in February endorsed a multiparty system, but leaders remain split over the pace and scope of reforms.

 <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> has approved plans submitted by another 36 states or territories to step up use of their <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> units in fighting drug trafficking, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. The additional approvals bring to 48 the number of plans now in place for the expanded use of Guard units. It also expands to $ 25.2 million the amount committed to the drug-interdiction program for the National Guard. The Pentagon action makes the states eligible for extra federal funds from a special congressional appropriation of $ 40 million approved last year to finance such National Guard operations. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> announced the first approvals on March 30, concentrating then on 12 high-priority border states. Those 12 states together were authorized to use 29.4 percent of the $ 40 million, or $ 11.8 million. On Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> approved commitment of another $ 13.43 million to 34 states, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. Of those on the latest approval list, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> will receive the most _ $ 1.8 million _ followed by <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> with $ 1.1 million and the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> with $ 873,835. `` Remaining plans are in the final review process,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said the plans of each state varied to some extent. But in general, the state and territorial governments are planning to increase National Guard operations by emphasizing more `` aerial photography and other imagery; radar surveillance; long-range reconnaissance; assistance in searching containers, and the transportation of law enforcement personnel, equipment and seized substances.'' In addition, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said some of the state governments planned to `` expand training of law enforcement personnel and increase the loans of military equipment.'' `` This expanded role does not include direct participation by Guard personnel in police activities such as arrest and seizure,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> stressed, adding its goal is `` supporting civilian drug law enforcement agencies in the nationwide crusade against drugs.'' Besides <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the other states and the amounts their Guard units are receiving include:

 An anti-apartheid activist was assassinated outside his home just days after completing a report contending death squads are stalking government opponents, his editor said Tuesday. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>, a university lecturer, was shot in the chest Monday by an assailant who fired a shotgun from a passing car, police said Tuesday. Police spokesman Col. <PERSON> Frans </PERSON> <PERSON> Malherbe </PERSON> said doctors removed 16 pellets from <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>'s body. Police offered a $ 4,000 reward for information leading to the killers and released sketches of three unidentified white male suspects. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Moss </PERSON>, co-editor of South African Review, said an article by <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> and a close friend, <PERSON> Maggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, was to appear in the political journal's next edition in August. `` Assassinations are used as one of the methods of controlling government opposition when all other methods such as detention or intimidation have failed,'' the article says. `` It is a very rare event indeed when such assassinations are ever solved. `` The past 12 months have witnessed a steady tempo of kidnappings and assassinations of anti-apartheid activists ... carried out by clandestine groups, presumably a death squad.'' Expressions of sorrow and outrage over the white activist's slaying came from blacks and whites, and from anti-apartheid, academic, labor and student groups Flags were flown at half-staff Tuesday at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witwatersrand </ORGANIZATION> where <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>, 44, taught anthropology. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, who worked with <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> against race discrimination, told hundreds of mourners at the <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> campus Monday night: `` There is only one group that stood to gain from this act: those who are dedicated to perpetuating the brutal and vicious system that <PERSON> David </PERSON> dedicated his life to opposing.'' A statement in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> from the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement said <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>'s death is `` the latest in a long chain of such acts carried out by supporters of the apartheid regime, determined to silence their opponents by whatever means.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> African Trade Unions said <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> `` was not just a sympathizer in our struggle: he was a friend, a comrade, an active participant.'' Several dozen black activists have been murdered in recent years. Many white activists in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> receive anonymous threats. But few have been attacked since the unsolved 1978 killing of political science lecturer <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>. Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> said: `` I want to make it clear on behalf of the government that the murder is strongly condemned and that no stone will be left unturned to apprehend those responsible.'' But South African Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said `` I would be surprised if the assassins are apprehended.'' In a statement from an Anglican Church meeting in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said it was `` yet another example of the methods used against those who stand for justice in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' The South African Council of Churches said <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>'s death `` has tragically demonstrated the vulnerability of anti-apartheid activists in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, given the fact that those who murder opponents of the apartheid system are never brought to book.'' The banned <ORGANIZATION> Detainees </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Support </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said of <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>: `` His work went a long way to exposing those acting under the cover of darkness.''

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> urged <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies Tuesday to denounce `` massive election fraud'' anticipated in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s presidential voting Sunday, saying, `` It is time for the plain truth. In particular, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called on European democracies to raise their voices against alleged election-rigging by Panamanian strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to ensure the victory of his figurehead candidate, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Duque </PERSON>. `` Let me be clear,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will not recognize the results of a fraudulent election engineered simply to keep <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in power.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made his remarks in a speech at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> before the Council of the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION>, an organization of businessmen with interests in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The address marked another step in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' year-old failed campaign to force <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> from power following his <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> indictment on drug-smuggling charges. Fearing that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> will steal Sunday's election, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is trying to discredit the outcome. `` It is evident that the regime is ready to resort to massive election fraud in order to remain in power,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` The <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> regime continues to threaten and intimidate Panamanians who believe in democracy. `` It's also attempting to limit the presence and freedom of action of international observers and to prevent journalists from reporting on the election process in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has not yet announced the makeup of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> observer team. `` All nations that value democracy ... should speak out against election fraud in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` And that means the democracies of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, they should be speaking out about this ....'' He said, `` It is time for the plain truth: the day of the dictator is over. The people's right to democracy must not be denied.'' In <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, Maj. <PERSON> Edgardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, a spokesman for the pro-Noriega Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, said the opposition has been demoralized `` and they know they are going to lose the election. `` They have sent an SOS to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, ` Urgent, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to take immediate action or <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> will stay,''' <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> said. Touching on developments in other nations of the hemisphere, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> accused <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> of enacting restrictive laws to thwart the opposition in elections next February. `` The result is a stacked deck against the opposition and stacked rules of the game,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Setting out guidelines by which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will judge whether <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s elections are free, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the government must allow outside observers to have free access to all election places and proceedings. `` It means a secret ballot on election day, the freedom to campaign, to organize, to hold rallies and to poll public opinion, to operate independent radio and TV stations as well,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` It means the absence of intimidation either from a politicized Sandinista military or police, or from those neighborhood block committees that control peoples' ration cards,'' he said. `` It means an end to the arrests and bullying of opposition leaders.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to end its support of the leftist Sandinista regime. `` The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> must understand that we hold it accountable for the consequences of this intervention and for progress toward peace in the region and democracy in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' the president said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> `` is on its way to joining the democratic mainstream'' following the presidential election Monday of Gen. <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>. `` We congratulate President-elect <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> on his electoral victory and look forward to working with him,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Later, White House spokesman <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> later told reporters there were `` several instances of questionable but not illegal procedures'' in the Paraguayan elections. `` The small number of votes affected by these irregularities would not make a significant difference in the overall election results,'' in which <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> got 70 percent of the vote, <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> read the names of his slain parents Tuesday, joining thousands of Israelis who remembered the 6 million Jewish victims of the Nazi Holocaust by reciting their names at ceremonies. The programs at the parliament, army bases, holy sites and schools came on an annual remembrance day marking the World War II tragedy that presaged the founding of the Jewish state. About 100,000 Holocaust survivors have settled in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and the legacy of helpless Jews driven to their deaths in gas chambers or shot anonymously in forests, has been a driving force behind the nation's vigilance about security. This year's observance was organized around the theme `` Unto every person there is a name,'' and participants in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and 15 other countries were expected to recite the names of some 300,000 Holocaust victims before sundown, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> radio reported. The 77-year-old head of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc joined the program outside <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s parliament building, where six torches flickered in the wind. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> lost his parents, two sisters, their husbands and their children. `` My father, <PERSON> Shlomo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ysernitzky </PERSON>, who escaped before the train left for a death camp and while seeking shelter among friends in the village where he grew up, they, his friends from childhood, killed him,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said, his voice quavering uncharacteristically. He paused, then named as other <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> victims his mother, <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION>; his sisters, <PERSON> Miriam </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rivka </PERSON>; their husbands, <PERSON> Mordechai </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yaacov </PERSON>, and their children. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has never disclosed how his family perished, but they are believed to have died in death camps, said his aide, <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON>. The prime minister also read the names of 30 other victims before other Cabinet members continued the listing. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, born in <LOCATION> Ruzinoy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, immigrated to pre-state Palestine alone in 1935. He helped found a resistance group, known as the <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fighters </ORGANIZATION>, or the <ORGANIZATION> Stern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gang </ORGANIZATION>, which staged raids against the British rulers in <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>. He has seldom spoken about his personal loss, although he frequently refers to the Holocaust and compares <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s current adversaries to the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>. Earlier Tuesday, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> condemned <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s meeting in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> considers the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> a terrorist group and refuses to deal with it. `` This man says a lot of things to the Jewish people,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. `` He is following the same tradition as the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>.'' Holocaust day is one of national mourning in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Flags are flown at half-staff, melancholy music is played on the radios and entertainment places are closed. The day's events began when sirens sounded at 10 a.m. -LRB- 3 a.m. EDT -RRB-, bringing pedestrias and cars to a standstill for two minutes of silent tribute. At the <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Yehuda </PERSON> outdoor shopping mall in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, merchants and shoppers paused to bow their heads. Name-reading ceremonies at schools and army bases were broadcast on the radio. Survivors choked back tears as they recited names; others told horrifying stories. <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Eliaz </PERSON>, a survivor of the <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> death camp in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, told how she gave her starving, 7-day-old daughter a fatal injection of morphine at the coaxing of a Polish nurse who feared both mother and child would be sent to the gas chambers. `` I killed my own little girl,'' she said. At the observance at the parliament, Dutch-born <PERSON> Leah </PERSON> <PERSON> Zonershein </PERSON>, a survivor of the <LOCATION> Bergen-Belsen </LOCATION> death camp in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, recited the names of her deceased parents, <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hannah </PERSON>, then could not continue. She said later she felt it was necessary to summon bitter memories to ensure the tragedy is not forgotten. `` Holocaust day became a routine thing here,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Zonershein </PERSON>, 62. `` The number, 6 million, says nothing to most people. But name after name after name, that gets the message across.'' Holocaust day is observed midway between the anniversary of the start of a 1943 Jewish uprising against German troops in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, and Israeli Independence Day, which this year is May 10.

<HEAD>Church Buys Houses To Get Rid of Drug Dealers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Drug pushers are n't dealing across the street and gunshots no longer interrupt services at a small Baptist church since the congregation bought a few abandoned buildings used as crack houses. The 293 members of Third Shiloh Baptist voted unanimously in February to put down $ 80,000 for five houses with money they started saving 20 years ago for a new church. `` We were afraid to come out,'' said <PERSON> Emma </PERSON> <PERSON> Snowden </PERSON>, a church board member. `` And they were n't ashamed. The street had more traffic than Canal Street,'' the city's main business thoroughfare. The church, and the houses, are a block from the Desire public housing project _ the city's largest and one of its most notorious for drug use and violence. Church complaints led to two busts in the last five months and the sound of gunfire sometimes punctuated services, <PERSON> Snowden </PERSON> said. The congregation is now using federal money to renovate the dwellings so the church can rent them out and stabilize the neighborhood to keep dealers out. A bank was asking $ 90,000 for the properties but sold them for much less, officials said. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, church board chairman, said <ORGANIZATION> Shiloh </ORGANIZATION> is negotiating to buy two other houses from another owner. The maximum federal grant for fixing up a three-bedroom house is $ 8,500, and the landlord must rent it for 10 years to a low-income tenant, said <PERSON> Shelia </PERSON> <PERSON> Danzey </PERSON>, director of the city office of housing and urban affairs. <PERSON> Danzey </PERSON> said 1,000 units have been renovated in the city under the program, but Third Shiloh's five are the first owned by a church or community group. The tenants will pay about $ 125 a month for a three-bedroom apartment and there is already a waiting list, <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said. Each house has two units. Some of the rent money will go to a scholarship fund and 15 percent to 25 percent toward building the new church members were saving for, he said.

 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Commandant <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> today faulted <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s revised plan to clean up the nation's largest oil spill, but promised the effort will be completed this summer. `` The plan is very thin. There's not a lot of backup or substantiation,'' said <PERSON> Yost </PERSON>, an admiral chosen by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to track the cleanup effort for the federal government. `` We are going to be done this summer,'' <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> also said at a news briefing after arriving for a weeklong tour. `` Some beaches are going to be sparkling, some beaches are going to be far from sparkling.'' <PERSON> Yost </PERSON>'s comments followed the release Monday of <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s revised strategy to clean up the oil spilled by the tanker <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> wants to burn or bury the sludge recovered, and says environmental laws may have to be bypassed to allow the disposal. The plan, submitted only hours before a deadline, requires <PERSON> Yost </PERSON>'s approval before it is put into effect He said he will make that decision within a week. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> faced protests today in at least three states. Consumer groups in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state asked for boycotts of Exxon products. In <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, 20 state legislators joined in the call for a one-day boycott, and demonstrations were planned at the port of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, where the crippled tanker is expected to be repaired. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s proposal immediately drew the scrutiny of Alaskan environmental officials, who contend that <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> failed to act quickly to clean up the more than 10 million gallons of oil spilled when the tanker hit a reef March 24 in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. The plan estimates that poor weather and logistical problems will force a slowdown in the cleanup through September, cutting by 50 percent the number of days the crews can actually spend on the beaches and water. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s two-part strategy on cleanup and disposal makes no provisions for continuing the operation beyond mid-September. `` It's our objective and we're convinced ... with the plan that we currently have that we'll get the major part of this spill cleaned up by the middle of September 1989, <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, said in an interview on `` CBS This Morning.'' The plan also notes that 191 miles of moderately fouled coastline may be left untouched to be cleansed naturally by the environment. Traces of the spill have been found 500 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> along the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>. `` Lightly oiled areas might not require cleaning,'' the report said, `` if environmental considerations indicate that allowing natural forces to operate produces a better result than the mechanical process.'' `` We are going to have to take a hard look at that,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamoreaux </PERSON>, the ranking state environmental official monitoring the cleanup. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wuerpel </PERSON> of the state's <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> said the plan did not help newly fouled communities like <LOCATION> Chignik </LOCATION>, 525 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>. `` I think there is an element of arrogance; I think there is an element of patronizing; I think there is an element of unwillingness to redress the injury,'' said <PERSON> Wuerpel </PERSON>, who is coordinating the efforts of the numerous state agencies involved in the cleanup. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s proposal, a revised version of an earlier plan that government authorities rejected as incomplete, divides 364 miles of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s oil-tainted shores into four categories based on the amount of pollution. It covers areas within Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>, as well as those outside the immediate spill zone, and calls for nearly 3,400 workers to participate in the cleanup. The cost was not disclosed, but <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> reportedly is paying clean-up workers $ 16.67 an hour. The worst areas _ three miles of sludge-covered beaches on several small islands in the sound _ would be targeted immediately, with the others scheduled for gradual cleansing through Sept. 15. The recovered waste would be strained for usable oil that can be refined, and the oil-laced wastewater could be treated at the <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s disposal plant in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>. The gunk and sludge that resists treatment or salvage will be burned or buried, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> proposed. Both methods likely will require exemptions from local environmental laws, which <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> says may arouse opposition from environmentalists and others. `` We are concerned about the approval process,'' the study said, adding that <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> would seek permission to have the laws bypassed temporarily. `` I'm sure there is a portion of it which indicates that some of the ... material that's been picked up or described as sludge, burning would be one way of disposing of that, which might require as indicated some relaxation of some air quality,'' <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Scientist Says Hungry Little Creature Threatens Great Lakes Food

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A spiny-tailed little creature with a big appetite, a water flea that may have hitched a ride from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> aboard Soviet freighters, is threatening to disrupt the food chain in the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION>, a federal scientist said Tuesday. Only a half-inch long, the predator called bythotrephes is a variety of water flea with a long, spiny tail, said <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanderploeg </PERSON>, a scientist with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. What bythotrephes lacks in size, it makes up for in appetite. <PERSON> Vanderploeg </PERSON> said his research showed one of the little creatures in a day can clear 1 -LCB- quarts of water of the native water fleas that provide food for newborn fish. `` For an animal this small, it represents a high rate of clearance,'' <PERSON> Vanderploeg </PERSON> said at <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lakes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbor </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mich </LOCATION>. The water fleas native to the Great Lakes provide food for juvenile alewives, bloaters and perch, which in turn are food for salmon, trout and other large predatory fish. Because of bythotrephes, in future years `` it is possible that, for example, alewives, certain forage fish, could be less abundant, and since these forage fish would be less abundant, salmon and trout could also become less abundant,'' <PERSON> Vanderploeg </PERSON> said. However, a more precise forecast of the effect of the European predator must await a better understanding of the Great Lakes food chain, he said. Bythotrephes were first found in <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huron </LOCATION> in 1984 and by 1986 had spread to <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>. They are now found in all the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION>. The predators may have been brought from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in water ballast aboard empty grain freighters from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and dumped into the lakes, <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION> said. Bythotrephes are found in freshwater throughout northern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. There, however, `` it is not disruptive to the food chain in the sense that it has been there for a long time,'' <PERSON> Vanderploeg </PERSON> said. `` All the plankton and fish that have evolved there are used to having it around.'' Although the European predator can damage the Great Lakes food supply for very young fish, `` at a certain stage in the life cycle of a fish, bythotrephes would then become food for that fish,'' <PERSON> Vanderploeg </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Denver Abolishes Zoning Ordinance Dubbed `Living In Sin' Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> residents will no longer have to carry around their marriage certificates and housing inspectors can stop counting toothbrushes. <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> has abolished its `` living in sin'' law. The ordinance dating from the 1960s, when residents feared hippie invasions and communal living would ruin their neighborhoods, was repealed by the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> 7-6 Monday night after spirited debate. `` Zoning laws are here to regulate density, not relationships,'' said Councilwoman <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, who voted for the change. Under the law, boarders and unrelated people were not allowed to live in the same house in areas zoned R-0. In areas zoned R-1, a homeowner was required to obtain a $ 20 boarder's permit to cover a non-relative. The two classifications covered about 60 percent of the city, which has a population of more than 500,000. Although residents frequently ignored the law, officials enforced it when a complaint was filed. Fines were $ 999 a day. In many cases if a homeowner was caught violating the law, he or she had to sell the house, sometimes at a loss, to avoid paying the fine. Councilwoman <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Donohue </PERSON> said the law forced people to carry their marriage certificates around with them and that zoning inspectors complained about having to count toothbrushes in homes. The one-vote margin reflected strong support for keeping the measure on the books. `` The family is the fundamental structure that preserves our society,'' said Councilman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>. The vote is a `` step toward destroying our city,'' said Councilman <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Hackworth </PERSON>. Councilman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Crider </PERSON> called passage `` a sad day in the city of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>.'' Eight years ago, when there was an attempt to change the law, many churches had opposed the action. This time, however, most of the opposition came from families and a real estate agent who sold houses based on the zoning restrictions. The agent tells `` buyers that no one can move in next to them that is n't married. This appeals particularly to families,'' <PERSON> Donohue </PERSON> said. Three nuns who lived together were among those who had been targeted as violators before the law was rescinded. `` They wanted all but one of us to move out,'' said one of the nuns, who asked that her name not be used. `` To me, it's wasteful to have just one person living in a dwelling with four bedrooms. It's very sinful.'' The Mexican consul, students sharing expenses and unmarried couples also were affected by the law.

 A committee appointed by Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> to work out details of his Palestinian elections proposal is discussing ways to involve the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in observing the balloting, a spokesman said Tuesday. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> involvement, which could answer one Palestinian objection to <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s plan, was among various tactics being studied on how to conduct the proposed vote in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON>. In the occupied territories Tuesday, 12 Arabs were wounded in clashes with troops, according to <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reporters and hospital officials. One of the reported victims was a 7-year-old girl shot in the head in a clash in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>'s Shati refugee camp. The worst confrontation was in the crowded market in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, where soldiers opened fire on dozens of stone-throwing protesters, the reporters said. Six people suffered gunshot wounds, hospital officials said. About 3,000 police were deployed around <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Leilat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kadr </LOCATION>, the Moslem night of prayers marking the prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>'s receiving the holy Koran. Soldiers were reported to be stopping young Palestinians in the occupied territories from entering <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> to prevent a repetition of rioting that occurred on the first day of the Moslem holy month of <LOCATION> Ramadan </LOCATION>. The main prayer takes place at the <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aqsa </ORGANIZATION> mosque compound, one of Islam's holiest sites and the location of the rioting. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said 10,000 worshipers were expected at <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aqsa </ORGANIZATION>, compared with up to 50,000 in previous years. Israelis also marked a national holiday Tuesday to mourn the Jewish victims of the Nazi Holocaust, and <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> compared <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> as he protested French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s meeting with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said on Israeli radio that Jews everywhere should beware of <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. `` This man says a lot of things to the Jewish people. ... He is following the same tradition as the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. The Polish-born prime minister later read the names of his own family members killed by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>. Hundreds of other Israelis recited the names of other victims in memorial events throughout the country. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s visit sparked several protest demonstrations outside the French Consulate in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. The largest group, 50 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faithful </ORGANIZATION>, carried the French tricolor flag marked with a black stain. The group's leader, <PERSON> Gershon </PERSON> <PERSON> Salomon </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s meeting with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> `` soiled <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s honor'' and urged <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> to extradict <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> as a murderer. The group advocates rebuilding the Jewish temple on the site now covered by the Dome of the Rock and <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Aqsa </PERSON> mosques. <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON> said Tuesday the premier has appointed a team to work out a blueprint for elections in the occupied territories, despite <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> demands that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> withdraw its troops before any vote. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s plan calls for elections to chose Palestinians from the territories to negotiate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on a five-year period of autonomy, to be followed by talks on the final status of the lands occupied since the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and Palestinians in the territories have rejected the idea of limited autonomy under continued Israeli control since it was first suggested more than 10 years ago. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> made his plan public last month in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> after international pressure built on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to find a way to end the 16-month Palestinian uprising, which has taken the lives of 458 Palestinians and 18 Israelis. <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON> said one idea considered for the balloting was some form of active <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> participation in overseeing the elections, which would answer Palestinian and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> demands for international supervision of the vote. `` I think that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> participation and help can be considered,'' <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON> said. `` We are always ready to be assisted by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> which is genuinely interested in achieving peace ... and enjoys the trust of both sides.'' Israeli news reports said the blueprint might be presented to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials by Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>, who is due to visit <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in three weeks. A Rabin spokesman declined comment. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> told representatives of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s collective farms in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should not rush into elections `` out of the blue,'' but should agree on an entire process for the vote. Facing complaints about stone-throwing attacks on the cars of Jewish settlers in the occupied territories, <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> suggested <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> consider subsidizing protective windows in the vehicles of the more than 70,000 settlers. It would cost $ 6.7 million to $ 8.3 million, and `` we will suggest this to the residents of the territories, and we should offer to subsidize it if necessary,'' he said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday stepped up its campaign against the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> rebels by saying that close ties with a future Cambodian government would not be possible if it is heavily influenced by that Marxist group. The statement by spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> came amid an intensification of efforts by the Vietnamese-backed government in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and non-communist rebel forces to reach an accommodation on the shape of a future government. With <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> planning to withdraw the remainder of its forces from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> by this September, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has become increasingly concerned about the possibility that the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> could regain power there. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, the most militarily powerful of the three resistance forces, are estimated to have killed more than one million Cambodians during their 3 -LCB- years in power in the late 1970s. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is totally opposed to a return to dominance in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>,'' Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said. `` We believe that the best means to achieve this goal would be acceptance by all parties of a comprehensive settlement agreement under which the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> people were able to determine their own future through a process of free choice.'' She reaffirmed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> view that an interim coalition government should be formed to organize elections and that <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, the former head of state, is a logical leader of such an arrangement. She said that whether the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, minus discredited leaders such as <PERSON> Pol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON>, are permitted to participate in such an interim government is one thing the Cambodian factions themselves will have to decide. But, she said, that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> ability to work with any future Cambodian government `` would be related to the level of <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> participation in that government.'' Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said it is imperative to have a settlement that includes effective safeguards to keep the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> from dominating <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> once more. `` We are convinced that in free and fair elections, the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> people would reject the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>,'' she said. As part of stepped-up <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomacy in the region, Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> met on Monday with <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> during a visit to <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> said later, after a meeting with <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Suharto </PERSON>, said he was optimistic a settlement was within reach. The non-communist resistance is eager to reach a political settlement with the Vietnamese-backed government before the withdrawal of the Vietnamese forces. Without an agreement, there is concern that <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> will regain power in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> because of their superior military capability. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has reflected its concern by considering for the first time the provision of military aid to the two non-communist factions.

A repeat of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Roseanne'' was the highest-rated show of the week, edging a new episode of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Cosby Show.'' `` Cosby'' had a slightly lower rating but a higher share, apparently because of daylight saving time when there are fewer viewers at 8 p.m. EDT compared with 9 p.m. when `` Roseanne'' airs.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> condemned <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s system of apartheid on Tuesday and urged <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> to keep trying to resolve its neighbor's racial turmoil Church choirs, tribal drummers and a military honor guard welcomed the pontiff here, the third stop of a nine-day pilgrimage to four African and <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> nations. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> was flown from the island of Reunion in an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Concorde </ORGANIZATION>, the first time a pontiff has traveled in the supersonic passenger plane. President <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON>, one of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s elder statesmen, bowed and shook hands with <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> after the pontiff customarily knelt on the tarmac and kissed the ground. The pope was expected to discuss <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s racial policies during his three-day visit to <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, and to speak out about the rapid spread of AIDS in this largely Christian southern African country. Thousands of Zambians _ including women who wore sari-like cloths emblazoned with <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s portrait _ gathered to hear the pope commend their government for fostering `` constructive dialogue'' with <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>. He also mounted a harsh attack on apartheid. `` Your continuing efforts to promote constructive dialogue by the parties involved must be your response to the unacceptable system of apartheid,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said. `` Racism stands condemned but it is not enough to condemn,'' he said. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, where the white minority wields political and economic power over 24 million voteless blacks, is high on the agenda of talks between the pope and <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON>, officials said. <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON>, 65, is head of the Frontline States regional group spearheading African efforts to end apartheid. The other members are <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON> told <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> that black nations neighboring <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> were confronted by `` the affliction of apartheid ... an all-round human degradation declared by the international community as a sin against humanity itself.'' The Frontline States were unhappy during the pontiff's last <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> travels in October, when his plane was diverted by bad weather to <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. Foreign Minister P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> welcomed the pope despite <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> statements that the pope would not visit <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> while apartheid remains entrenched. <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON>, a former Church of <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> mission teacher who led the former British colony of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rhodesia </LOCATION> to independence as <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> on Oct. 24, 1964, is a lay preacher for the Methodist-related <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zambia </ORGANIZATION>. He outlawed political opposition by declaring <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> a one-party state in 1972 and since has survived several coup attempts. <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> is heavily in debt to foreign lenders, unemployment and inflation are at record levels, urban crime is rampant, shortages of basic commodities are commonplace and the incidence of AIDS has been rising rapidly. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome has killed 900 Zambians in the last four years, including one of <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON>'s sons. <PERSON> Masuzgo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON> died at age 30 in December 1986. There are about 1.7 million Catholics among <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>'s 7 million people.

While on the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> island of Reunion earlier Tuesday, the pope beatified a 19th century French missionary considered the apostle of the island's slaves. The beatification represented a first step towards possible sainthood for <PERSON> Jean-Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rousseau </PERSON>, known as <PERSON> Brother </PERSON> <PERSON> Scubilion </PERSON>, who died in 1867. <PERSON> Rousseau </PERSON> spent 34 years on the island, teaching catechism to the African slaves brought to the island by the French colonists.

 The head of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> who was associated with strong government control over church life has been forced to retire, an Austrian Roman Catholic newsletter said Tuesday. The retirement of State Secretary <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Miklos </PERSON> as president of the office as of Monday was confirmed by the Hungarian news agency <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION>, which said <PERSON> Miklos </PERSON>' duties were taken over by deputy president <PERSON> Barna </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarkadi </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>. No new president was appointed. <PERSON> Miklos </PERSON>'s retirement came after what <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> described as `` crucial changes'' in Hungarian church policy. It said the essence of the change is that state control is to be withdrawn from all fields of church a life so as to `` finalize the separation of the state and churches.'' <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> said the change in church policy serves the purpose of expanding the cooperation between the state and churches in the social, political, cultural and educational spheres. The official report made clear the existing church affairs office would be completely overhauled and given a new name in the spirit of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s political and social reforms. `` There is a need for open political activity in order to create a forum for coordination of interests that would attract ... church, state and party officials, as well as independent and prestigious politicians,'' <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> said.

<HEAD>Navy Delaying Deployment of Trident 2</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has found the mechanical problem that caused a Trident 2 missile to explode last March, but corrective design changes will contribute to a three-month delay in deployment, a military official said Tuesday. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s chief spokesman, said a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> board of inquiry had blamed the failure on a mechanical linkage in the first-stage nozzle. `` We now expect the first operational missiles to be at sea on the -LRB- submarine -RRB- USS Tennessee in March'' of 1990, he said. The mechanical linkage is responsible for moving the rocket nozzles back and forth during the early seconds after a launch. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> previously had disclosed preliminary findings, made final by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> board. `` They -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- have decided that they have to do some redesign and modification of the mechanical linkage that transmits the nozzle position commands to the nozzle exit cone at the base of the missile,'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. `` Incorporating these changes will allow us to conduct the next test in July.'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> declined to estimate the cost of the design changes, but described them as `` fairly simple.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said the missile's builder, the <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, would have to bear the cost The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s investigation began March 21, shortly after a Trident 2 missile fired from the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> blew up just four seconds after launch. The missile popped to the surface as planned and the first stage ignited properly, but then the missile began spinning like a burning pinwheel and exploded. It was the first submarine launch of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s newest and most powerful nuclear weapon. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said Tuesday the delay in deployment was based on two other factors in addition to the design change. `` First, there has been a cessation of all propellant casting, including the -LRB- Trident -RRB- second-stage motors, due to the explosion at the Hercules plant in <LOCATION> Magna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, on March 29,'' he explained. `` Second, there's an on-going strike at the <PERSON> Kaiser </PERSON> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Aerotech </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- plant in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Leandro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, which has resulted in stoppage of delivery of nozzles for both the second and third stage of the Trident rocket motors. We anticipate that the delivery of those will resume by June.'' On <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, D-Wis., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, praised the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> for its willingness to delay the Trident's deployment, singling out program manager Rear Adm. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Malley </PERSON> `` I hope everyone will heap praise on the program manager for striving to make his missile work rather than damning him for failing to meet an arbitrary deadline _ the great crime of the B-1 -LRB- bomber -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> said. The three-stage Trident 2 is a more lethal version of the weapon that is the heart of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s naval nuclear deterrent, the Trident 1. The new missile can deliver three to 12 nuclear warheads to individual targets up to 6,000 miles away. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> says the new weapon is much more accurate than its undersea predecessors _ <ORGANIZATION> Polaris </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Poseidon </PERSON> and Trident 1 _ and can match the targeting ability of land-based missiles even though it is launched from a submerged, moving submarine. The <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> is the first of nine submarines slated to carry 24 of the missiles.

<TEXT>
 Christian leader Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said Tuesday he may compromise with Moslem militiamen to end the fighting in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, but will pursue diplomatic channels to oust Syrian troops from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The commander of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s mainly Christian army said he will consider lifting a blockade of three illegal ports run by Syrian-backed Moslem militias to end eight weeks of fierce fighting that has killed 278 people. As he made the offer at a news conference, shelling duels continued between Christian gunners and an alliance of Druse militiamen and Syrian troops who have ignored Friday's cease-fire call by the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. Police said two people were killed and eight wounded Tuesday, bringing the toll of wounded to 1,010 since the current fighting erupted March 8. Asked about the blockade, <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said it `` could be suspended.'' `` The ports issue is no longer the basic issue. Syrian military presence in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> is the issue,'' he said. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> had declared a `` war of liberation'' against 40,000 Syrian troops deployed across 70 percent of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate. But he added: `` The hot phase in the war of liberation is over ... We are prepared to pursue liberation through diplomatic means.'' He said he was waiting to discuss the ports blockade Wednesday with <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> envoys due to arrive from <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. League official <PERSON> Lakhdar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahimi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Aziz </PERSON> <PERSON> Jassem </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, will try to salvage the cease-fire and finalize deployment of a multinational Arab observer force. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> called the Arab plans a `` breakthrough.'' `` The observers will be watching the Syrians here and our problem will be discussed by the forthcoming <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> summit conference'' this month, <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said. He and other Christian leaders accuse the Syrians of breaking their peacekeeping mandate by siding with the Moslems against the Christians. In <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, diplomatic sources said the <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> government told the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> representatives that fighting would persist until <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> lifted the blockades. <PERSON> Ibrahimi </PERSON> was to meet Wednesday with acting Premier <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, head of the Moslem Cabinet in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s dual government. An aide to <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> said they will discuss a compromise calling for the deployment of Arab observers at militia-run ports to `` guarantee that they are not used for illegal activities.'' The aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it was <PERSON> Ibrahimi </PERSON>'s responsibility to convince Druse warlord <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON> and Shiite Moslem leader <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> to accept the proposed solution. Syrian gunners maintained a sporadic bombardment of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 310-square-mile Christian enclave throughout Tuesday Each side accused the other of starting the barrage. A police spokesman said Syrian gunners targeted the coastal strip north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and prevented the French tanker Penhors from approaching a power station to unload fuel oil. A main power cable was damaged in the barrage, stripping the capital of its daily two-hour ration of electricity, said the spokesman, who customarily is not named. Most civilians deserted their apartments and sought refuge in underground shelters as they have most of the time since the fighting began. A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> report published Tuesday said the battles have caused $ 250 million in damage, destroyed two-thirds of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s fuel storage facilities, hit 150 factories and 3,000 residential blocks, and paralyzed industry. The Geneva-based Office of the U.N. Disaster Relief Coordinator said the priority is setting up an emergency food reserve for 50,000 families and supplying drugs for the chronically sick. It said two-thirds of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s population is affected by the strife, which has caused more than 100,000 people to flee abroad and 500,000 to escape <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> for safer parts of the country.

<TEXT>
 Soldiers at <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s largest army garrison Tuesday repelled an attack by Sinhalese militants who may have been searching for weapons and killed at least three raiders, a military official said. Five soldiers were injured in the raid, which came during a heavy downpour said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. At least 100 militants attacked the <LOCATION> Panagoda </LOCATION> army garrison 12 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> with grenades and automatic weapons, he said. The garrison usually holds between 10,000 and 15,000 soldiers. It was the biggest raid on an army post by militants since they launched a bloody campaign to protest government peace overtures to Tamil rebels, who are fighting for a separate homeland, the official said. The Sinhalese militants, who belong to the left-wing <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, said a 1987 India-backed peace accord giving the Tamil minority limited autonomy made too many concessions They began killing government officials and ruling party members. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> sponsored the accord, sending troops to northern and eastern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, because of the sympathies of its own 60 million Tamils to the rebel cause. Indian Foreign Secretary <PERSON> Shailendra </PERSON> <PERSON> Kumar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> met Tuesday with President <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> to discuss the withdrawal of Indian peacekeeping troops. Sri Lankan officials were to meet Wednesday with Tamil rebel leaders for talks on ending their 6-year-old separatist war. The campaign for a Tamil nation has claimed 10,000 lives. Sinhalese militants have been blamed for more than 3,000 killings since January. The militants have attacked army camps and police stations to get weapons. The military official said the attackers of the Panagoda garrison penetrated the camp's perimeter and came within yards of its armory before being beaten back. Army soldiers searched rice paddies and jungles near the camp for the militants, he said. Sinhalese, who are mostly Buddhists, form 75 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 18 million people. They control the government and the military. Tamils, predominantly Hindus, make up 18 percent of the population and allege discrimination in jobs and education by the Sinhalese.

 <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> was just speaking his mind and not representing the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration when he forecast failure for <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, administration officials said Tuesday. There is widespread hope inside the government that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can seize on <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> arms control concessions, according to official spokesmen. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> has been defense secretary for just over one month, and his prediction in a televised weekend interview that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> would fail and be replaced by a hardliner caused a stir in official <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and White House chief of staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> quickly stepped forward with more optimistic assessments, although they did not publicly rebuke <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>. Despite the official optimism, there was cause to worry about the future of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reform, officials said. <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION>'s pessimistic predictions came just a day after the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Pravda, in an unprecedented development, published five pages of speeches by party officials saying <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms had damaged the economy and were undercutting the Kremlin And the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> declassified a report on April 23 saying <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had been forced to alter or postpone many planned reforms, including a key one, decontrolling prices. A significant segment of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence community believes that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> faces limited chances of success, although many government analysts think the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ought to take advantage of his arms control concessions, according to administration and congressional sources. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> predicted in a weekend interview that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> would fail in his effort to reform the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and likely would be replaced by a hardliner.

A <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking anonymously, denied that <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> was trying to offset West German pressure on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to negotiate with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to eliminate short-range nuclear missiles. `` He was not trying to be Machiavellian,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official. `` He was just saying what he believes. In his mind, he is still on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>,'' where <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> served congressman from <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> for 12 years and was No. 2 in the Republican leadership. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, speaking Monday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` wanted to see perestroika -LRB- reform -RRB- succeed in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.

Success for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> would give the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration a chance to capitalize on the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader's sweeping offers to cut Soviet conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and overall strategic arsenal by half. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> reaffirmed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hopes for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> by reissuing the text of a speech he gave last month. `` We very much want perestroika to succeed, and we very much want the General Secretary -LRB- <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> -RRB- to succeed. We think that's in the best interest of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the best interest of the world because it will result in a more open, stable and secure <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s statement <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION> sparked the controversy by saying in an interview broadcast last Saturday that `` if I had to guess today, I would guess ultimately he would fail,'' and would be replaced by a leader `` far more hostile'' to the West. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said much the same thing last Tuesday, telling <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> he had become convinced <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms were sincere because it was clear that `` the Soviet system has been a failure.'' `` I think it's going to be extremely difficult for him to succeed, and I think there is a very real likelihood that he'll either have to reverse course, or that or one reason or another, ultimately have to resort to force, perhaps in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, perhaps in terms of dealing with the ethnic unrest inside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>'s remarks mirrored an assessment voiced last October by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>, then the No. 2 official at <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and now the deputy White House national security adviser.

 Heavy rains have helped the western Corn Belt and nothern <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, but much of the sorely damaged winter wheat area is still parched from lack of moisture, a government report said Tuesday. Winter wheat was in `` mostly fair to poor'' condition during the final week of April, particularly in the central and southern areas of the plains, the Joint Agricultural Weather Facility said. Butg rain helped improve winter wheat in the northern <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>. `` In <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, high temperatures and wind stressed winter wheat,'' the report said. `` Condition was mostly very poor to poor.

 A man who was arrested after being videotaped flinging cash to children through the sunroof of his fancy car has been sentenced to 15 years in prison and fined $ 2 million for dealing cocaine. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, 28, had pleaded in March guilty to possession with intent to distribute more than two pounds of cocaine. `` On occasion he made well-publicized drives through the area in a flashy, expensive car, passing out currency to the children, thus brandishing to the citizenry, and especially to the pliable young, that drug dealing was a profitable activity to be emulated,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Devitt </PERSON> said Monday.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> expressed alarm on Tuesday about `` the rising tide of violence'' in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> as it offered its first public comment about recent assassinations of Arabs accused of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation troops. The killings of Palestinians by other Palestinians, occurring amid the backdrop of the uprising in the occupied territories, have increased after a Palestinian underground group issued a call for stepped-up action against collaborators. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said the killings on either side `` frustrate the search for peace.'' The Palestinians attacked as collaborators were accused of working with the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> army, the occupation administration or the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> intelligence service. Israeli Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> has accused the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> of conducting a `` wave of terror'' to undermine <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s proposal for elections in the occupied territories. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> plans to hold elections among the 1.4 million Palestinians on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> to choose leaders to negotiate an interim self-rule arrangement. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has barred negotiating with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which last year declared a Palestinian state. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> have endorsed the proposal as a step toward an overall settlement of the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict. Asked about the killings, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said: `` We are alarmed by the rising tide of violence, and are shocked by the increasing human toll in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>.'' The spokeswoman pointed out that during the past two weeks, 20 Palestinians have been killed and about 200 others wounded in clashes with the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Defense Forces. `` Fourteen Palestinians have been killed by other Palestinians during the same period. These actions by both sides frustrate the search for peace,'' Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> added. She said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> urges all sides to `` exercise restraint and replace violence with a climate conducive to political dialogue.'' Asked if the killings could make it more difficult for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to conduct the elections, Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said `` any type'' of violence was `` not conductive to moving the peace process forward.'' Some 458 Palestinians and 18 Israelis have died since the uprising began in December 1987.

 Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> will visit the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for the first time in November to address an <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> convention, federation leaders said Tuesday. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> has been denied permission in the past to visit the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> but an adviser in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to attend the spring meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>'s governing body said <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> would be allowed to travel to the convention. <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>, whose efforts to visit <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> have also been stymied by <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, has accepted a reciprocal invitation to visit <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> next year, a <LOCATION> Kirkland </LOCATION> spokesman said. <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said that, with the Polish government's recent recognition of Solidarity and announced plans for democratic election reforms, the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> will support <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration plans to give new economic aid to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. The federation's support, he said, was dependent `` on continued progress in the area of human rights.'' Still, while calling the apparent approval of <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> visit a welcome step, <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> could not disguise his contempt for the Polish government, which had outlawed Solidarity since its inception in the early 1980s. `` I do n't give a damn about the backing of the Polish government,'' <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said when asked whether <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> would be addressing the convention as a representative of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. `` He is not an emissary of his government. I'm not interested in dealing with emissaries of his government. He, all his life, has been a fighter for free and independent trade unionism and that's what he represents and what he stands for in the world today.'' <PERSON> Jacek </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> adviser and candidate for Parliament in the June 6 Polish elections, met with the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> executive council Tuesday afternoon to discuss the <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> visit and ways <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unions could assist Solidarity. <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Rex </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardesty </PERSON> said that support in the past has been limited because Solidarity was banned but has included basic printing and office supplies. Now, <PERSON> Hardesty </PERSON> said, the federation and a number of its member unions were interested in providing Solidarity with additional financial support and equipment as it works to recruit members and support candidates in elections.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday for authority to give away weapons to help <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION> armies fight drug traffickers. Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said weapons furnished without charge would be `` excess defense articles.'' He told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that they would be given to military forces in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. He said the administration is asking $ 21 million for the purpose in the year that begins Oct. 1, beyond the present spending level. `` The biggest increase in this group is for <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, where the activities of drug barons and insurgent groups, sometimes working together, threaten the very survival of the legal system and democratic government,'' he said. He added that the next largest increase would go to <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> because it is in a similar situation, and there would also be increases for <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> and the eastern <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. Drug traffickers often use <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> islands as relay points for drugs from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. His prepared testimony did not mention <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, another major source of narcotics. Nor did it list the arms to be given under the new program. The `` intention would be to make equipment available at the low-tech end of the spectrum, -LRB- that is -RRB- basic military equipment suitable for use in low-intensity conflict against drug traffickers,'' he said. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts at cooperation had been mostly with local police, with occasional use of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military transport. `` We believe that local military forces are ready to and must take a larger role in these efforts,'' he added. `` They are the only forces large enough to do it; they have the infrastructure; they can act as a disciplined and trained force, and it is far better that they take this role rather than <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> combat forces.'' At home the Pentagon has resisted any move to have its forces take part in drug arrests or investigations, though it cooperates in the battle against narcotics by lending its equipment to law enforcement agencies. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said that in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the armed forces need <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> money for equipment, training and support if they are to do more against drugs. `` This is not to say that the military can supplant the local police forces, but they have a role to play,'' he added. He noted that the Colombian and Peruvian forces are also fighting insurgents who have roots and objectives independent of drug dealers, though he said there are tactical alliances between them.

<HEAD>EPA Proposes to Limit Drinking Water Pollutants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> proposed on Tuesday to limit the maximum amounts of 38 types of cancer-causing chemicals and other pollutants found in drinking water, a move that will cause increases in household water bills. But the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said it ca n't meet a congressional deadline on two dozen other water pollutants because it is short of money and staff. The 38 chemicals, including many widely used pesticides and other highly toxic carcinogens, must be monitored and kept below the required levels in all public drinking water under the EPA regulations issued Tuesday. The rules will be made final after a period for public comment. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> office which deals with drinking water contaminants, said most public water systems already meet the proposed requirements, but additional purification equipment will probably be needed in about 2,500 public systems, most of them in rural areas. In some cases, a household water bill could go up as much as $ 460 a year, although the increase will generally be much lower, <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said. The additional costs will chiefly be because of equipment. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> estimated that the cost of public water in areas where additional pollution controls are required could increase from $ 10 to $ 460 a year, depending on the size of the water system and the contaminant and treatment technology involved. The water systems likely to be in violation of the federal standard will account for roughly 3 percent of all the water systems in the country and provide water for 2 million people, said <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>. Private wells are not covered by the regulations. <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said that when the regulations, covering 17 pesticides and 21 other pollutants, take effect, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> will have established maximum allowable levels for 55 of 83 dangerous drinking water contaminants singled out for action by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> nearly three years ago. Many of those federal standards probably will not go into effect for another year or more, however. Three years ago, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> told the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to establish federal standards on all 83 pollutants by June 1 of this year, but <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said the agency wo n't be able to meet the deadline on the 28 remaining chemicals. He said the process is expected to take another year as maximum safe levels and water treatment techniques for each of the remaining contaminants are worked out. `` If we had more money and manpower we could have sped those -LRB- calculations -RRB- up,'' said <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, blaming agency budget constraints and staff shortages for not being able to meet the deadline. The proposed standards cover 17 pesticides including alachlor, aldicarb and atrazine, which are widely used in agriculture; 11 synthetic organic chemicals that have been found to cause cancer or damage to the nervous system; and eight inorganic chemicals, including asbestos, mercury, cadmium, nitrates and nitrites; and two chemicals used to treat drinking water. The regulations also will require local water officials to monitor the chemical levels in their water supply, at times as frequently as every three months, and to make public those occasions when the federal standards are exceeded. While most of the nation's water supply is already thought to be in compliance with the federal standards, <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said about 2,500 small, mostly rural water systems likely will violate the regulations unless they install additional equipment. Officials operating about 80,000 water systems likely will have to increase monitoring activities to comply with the federal rules. The requirements `` are important steps in the continuing effort to assure that Americans have the safest drinking water in the world,'' said <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>. But some <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> critics maintained that the regulations, while slow in coming, are also too weak. <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, an attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said the maximum levels required by the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> is significantly higher than ceilings already required by a number of states. Furthermore, she said, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> is lifting some water pollutant standards, including the ones for aluminum and silver. Both pose health risks, she said.

<HEAD>Damaged Gun Turret Can Be Fixed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A team of <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> specialists has concluded that the gun turret aboard the battleship <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> damaged in last month's deadly explosion can be repaired, but no decision has been made to do so, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s chief spokesman, said a 35-member <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> damage control team began its work aboard the battleship last week by determining that the materials and expertise are available to repair the turret. The answer to that basic question had not been clear in the immediate aftermath of the April 19 tragedy because of the vessel's age The <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> was commissioned in 1943 during World War II and no vessel of its type has been built since that war. Forty-seven sailors died in the explosion inside the No. 2 gun turret while they were loading a 16-inch gun with powder. The fact that repairs are technically feasible, however, does not mean the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has decided to make repairs, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. No cost estimate has been developed yet nor is any estimate available on how long such repairs might take, he said. The <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s skipper, Capt. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON>, has said the vessel would be ready for battle even if the damaged turret was never repaired. The huge battleship still has two other turrets, each with three 16-inch guns. `` Preliminary examination indicates that it can be repaired,'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` But there are a lot of factors that go into -LRB- a final decision -RRB-. `` It's too early yet to give you either a cost estimate or the amount of time it would take to make repairs. All I can give you is the preliminary judgment that they can repair it.'' The spokesman said one of the first indications repairs might be feasible came recently when the huge guns above the damaged turret were swung back on centerline, using their own internal machinery. In related developments, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said the battleship had been moved to a new anchorage near <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, to unload the gunpowder and shells from the damaged turret. `` You may recall that as part of the safety procedures, they flooded the magazine on the ship immediately following the explosion. Now they have to take out the powder and projectiles to examine them and see if they were damaged by the water.'' The spokesman also said he had investigated, but could not confirm, a published report that one of the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s victims issued a terse verbal warning that there was `` a problem'' just before the blast. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday a crew member reportedly made the comment over a sound-activated phone circuit just before the explosion, saying: `` Uh, oh. We've got a problem here.'' `` I ca n't get any corroboration for that story,'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. `` I just do n't know.''

<HEAD>Probe Into Aborigine Deaths Looks At Why More Go To Jail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government Tuesday broadened a probe into the deaths of aborigines in police custody to discover why proportionately more of the native people than other Australians end up in jail. The <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inquiry </ORGANIZATION> said it was concerned by government statistics that show aborigines, about 1 percent of the 16 million population, are six times more likely to go to jail than white Australians. `` While investigation of aboriginal deaths in custody is important, so too is learning the lessons of the past and acting to prevent further deaths,'' said <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, who is heading the inquiry. <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, a lawyer, this week replaced judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Muirhead </PERSON> on the commission, which was established by Prime Minister <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> in mid-1987. <PERSON> Muirhead </PERSON>, in an interim report issued in December, urged states to abolish drunkenness as a criminal offense, indicating this was perhaps a chief reason aborigines were arrested. In February, the government pledged the equivalent of $ 8 million to set up drying-out facilities as an alternative to jail for people arrested on drinking charges. The commission is investigating the deaths while in police custody of 104 aborigines between 1980 and May 31, 1987.

 Two couples checked in at <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> lottery headquarters Tuesday to claim a share of a North American record jackpot of $ 115.5 million, leaving only one of the 14 winning tickets unaccounted for. The 12th and 13th ticketholders included a naturalized American couple from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> and <PERSON> Typin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> of </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> suburb. They said they would use their winnings to educate their three children and quit their jobs. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> said he would `` invest the money and live comfortably for the rest of my life.'' Also presenting a ticket from the April 26 drawing were <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> and <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Novotny </PERSON>, both 46, of the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Malvern </LOCATION>. They refused to talk with reporters. Lottery spokeswoman <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said the Novotnys had bought 50 tickets and let the computer pick the numbers. <PERSON> Novotny </PERSON> would not tell lottery officials where he worked. Each winning ticket is worth $ 8.3 million, to be paid in 26 annual installments of $ 317,524.67 before taxes. The remaining ticket holder has until April 26, 1990, to claim a share of the Super 7 prize. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> said he will leave his job as a mechanical engineer at the <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yard </ORGANIZATION>, where he has worked for 27 years. He said his wife already quit her job at a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> restaurant. Both are 56 and came from <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> has been in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since 1947 and his wife has been here since 1950. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> said he waited until Tuesday to come forward because he wanted to check with a lawyer and plan what to do with the money. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> said he bought 30 tickets and let the computer pick the numbers. He usually spends $ 5 a week on the lottery. Ms. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said validation of the winning tickets should be completed later this week, and the first checks presented next week. Other unofficial winners in the jackpot so far include 14 workers from a <LOCATION> Windham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, brick factory; a 74-year-old widow from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, and a chiropractor and his wife from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brighton </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Democrats Launch Drive to Wean Farmers From Pesticides, Fertilizers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> launched a campaign Tuesday to wean American farmers from dependence on pesticides and fertilizers, arguing that new practices are needed to protect food and water from chemical contamination. The centerpiece of their effort is legislation sponsored by Sen. <PERSON> Wyche </PERSON> <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>, D-Ga., and endorsed at a news conference by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, Sen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and 23 farm and environmental <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>, chairman of the agriculture subcommittee on conservation and forestry, said the goal is to provide, through the 1990 farm bill, programs to give incentives to farmers who voluntarily reduce reliance on chemicals. `` There have been methods, time proven for 3,000 years, where a proper combination of conservation practices, stewardship practices, crop rotation practices, along with an appropriate use of chemicals and fertilizers ... have proven effective,'' he said. The legislation would require that the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> inform farmers about advances in low-input farming, integrated pest management and any other practice reducing reliance on chemicals without sacrificing production. It also would remove existing disincentives in federal farm programs that prevent farmers from taking advantage of new, low-input farming methods, and it would provide incentives to encourage farmers to make the transition from an overreliance on chemicals to low-input methods. `` For too long, industry and agriculture policies have promoted practices that degrade our natural and agricultural resources and pose threats to the health of our people,'' <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> said. `` We have already waited longer than we should to reverse this trend and restore <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> agriculture to a safe, sound course for the future.'' Both <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said they expect farmers eventually will support the legislation, even though the transition might initially reduce crop yields and profits. `` Farm families will benefit from this bill,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. `` By helping to reduce pesticide use, this legislation will help protect the quality of drinking water in rural areas.'' The bill would create a drinking water well-testing program to detect contamination by pesticides or nitrates. In areas where testing finds contamination, federal aid would be provided to help farmers establish groundwater protection plans. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said encouraging farmers to reduce use of pesticides and fertilizers also will help protect the nation's food supply. `` While the vast majority of our food products are free of pesticide contamination, we must do everything we can to expand and improve our food quality programs,'' he said. `` This bill will take us in that direction.''

 Corrosion of the nuclear reactor aboard a Soviet submarine that sank off <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> April 7 may eventually lead to the release of huge amounts of radioactivity, the environmental group <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. The group said a study done for it by <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Large </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, a nuclear engineering consulting firm in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, concluded that the submarine may release up to 20 million curies of radioactivity if the vessel is not recovered. That is equal to about one-third of the radiation released by the April 1986 explosion at the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear power plant in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> said. Thirty-one people died in the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> accident. The Soviet submarine caught fire and sank in 5,000 feet of water off northern <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s trip to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this week puts the spotlight back on the Canada-U.S. free trade agreement while his government faces heated debate over efforts to cut the budget deficit. He receives an award Wednesday in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> from the private <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, in large part for his role in leading <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> to sign the sweeping trade agreement that eases investment barriers and phases out all remaining tariffs between <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> over the next decade. On Thursday, he visits the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, where he will meet with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for the second time this year. The talks are expected to concentrate on the trade pact and acid rain, always a major topic in Canadian-U.S. relations. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> led his <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to a second consecutive majority government last fall in a campaign dominated by the issue of whether to proceed with the trade agreement he signed in January 1988 with President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. With <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s victory clinching the way for the pact to take effect as scheduled Jan. 1, the attention of the prime minister and other senior officials turned to the budget deficit, which is higher per capita in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> than in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. His opponents, who charged that free trade would force <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> to cut its traditional network of social protection for its population, now say the election did not give <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> a mandate to tackle the soaring public debt. `` It is a full-scale, all-out assault on the weak, the poor, the disadvantaged, the dispossessed,'' <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said after the budget for the 1989-90 fiscal year was released last week. `` This budget is proof that nothing they said, nothing the prime minister committed himself and his government to during the last election, is true,'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said. The budget raises taxes and cuts federal spending in areas from the military to rail service and child care plans, although it still leaves a deficit of $ 25.6 billion. Among the most unexpected steps was the elimination of the controversial program to spend $ 6.7 billion for a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines. The prime minister has said repeatedly that the effort to bring the deficit under control is critical to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s future. `` Only by measures to reduce the burden of the debt can Canadians avoid a repetition of the excessive unemployment and inflation rates of the early 1980s,'' he wrote in the speech that opened the new session of Parliament last month. The debt now stands at $ 273 billion after the government ran a $ 25.2 billion deficit in the 1988-89 fiscal year. The amount is about 5 percent of gross domestic product, about double the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ratio. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> his first foreign stop after his inauguration with a half-day visit to meet with <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> in February. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> leader promised to move quickly with congressional legislation to control acid rain, which <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> blames for killing 14,000 lakes in the eastern part of the country. The two nations are each other's largest trading partner, with two-way trade amounting to more than $ 150 billion annually.

<HEAD>Report Says Half of America's Children Take Medicines Improperly.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Nearly half of the nation's children are taking or being given medicines improperly, according to a report Tuesday that called the misuse `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s other drug problem.'' The report by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patient </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> said parents, physicians and pharmcists must communicate better about safe and effective use of medicines, and children must be educated about the importance of taking prescription and over-the-counter medicines properly. Health Secretary <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, who joined council officials at a news conference, endorsed the council's campaign to educate health care providers, parents and schools about the problem. Studies show that 46 percent of the time, `` children, or their parents, are either administering too much of a medicine, stopping the medication too soon, not taking enough or the medicine or not taking the medicine at all,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. This misuse is occurring not only for minor afflictions but for serious illnesses, including cancer, kidney disease and other chronic conditions, he said. The conditions for which medicines are most likely to be administered improperly are asthma and epilepsy, the two most common chronic diseases for which children take medication, <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. The report said studies have shown that up to 4.6 percent of pediatric hospital admissions are related to medicine use, and up to 44 percent of those problems are severe or fatal. In a typical two-week period, 13 million children take medicines prescribed or recommended by a physician, said the report, titled `` Children and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Other Drug Problem.'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said the misuse of medicines is `` a major problem in the health care of children,'' but requiring package inserts for prescription medicines with specific directions for use would probably not help. Detailed directions already included in over-the-counter medicines have n't improved compliance, he said. `` This is everybody's problem,'' said <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. `` There's a lot of parental responsibility, physician responsibility, and I do n't want to leave out the pharmacists ... and the media focusing on this as well. `` I do n't think a simple package insert will solve the problem,'' he said. `` This is an attitudinal and behavior problem in the whole health care system.''

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is discussing with the troubled West German government a potential compromise to the dispute over short-range nuclear missiles that involves development of a non-nuclear West German rocket, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said Tuesday. The missile could target airfields and other <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact military installations now covered by the nuclear-armed Lances that Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> is trying to persuade <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> to scale back and eventually eliminate. The West German government decided in February to suspend research and development of the FK90, which is classified as a tactical weapon with a range below 300 miles. But in seeking a compromise in the dispute over the <LOCATION> Lance </LOCATION> missile, going ahead with the German missile is under discussion, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Gen. <PERSON> Henning </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Ondarza </PERSON>, the commander-in-chief of the West German army, is in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> holding talks at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on options intended to ease the strains in the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has lined up with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in trying to persuade <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> to agree to expand the range of the aging <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> and to drop his demand for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiations with the Soviets on reducing short-range nuclear weapons. <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> and other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> countries are siding with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The non-nuclear missile, known also as <PERSON> Technex </PERSON>, was supposed to be co-produced with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gro </PERSON> <PERSON> Harlem </PERSON> <PERSON> Brundtland </PERSON>, the prime minister of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, is visiting <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and said she would discuss nuclear issues with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> when they meet Wednesday at the White House. `` I think what we need now is to look for the common ground, look for what will be a sensible and coherent way of handling the issues of both arms control and disarmament,'' she said Tuesday at a news conference. Failure to heal the rift could cloud <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s summit meeting in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> May 29-30 with the leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> countries. Another option is to have <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> make unilateral cuts in its short-range nuclear weapons while challenging the Soviets to meet the lower levels, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> officials said. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> is already retiring tactical nuclear artillery weapons. Cutting back on the Lances _ after the range of the missile is more than tripled to about 250 miles _ was suggested in a recent study by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>, the alliance's supreme military commander in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The idea was quietly proposed to <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s government several weeks ago, but the chancellor persisted in demanding a delay in modernizing the Lances for three years and speedy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiations with the Soviets over them, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, who is up for re-election next year, is under considerable political pressure from a West German electorate with growing concern over the concentration of nuclear weapons in the country. The development of a non-nuclear missile might ease some of those pressures and also permit <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> to get by with fewer Lances, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said. In <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> official who insisted on anonymity said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal for unilateral reductions after the Lances are made more potent was designed `` for a working document for how to proceed on the issue.'' Presumably it would be taken up by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the other allied leaders at the summit meeting. The Western nations are trying to present a united front while Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> carries out unilateral cuts in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> defense spending and armored divisions and troops in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration considers <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s initiatives and the inroads they appear to be making in West European public opinion one of the biggest challenges to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign policy. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> defense ministers, at a nuclear strategy session last month, gave only lukewarm backing to the Lance modernization program, saying nuclear forces `` must be kept up-to-date where necessary.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Defense Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said he was satisfied with the endorsement and was `` reasonably confident'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would provide more money to continue development of the new generation <PERSON> Lance </PERSON>. There are currently 88 Lance launchers, most of which are based in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Officials have said the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> outnumbers <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> by about 12-to-1 in short-range nuclear missile launchers. The alliance contends it needs to maintain its nuclear stockpile to balance a superiority the East has built up in conventional arms. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the seven <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact countries began talks in March on cutting conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is reviewing its policy on boarding foreign vessels on the high seas after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel were barred for three days from searching a Taiwanese ship suspected of illegal salmon fishing, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said Tuesday. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s ambassador for oceans and fisheries, told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee that an inter-agency task force was examining the policy, which allows for the boarding of a foreign vessel only after receiving permission from the government whose flag the ship flies. `` Because of the recent incident invovling <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, we are reviewing our high-seas boarding policy,'' <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> said. `` I am confident we will come up with something.'' <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has jurisdiction over such fish as salmon that were born in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> waters and return there to spawn after several years in the ocean. `` The problem is what we do with that jurisdiction,'' <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> said during a hearing before the fisheries, wildlife conservation and environment subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> said the present policy is based on `` customary international law'' and in a brief interview after the hearing declined to discuss possible alternatives. `` We are exploring various possibilities,'' <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> said. Northwest lawmakers said that fishermen in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> are becomming increasingly angry over what the illegal catch of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> salmon by foreign driftnet fleets from <LOCATION> Tawian </LOCATION>, South Korean and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> Republican Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said the only way to get the attention of the three countries with driftnet fleets would be to impose trade sanctions. Coast Guard Rear Adm. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> told the subcommittee that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel who boarded the Taiwanese vessel in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> last month found `` no conclusive evidence'' it had been illegally fishing for salmon. The cutter <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON> shadowed the Taiwanese ship for more than 700 miles before <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> personnel were given permission from the government of <LOCATION> Tawian </LOCATION> to board. Efforts to find the ship's net, which was abandoned after the vessel was first spotted by the <PERSON> Jarvis </PERSON>, were unsucessful. Under various diplomatic agreements, driftnet fishing has been limited to areas well away from the migration routes of salmon. Since <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> enacted a law in late 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has been trying to negotiate driftnet monitoring and enforcement agreements with each of the three countries. If such agreements are not concluded by June 29, the president can then impose trade restrictions on imports of fish products from those countries. American fishermen claim that vessels from <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> are using driftnets to illegally snare millions of tons of salmon under the guise of squid fishing. Fishing groups have said the illegal fishing has already affected salmon runs in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. An estimated 700 fishing boats from <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> use driftnets, which can stretch 35 miles in length and cover more than 30,000 square miles of ocean on any given day. Environmentalists have likened driftnet fishing to clear cutting a forest and charge the nets are responsible for the deaths of thousands of porpoises, seals, seabirds and other marine life annually.

<HEAD>Conference Asks Total Ban on Ozone-Destroying CFCs by Century End</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATTI HUUHTANEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HELSINKI, Finland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A world conference demanded on Tuesday a total ban on production of ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons by the end of the century. The representatives from 86 countries also asked for an international fund to help Third World countries replace environmentally hazardous equipment. The resolution adopted at the U.N.-sponsored conference advanced the timetable of the 1987 <ORGANIZATION> Montreal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protocol </ORGANIZATION>, which requires industrial nations to cut production of chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, to half of 1986 levels by 1999. The declaration said developing countries should be helped in finding and financing alternatives to CFCs, which are used in refrigeration, cleaning, aerosol cans and other industrial products. The resolution was drafted by <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> and was accepted with unexpected speed on opening day of a scheduled four-day meeting of government ministers and experts, which was called to bring the <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> document up to date. The ozone layer ranges from nine to 18 miles high. It is the atmospheric layer within the stratosphere in which an appreciable concentration of ozone gas occurs, absorbing much ultraviolet radiation and preventing some heat loss from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. Scientists say the destruction of the ozone layer is causing increased skin cancer and eye damage and poses a danger to the world's food chain. Environmentalists said depletion of the ozone layer is occurring at a much faster rate than foreseen when the Montreal Protocol was signed. Finnish President <PERSON> Mauno </PERSON> <PERSON> Koivisto </PERSON> said in his opening speech, `` The industrial nations must spend much more on new technologies and be prepared to transfer applicable technologies and knowhow to the developing countries.'' As the conference opened, police detained six <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> protesters outside the hall. Members of the environmental group from <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> had illegally placed a banner reading `` Ozone Destroyers _ 100 Percent Halt Now'' on flagpoles outside Finlandia Hall, police said. They were later released. The closed-door conference opened in disarray when the draft declaration was leaked to reporters before delegates had a chance to discuss it. The declaration called for agreement to phase out the dangerous gases listed in the Montreal Protocol `` as soon as possible, but not later than year 2000, and for that purpose to tighten the timetable of the Montreal Protocol.'' It urged all nations to join the 36 countries and the 12-nation European Community that have ratified the document signed in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> called for creation of an international climate fund under <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> auspices to make new technologies available to developing countries. <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s environment minister, <PERSON> Sissel </PERSON> <PERSON> Roenbeck </PERSON> said her country would allocate to the fund 0.1 percent of its gross national product, or about $ 88 million, provided other industrialized countries do the same. The annual production of CFCs is 1.14 million tons, two thirds of which is produced by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> produces about 12 percent of CFCs and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> an estimated 10 percent. Differences between East and West on the causes of ozone depletion were resolved at a separate meeting of scientists and government officials last week, delegates said.

 Consumer activist <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> on Tuesday said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` should not be allowed to forget'' the Alaskan oil spill and called for a consumer boycott of the giant oil company's products <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> joined representatives from several environmental and consumer groups in denouncing <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> for its failure to be prepared for and rapidly respond to the oil spill that has fouled hundreds of square miles of pristine water and shoreline along <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s southern coast `` Exxon should not be allowed to forget this oil spill,'' said <PERSON> Nader </PERSON>, suggesting <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> and the entire petroleum industry must be made aware of public outrage over the spill. `` Americans can take action now by voting with their steering wheel and dollars against all <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> products,'' <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> said at a news conference called in connection with a protest against the oil company in several cities across the nation. An <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that more than 10,000 Exxon credit cards have been turned in since the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> spill, but he could not speculate on how the spill has affected Exxon sales. There are about 7 million Exxon credit cards in circulation, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. Other groups represented at the press conference included <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION>, a consumer organization that often deal with petroleum related issues; the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a coalition of three environmental groups; <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, both advocacy groups founded by <PERSON> Nader </PERSON>; and <ORGANIZATION> Clean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION>, an environmental group. <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackwelder </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voters </ORGANIZATION>, a lobbying organization that represents a variety of environmental groups, suggested that a successful boycott of Exxon products would also send a message to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` From the original authorization of the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil pipeline in 1973 ... to the current state of affairs in which Exxon is making taxpayers and consumers pay for its negligence, the damaging role of big oil's big money in <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> politics is all too apparent,'' said <PERSON> Blackwelder </PERSON>. Before a boycott is ended, the consumer and environmental groups said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> must pay all damage and cleanup costs from the spill into <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>; establish an additional $ 1 billion trust fund for environmental protection in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>; promise to conduct no oil drilling in the <ORGANIZATION> Arctic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION> if it's opened for oil and gas development; and pay for development of safer oil tanks and better spill contingency programs. Although oil industry leaders have said rising gasoline prices are not directly related to the spill, <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> called on <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> to roll back recent price increases.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said Tuesday that some of the Alaskan oil spill will have to be left to the cleansing forces of nature, but he said an all-out cleanup effort still is needed. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, who is to make his second trip to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> Wednesday as overall coordinator for cleanup of the March 24 oil tanker spill, said he expected forces involved in the effort to double or triple in size by the end of the month. In a speech at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> called the spilling of 11 million gallons of crude oil into Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> `` the most significant environmental disaster this nation has ever faced.'' But he said the cleanup operation, to be paid for by the oil industry, could add $ 100 million to $ 500 million to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s economy, which he said is more than the effect of the fishing industry. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said he would reserve judgment on <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s latest plans for the cleanup, which include burning and burying recovered sludge and leaving some lightly soiled beaches to the cleansing forces of nature. The plan requires the approval of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> commandant, Adm. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yost </PERSON>, who criticized some aspects of it Tuesday as thin. The transportation secretary, who oversees the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, said he would decide within a week whether to approve the plan. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said that on some beaches, `` nature will do its work,'' but he said the state and <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> will have to focus all summer on cleaning up as much as possible. `` My position is that we ca n't do enough -LRB- cleaning up, -RRB-'' he said. `` If it's anywhere close to being a viable opiton, we ought to do it.'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> cautioned against cleanup efforts that may do damage to the environment, but did not point to any specific plan of <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>. `` When you are dealing in an area that is remote and has a lot of nature at work, you want to be sure you do n't cross the line,'' he said. `` The oil industry will have to demonstrate that it is capable of cleaning up its mess,'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said. `` If they do n't, it will be very difficult for them to develop domestic reserves.'' The secretary said he was traveling to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> with officials from the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, White House and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.

 A masked gunman burst into a gift shop Tuesday and critically wounded <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s personal representative to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, police said. <PERSON> Issam </PERSON> <PERSON> Salem </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s top official in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, was in critical condition and undergoing surgery to remove a bullet from his head, doctors said. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> met with <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, initially said <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION>, 48, died in the attack. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> later said <PERSON> Salem </PERSON> was in a coma. `` We must not let ourselves be terrorized by this incident but do all we can to put into effect the Arab resolutions on <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said, referring to an Arab League call for a truce in the country's 14-year-old civil war. The latest outbreak has pitted Christian forces against an alliance of Syrian soldiers and Druse Moslem militiamen. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said he thought the shooting was `` a message for us to put up our hands and stop helping our <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> brothers.'' The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief, who has longstanding differences with <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, had voiced support for the Christians in the current fighting, which police say has killed 278 people and wounded 1,010. A police spokesman in <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, a port city 25 miles south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, said the attack came after <PERSON> Salem </PERSON> got out of his white Mercedes and entered a gift store on Fakhreddine Street. His two bodyguards waited in the car. `` A lone assailant, wearing a plastic mask, stormed into the shop shouting ` <PERSON> Issam </PERSON> <PERSON> Salem </PERSON>.' When <PERSON> Salem </PERSON> turned to face the gunman, he fired two 9mm bullets into <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION>'s head and shoulder and escaped,'' said the spokesman, who can not be identified under police rules. The bodyguards chased the gunman but he disappeared in the narrow alleys leading to <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilweh </PERSON> refugee camp, the spokeman added. <PERSON> Salem </PERSON> was taken to <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Hammoud </PERSON> hospital, where he underwent surgery to remove the bullet that pierced the left side of his forehead. `` He stands a 50-50 chance of making it, but even if he does he will be suffering from a neurological defect,'' said one of the surgeons, Dr. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Mansour </PERSON>. `` That means possible partial paralysis.'' The police spokesman said there was no immediate information on the gunman's identity. It was the second assassination attempt in four days against a senior <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> aide in <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Zeid </PERSON> <PERSON> Wehbi </PERSON>, the official spokesman of <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla faction, escaped assassination Saturday when a rocket-propelled grenade was fired at his house, wounding two passers-by. He was not home at the time. There was no claim of responsibility for either attack. A senior <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> official, without making specific accusations, said the attacks on <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Wehbi </PERSON> apparently were linked. `` The rapid succession of the two attempts indicates an organized intelligence apparatus was out to eliminate <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s men,'' said the official, who declined to be identified <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> is married to <PERSON> Jihad </PERSON> <PERSON> Salameh </PERSON>, a sister of the late <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Salameh </PERSON>, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s personal security chief who was assassinated by a remote-controlled bomb in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Jan. 19, 1979. Mrs. <PERSON> Salem </PERSON> sat weeping at the hospital and refused to talk to reporters. About 5,000 <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas who returned to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in recent years are based in <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> was evacuated from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1982 following the Israeli invasion. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s faction has many enemies apart from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Among them is Fatah-Revolutionary Council, a breakaway group led by terrorist <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>, which has bases in the <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> <PERSON> El-Hilweh </PERSON> camp. Other anti-Arafat groups include the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> led by <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jibril </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Fatah-Uprising </ORGANIZATION> faction headed by breakaway PLO Col. <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON> <PERSON> Mousa </PERSON>. All three factions have denounced <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist in December and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s ensuing talks with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 Opponents complained of voting irregularities, but it was clear Tuesday that most Paraguayans were solidly behind the general who overthrew dictator <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>. Official returns gave Gen. <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> nearly three-fourths of the vote for president in Monday's election, and his <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> won firm control of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` Half the vote for <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> was a ` thank you' for overthrowing <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Aldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuccolillo </PERSON>, editor of the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> Color. His paper resumed publishing in March, five years after <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s regime closed it. <PERSON> Susana </PERSON> <PERSON> Jara </PERSON>, a 50-year-old fruit vender at the <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION> public market, said: `` After 35 years of dictatorship, you could not expect any other result because the people are very grateful to him for putting his life in danger to bring us freedom.'' <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, who has been provisional president since the coup Feb. 3, said Tuesday he was `` pleased and happy that I have the affection of the people and that they showed their confidence in me.'' `` Maybe there were small flaws,'' he said in response to opposition charges of irregularities, `` but our intentions always were the best and we wanted the general elections in <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> to be free and clean.'' Speaking to reporters at the national palace, he said the nine <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> members he appointed immediately after the coup had offered their resignations. He said no decision had been made on the resignations. <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Vera </PERSON>, presidential candidate of the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Febrerista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` In spite of the irregularities, I recognize that he won and, I would say, it was a landslide victory.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> got 178,313 of the 240,379 votes counted for president, or 74.18 percent. <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Laino </PERSON>, a former national deputy who returned from exile after the coup, was second with 43,148 votes, or 17.95 percent, <PERSON> Vera </PERSON> was third and six other candidates divided the remainder, the board announced. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, 65, led by similar margins in unofficial tallies by opposition parties and monitoring groups, also with <PERSON> Laino </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vera </PERSON> running second and third respectively. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> and international election observers saw several instances of questionable, but not illegal procedures. She added, however, that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats saw no pattern of `` centrally directed fraud.'' <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>' coup ousted 76-year-old <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> a year after the dictator won his eighth presidential term. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, also a general, went into exile in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. Voting Monday was for a successor to finish the five-year presidential term and to fill the two houses of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> dissolved after the coup. The elections were the most democratic this South American nation has held in decades. Partial official results gave the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> 156,247 votes, or 66.43 percent, of the 235,203 counted for the 36-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, which has 72 seats. Unofficial tallies gave a similar edge to the <ORGANIZATION> Colorados </ORGANIZATION>, who have been in power since 1947 and were a bulwark of the <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> regime. Under Paraguayan law, the party getting the most votes is awarded two-thirds of the seats in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ 24 in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and 48 in the lower house. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> candidate, has pledged to reform the constitution and electoral law and not to seek reelection. <PERSON> Laino </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vera </PERSON> were elected to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Both headed their party slates for congressional seats in addition to running for president. Flaws cited by international observers and party officials included lack of privacy at some voting stations, ballots for all parties not available everywhere, some registered voters not permitted to cast ballots, indelible ink to prevent multiple voting not always available or applied properly. No official figures on voter turnout were given. The election board acknowledged before the election that the registration list of 2.2 million voters in this nation of 4 million people might contain up to 600,000 extra names. Paraguayans voted in large numbers, often standing patiently outdoors on a drizzly day, chatting and drinking mate, a bitter herbal tea. The president and new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are to be sworn in May 15.

 Legal workers seeking refugee status for Salvadorans declared a small victory Tuesday after a judge ruled that Salvadorans may not be deported from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> before being apprised of their rights. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> issued the preliminary injunction made public Monday after finding the Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> violated his previous order to provide Salvadorans access to legal counsel. `` This is a small victory,'' <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, a paralegal with the Harlingen-based Central American legal advocacy group <ORGANIZATION> Proyecto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Libertad </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday. `` It's a recognition that there is a problem. I think it's significant.'' Both sides in the case said they expect the number of Salvadorans actively fighting deportation to increase as a result of the judge's order. In the injunction, <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> noted that none of 67 Salvadorans deported April 20 from the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> minimum-security <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Isabel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Processing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Bayview </LOCATION> near the Mexican border had lawyers at their deportation hearings. `` The court finds it difficult to believe that each of these individuals learned of and knowingly and effectively waived his or her right to counsel,'' the judge said. The order is part of a 1982 class-action suit accusing the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> of failing to provide Salvadorans access to legal representation. The plaintiffs in March had asked that the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> be held in contempt and ordered to comply. Friday's injunction remains in effect until a May 30 hearing. The 1,471 aliens detained at <LOCATION> Bayview </LOCATION> as of Monday included 495 Nicaraguans, 334 Salvadorans, 194 Hondurans and 173 Guatemalans. `` Basically, it says we wo n't be able to deport any Salvadorans until one of the immigrant rights groups, <PERSON> Proyecto </PERSON> <PERSON> Libertad </PERSON>, has a chance to talk to them as a body,'' said <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> has encouraged groups such as the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> to provide legal representation for Salvadorans and other detainees. Proyecto Libertad eadvocates refugee status for Salvadorans on grounds that they are fleeing war and political persecution. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> deports most Salvadorans, ruling that they are coming to this country for economic reasons only. <PERSON> Proyecto </PERSON> <PERSON> Libertad </PERSON> was designated by the plaintiffs to conduct the legal briefings. Proyecto held its first session Monday night for men at the Port Isabel center. A second session was held Tuesday for the women, he said. `` Even though the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> is slowly complying, the judge recognizes that for several months they have been out of compliance,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, a Proyecto attorney. `` Our concern is that for over two months, over 1,500 people have been deported, many of whom were never advised of their rights, who may have had strong cases,'' he said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have granted refugee status to only six Salvadorans and 78 Nicaraguans in the <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> since Feb. 21. The <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> last month installed cellular telephones for the <LOCATION> Bayview </LOCATION> detainees and added pay phones in an effort to comply.

 Prisoners awaiting trial smashed down walls and flooded cell blocks Tuesday, the third day of a riot against conditions at the <PERSON> Risley </PERSON> holding center in northern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. Chief Guard <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said inmates used torn-off cell doors to break down walls and threw bricks and rubble at guards who tried to intervene. `` It was an orgy of destruction,'' he said. Guards and police with riot gear watched from below as prisoners on the jail roof displayed banners protesting conditions in the 25-year-old center near <LOCATION> Warrington </LOCATION>, 10 miles east of the port city of <LOCATION> Liverpool </LOCATION>. Guards said 55 rioters controlled the roof and two top floors of D-wing and had `` absolutely obliterated'' the top floor of B-wing, smashing all 48 cells. Water damaged an additional 60 cells on two floors below, they said. The riot started Sunday. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>, a recently released prisoner, said the main complaints were overcrowding and `` atrocious food.'' The complex, which also holds women prisoners, was opened in 1964 as a short-stay prison for inmates who could not get bail. Home Office Minister <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogg </PERSON>, who is in charge of prisons, said in a radio interview that plans called for <PERSON> Risley </PERSON> to be completely rebuilt and within eight years it would be an entirely new prison. He called <PERSON> Risley </PERSON> a `` particularly difficult establishment.'' <PERSON> Hogg </PERSON> said the inmates could not be made to work because they were awaiting trial. He said he was satisfied with staffing levels. But <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartell </PERSON>, the guards' national association chairman, said: `` There were 25 staff on duty for 550 prisoners ... We are short of resources and staff and we are afraid that this incident may presage a summer of discontent throughout the prison system.'' After seven suicides in 18 months, Judge <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Tumim </PERSON>, the government chief inspector of prisons, described <PERSON> Risley </PERSON> last summer as `` barbarous and squalid ... a poorly designed institution where many inmates are kept in appalling and unacceptable conditions.'' <PERSON> Tumim </PERSON> said <PERSON> Risley </PERSON> and other prisons built in the 1960s were constructed without cell toilets, just like the Victorian prisons which still hold most of the country's 50,000 inmates. The government began rebuilding <PERSON> Risley </PERSON> after <PERSON> Tumim </PERSON>'s report.

<TEXT>
 Nine anti-abortion protesters have been ordred to pay $ 810,000 in damages and stay away from the house of a doctor who said demonstrators at his home made life miserable for him and his family. State District Judge <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> on Tuesday issued a permanent injunction barring pickets from coming within 400 feet of the home of Dr. <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. On Monday, a jury decided 10-2 that the picketers should pay Aquino $ 810,000 in damages. `` I feel my family will be left alone now,'' <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said. Abortion opponent <PERSON> Cliff </PERSON> <PERSON> Zarsky </PERSON>, one of two attorneys who represented the defendants without a fee, said he will ask for a new trial. Jurors ruled Monday the protests caused mental anguish to <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, his wife, Mercedes, and their four children. Protesters carried placards that suggested <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> was a murderer, but both sides described the demonstrations as peaceful. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> testified his wife suffered from depression and ulcers, that one son was institutionalized and that his three school-age children suffered academically after the picketing began. <PERSON> Zarsky </PERSON>, who said the demonstrators' actions were protected by the Constitution, argued that the pickets broke no laws and felt it was their `` duty to protect unborn children.'' The damages included $ 140,000 in past and future suffering of the couple, $ 170,000 in past and future suffering of the children and $ 500,000 in punitive damages. It was not clear if each defendant would be able to pay the damages. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonilla </PERSON>, said he would pursue the award. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said, however, that he was `` not really interested in the money.'' <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said he has been performing abortions since 1978 and anti-abortionists had picketed his office since 1982. They began picketing at his home in March 1988, the same month the suit was filed. The phone at <PERSON> Zarsky </PERSON>'s office went unanswered Tuesday. The defendants in the case were <PERSON> Eliseo </PERSON> <PERSON> Valenzuela </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Setliff </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Hood </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> <PERSON> Pritchett </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Pritchett </PERSON>, T.C.

<HEAD>Five Potential `Star Wars' Storage Sites Considered</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Star Wars'' program has selected five sites for consideration as the home of an experimental system for storing huge amounts of electrical energy, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. The sites, in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, will now be studied more closely for their environmental suitability and a final decision will be made sometime next year. The Star Wars project is known formally as the Superconductive Magnetic Energy Storage program, or <ORGANIZATION> SMES </ORGANIZATION>, and will involve the construction of huge coils the size of a football field. The idea behind the project is similar to that used by some utilities that have built excess generating capacity by using elevated water reservoirs. The magnetic coils would be designed to hold huge amounts of electricity that can be `` pumped in'' when demand is low, then discharged when needed. The coils would utilize new breakthroughs in fashioning materials that can conduct electricity with little or no loss of current. The Star Wars program is interested in the idea because of the problem of powering large, ground-based lasers that are being studied as one possible defense against nuclear missiles. `` Among the advantages <ORGANIZATION> SMES </ORGANIZATION> has to offer a ground-based laser are instantaneous response for vast power requirements; extremely high energy conversion efficiency; relatively low cost; fuel independence; siting ease; high availability; low maintenance costs, and insensitivity to earthquake and blast,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> identified the five finalist sites as the <ORGANIZATION> Badger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ammunition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Baraboo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Orogrande </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, near the southeastern edite of the White Sands Missile Range; a laser experiment site already set up inside the White Sands Missile Range; a site near <LOCATION> Monahans </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, located about 35 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Odessa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Hanford Reservation near <LOCATION> Richland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> previously had selected two contractors, <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ebasco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, to compete in developing a design for the <ORGANIZATION> SMES </ORGANIZATION>. That Phase 1 work is be completed in May 1990, at which point the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> plans to select one of the two contractors and at the same time select a construction site for the prototype. The Star Wars program is a research program aimed at developing lasers and other exotic weapons that could automatically shoot down any nuclear missiles fired at the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 A passenger bus traveling along a highway Tuesday ran into a mine, killing two people and injuring 13, officials said.

 The jury in the <LOCATION> Oliver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Iran-Contra </LOCATION> trial deliberated for its longest day Tuesday but failed again to reach agreement on the guilt or innocence of the former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide. There has been no word from the jurors about progress in the nearly two weeks since <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> admonished them that `` in order to return a verdict on any aspect of this case it is necessary that each juror agree to the verdict.'' The jury, which is sequestered in a downtown hotel while not meeting, worked nearly 7 -LCB- hours on its 10th day of deliberations, for a total 53 hours. No one outside the jury room knows what is going on inside but the requirement of unanimity for reaching a verdict `` on any aspect'' seems a likely difficulty. `` Your verdict must be unanimous,'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said on April 20 when he sent the jury from the courtroom with orders to begin weighing the case the next day, a Friday. The jurors were told to communicate with the judge only through notes and were told: `` You are never to reveal to any person, not even the court, how the jury vote stands numerically or otherwise on the question of guilt or innocence'' until the verdict is in. In the first three days there were eight notes. They dealt mostly with office supplies _ the jurors wanted legal pads, paper clips and sharpened pencils _ but not with any substance that would give a clue to possible problems in agreeing on a verdict. Juries, especially those that are arguing about a particular point, often ask to have a particular piece of testimony re-read to them, an activity that takes place in open court with lawyers and defendant present. In those cases, spectators have an inkling about why the jury finds it difficult to reach a verdict. The last note from the North jury was sent to the judge a week ago Monday. Since then there has been no communication from the courtroom where the jury sits surrounded by 1,300 pages of documents _ the 363 exhibits introduced in the trial. The sheer volume of those exhibits, the two months of testimony, and the 12 felony charges in the case made it certain that a conscientious jury would take time. But courthouse observers, many of whom had predicted a verdict would be reached last week, now are discussing the possibility that the jurors may be unable to agree on one or more counts. If the jury reported itself deadlocked on all counts, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> most likely would send them back to try again _ until they reported there was no hope of agreement. If they still could not get a unanimous vote on one or more counts, prosecutors would have to decide later whether to bring the charges again. Ten days is not a record; it is not even close. In the federal court in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, a trial of <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hebrews </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 on racketeering charges set a modern deliberation record of 200 hours over 36 days. Meanwhile, a lawyer for 10 news organizations seeking access to a document that the jury was allowed to see filed a memorandum with <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> saying that `` the fact that the document at issue here has been designated classified'' is no reason to withhold it from the public. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> had questioned the right of the news organizations to intervene in the case. Attorney <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyk </PERSON> told <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> that the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and courts of appeal have recognized that the press may `` assert the rights of public access to proceedings and records in criminal cases.'' The document in question is a summary of hundreds of intelligence `` intercepts'' through which the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> tracked a 1985 shipment of Hawk missiles from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Ten years after the May 3, 1979, election that brought <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> to power, most Britons want her to step down soon and think her right-wing revolution has gone too far, according to new polls. But while Britons questioned ahead of Wednesday's anniversary say they do n't like her, the likelihood is they will go on voting for her because they respect the woman who always has led what The Economist weekly calls a `` reluctant nation.'' The Economist noted that virtually throughout Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s tenure, Gallup polls have never registered more than 24 percent support for a basic <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> doctrine: tax cuts rather than increased state spending, particularly on welfare Soundings published Sunday and Tuesday are part of a nationwide assessment of `` Thatcherism'' prompted by the anniversary of the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s triumph over former Prime Minister <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Callaghan </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> government. She took office May 4, 1979. <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s first woman prime minister was elected by a nation weary of strikes and inflation and yearning for strong government to reverse a national decline. She has won two more elections since and is <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s longest continuously serving prime minister this century. In the opinion polls, she scores high for qualities such as determination and courage. Her most popular policies, polls indicate, are curbing trade unions and allowing public housing tenants to buy their homes. Britons see their country as having gained respect abroad, while becoming a more aggressive, violent and selfish society. The leader who determined to wipe out socialism from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> also appears in most polls to preside over a nation that has not taken her message to heart. A Market Opinion and <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> poll published Tuesday in The Independent, a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> daily, indicates only 30 percent of those asked support the notion that `` private interests and a free market economy should dominate.'' According to a <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> poll in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s liberal Observer newspaper, 58 percent of respondents think 10 years of Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> is enough. And 66 percent agree, `` Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> has gone too far in her policies.'' Forty percent of those questioned said they think she should go immediately and 18 percent want her to make way for a successor at least a year before the next general election due mid-1992. But just 7 percent of the 1,040 voters questioned by <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> actually expect Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> to resign in the next few years. And 28 percent apparently ca n't imagine being without her. Asked when they think Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, 63, will retire, they said: `` Never.'' The soundings also indicate a generally subdued reckoning by voters of the <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> revolution. For example, only 37 percent of 1,001 voters questioned by Gallup for the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> said they think that overall <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is now a better place in which to live. And while 67 percent dislike Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> personally, 63 percent respect her. The polls also have most Britons citing soccer hooliganism and street crime to back their belief that the country has become more violent. But in a notable victory for a leader who has spent a decade preaching self-reliance, among other values, most Britons no longer expect the government to put it right. However, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> continues to be the party leader most think makes the best prime minister. She has won big majorities of around 42 percent of the vote while the left-of-center is split. And, when it comes to casting a vote, she ends the first 10 years with a 2 - to 3-point lead over Labor in most polls `` She has lacked the sunny charm that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> brought to his most controversial policies,'' said The Economist. `` Perhaps lots of people had to be made unhappy for the country to face the future with some confidence. Well, they have been _ and it does.''

<HEAD>Cocaine User Convicted of Prenatal Child Abuse</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCKFORD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A woman who was stripped of custody of her child and convicted of prenatal child abuse for using cocaine during pregnancy is a victim of the courts pushing the law to outrageous limits, a lawyer said Tuesday. But a law professor said the conviction Monday in Juvenile Court was likely to be endorsed by doctors because of compelling evidence that pregnant women who use cocaine endanger their unborn babies. Prosecutors said it apparently was the second case in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> this year in which a woman had been convicted of prenatal child abuse because of drug use. Judge <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kapala </PERSON>, who found the woman guilty of prenatal abuse and neglect, said he was forced to `` take a stand'' on the issue of fetus rights after testimony showed she had used cocaine up to a few hours before the birth. The child, in the care of social workers, shows no sign of cocaine addiction or other serious cocaine-related health problems, officials said. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Logli </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Winnebago </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> state's attorney, said the woman faces no jail time or fine because the case was tried only to determine custody of the child. The child, born three months ago, will remain in the care of social workers pending the mother's treatment at a drug rehabilitation center. A hearing May 25 will determine if she is fit to regain custody of the child. Neither the mother nor the child was identified. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON>, an attorney in the state <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s individual rights and responsibilities section, said the judge's ruling will `` allow headline-grabbing prosecutors another opportunity to practice their trade `` If prenatal abuse happens with cocaine, it can happen with alcohol, it can happen with drunken driving, and it can happen with pregnant speeders,'' he said. <PERSON> Kapala </PERSON> rejected the claim that his ruling could apply to pregnant women who smoke or drink. The difference, he said, is that cocaine is illegal. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON>, professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> and a fellow at the university's <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION>, said that `` a lot of medical people will breathe a sigh of relief'' at <PERSON> Kapala </PERSON>'s decision. `` If you have an unborn child inside you, the evidence is overwhelming that using cocaine is a form of abuse and neglect,'' <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Logli </PERSON> said he was considering filing criminal charges against women whose babies die of cocaine addiction. `` We're talking about a very dangerous illegal substance,'' he said. `` We have no choice but to take serious steps to battle it.'' The prosecutor said that the infant's exposure to cocaine puts it at risk of kidney and developmental problems and increases the risk of sudden infant death syndrome. A key element in the case involved the question of whether <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> law covers fetal rights. The mother's attorney, <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Altamore </PERSON>, said the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> juvenile court act defines abuse and neglect of minors but does not address fetuses. State child abuse laws only speak of minors under 21, he said.

 Cambodian Premier <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> reported `` quite big progress'' with resistance leaders on Tuesday in talks to end a decade-long war, but he said the resistance appeared split on key issues. In <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, shells crashed into the largest Cambodian refugee camp in the latest in a recent surge in border assaults, Western relief officials said. Three rounds flew over a border camp known as Site 2, and two shells landed in the camp 30 minutes later, said <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Velde </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Border Relief Operation. No casualties were reported. It was not known who is responsible for the recent shellings. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Velde </PERSON> said 15 shells have landed in the past 10 days near the camp, home to 180,000 refugees. In <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION>, resistance coalition leader Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> and anti-communist faction chief Son <PERSON> Sann </PERSON> negotiated separately with the premier, who said the two faction leaders differed on key issues. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, the largest and best armed faction in the three-party resistance, were not directly represented in <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> said their absence was a consensus decision. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, <PERSON> Son </PERSON> <PERSON> Sann </PERSON> and their aides were not available for comment Tuesday. Both canceled news conferences. <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> did not indicate whether he considered the split a barrier to further progress. He said the talks would resume Wednesday, with further negotiations in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> expressed willingness on Sunday to drop his demand that a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> force supervise the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and keep the peace after <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>'s government was dismantled. <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> `` agreed to maintain the present constitution and make a few more amendments -LRB- to it -RRB-.'' But Son <PERSON> Sann </PERSON> still insists on the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> force, suspension of the constitution and a four-sided coalition government until elections are held, <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> said the first day of talks achieved `` quite big progress if we compare it with the recent and not so recent past. ... We recognize that both of us made concessions.'' <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> agreed to stop receiving military aid from abroad as soon as the Vietnamese troop withdrawal is completed. It was not clear whether <PERSON> Son </PERSON> <PERSON> Sann </PERSON> also agreed to that. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials estimate that 60,000 to 70,000 Vietnamese troops remain in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has promised to withdraw them by the end of September. <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> said the government would invite <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> home to head the government. The 67-year-old prince agreed to return to <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> after Vietnamese forces departed, <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> said. Speaking through an interpreter, <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> said he favors the creation of a <ORGANIZATION> supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> national </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> council </ORGANIZATION>, headed by <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, with leaders of the other three factions as deputies. The council would draft election rules and supervise the election, <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> said. `` Our government will remain only to maintain social order,'' he said. After the votes are counted, his government would be dissolved. The armed forces would remain at the same strength and in the same places until after the elections. Millions have been killed in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> since 1970, when a coup ended <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s 30-year rule. <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> became engulfed in the Vietnam War, and then the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> won a civil war in 1975. The current war erupted when <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in late 1978 and pushed out the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, which was blamed for killing hundreds of thousands of people.

 An abbreviated countdown began Tuesday for launching Atlantis on a once-delayed planetary mission, and the astronaut who will command the flight said, `` This time we're going to see if we can get it right.'' Astronaut <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> and his four crewmates flew here Tuesday afternoon from their training base in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, where they went after their flight was scrubbed Friday just 31 seconds before the planned liftoff. `` Looks like the vehicle's been turned around real well,'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> told reporters. `` We're extremely pleased the folks here at the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> were able to do such a good and quick job getting it ready to go again.''

Liftoff is scheduled for 1:48 p.m. The shuttle will carry into space the $ 550 million <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> probe, a robot spacecraft bound for <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>. It will be the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> planetary mission in 11 years and the first to be launched from a space shuttle. Friday's launch was scubbed because of a short circuit in a fuel pump. Technicians working around the clock replaced the pump and a leaky fuel line in half the time expected and <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> scheduled another launch attempt for Thursday, at least a day earlier than they originally thought they could. Air Force Capt. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Strange </PERSON>, the shuttle meteorologist, said the weather outlook for a Thursday launch was favorable, with only a 30 percent chance there would be a condition that would violate weather constraints. The biggest problem, and it was slight, he said, might be high crosswinds that could be dangerous if Atlantis had to make an emergency landing on a runway near the launch pad. Shuttle test director <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelps </PERSON> said the new countdown was compressed from three days to two by eliminating some `` hold time'' that is built into the countdown in case of problems and by not repeating some tasks completed in the first attempt. The astronauts will release the Magellan six hours after liftoff, and a rocket will hurl it on a 15-month journey to <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>. The 7,600-pound craft will orbit the planet and map its cloud-veiled surface with high-resolution radar.

<HEAD>Quayle Urged to Seek Reversal of Pentagon Decision</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Lawmakers on Tuesday urged Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to try to reverse a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> decision to scale back funding for a futuristic high-speed plane. Nineteen members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said that <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>'s plan to cut the project's fiscal 1990 budget from $ 300 million to $ 100 million and place it under exclusive <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> jurisdiction will result in the plane's demise. The project has been a joint effort of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>. `` <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials have made it clear that withdrawal of DoD support for <ORGANIZATION> NASP </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- National Aerospace Plane -RRB- would ultimately kill the program,'' the seven Democrats and 12 Republicans said in a letter. They said the plane, a transport that could fly around the world in just two hours, is `` a natural product of our intense need to return to the forefront of space technology.'' <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION> determined that the plane is a civilian aviation program. But the lawmakers argued it represents technology that will provide national security `` well into the 21st century.'' `` As vice president, as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and as one who advocates <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> competitiveness in the world, you have a key role in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> technological development,'' the lawmakers wrote <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. `` To cancel the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plane </ORGANIZATION> in 1990 is to ensure our technological mediocrity beyond.'' Signing the letter were Reps. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurdy </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Roe </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Byron </PERSON>, D-Md; <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Flippo </PERSON>, D-Ala.; <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Valentine </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.C. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON>, D-Kan.; <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON>,; <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, R-Pa.; <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Fla </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, R-Mich.; <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, R-Calif.; <PERSON> Denny </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, R-Ore.; <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Elton </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallegly </PERSON>, R-Calif.; <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Inhofe </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Okla </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Shays </PERSON>; <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Fla </LOCATION>.; and <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Rohrabacher </PERSON>, R-Calif

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday began consideration of the fiscal 1990 budget with the kind of enthusiasm usually reserved for getting one's teeth drilled. Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, D-Tenn., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said he disagreed with those who characterize the deficit reduction plan as `` smoke and mirrors, as deception, as sleight of hand, or even worse. `` But I sympathize completely with the frustration behind it,'' he said, as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> began debate on its version of the $ 1.17 trillion spending late Tuesday. `` This resolution simply does n't go far enough. We all know it.'' `` There is something in it for everyone to hate, yet without it we're in big trouble,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Frenzel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, senior Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, testifying in favor of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> plan. Both plans are based on the deficit-reduction agreement announced last month at the White House. The pact claims about $ 28 billion in deficit reduction through limits on federal spending growth combined with revenues from selling government assets, raising fees, and about $ 5.3 billion in still-to-be-negotiated new revenues. The budgets promise to bring the deficit down below the $ 100 billion goal of the Gramm-Rudman law, for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. But critics contend that claim is based on overly optimistic assumptions, and much of the `` savings'' is illusory. `` I believe we are doing a great disservice,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Beilenson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday as that panel prepared to prescribe a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> debate to assure passage of the plan `` The votes are not there'' to do more, lamented Rep. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> He and others said perhaps more could be done next year. House Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., said after a White House meeting that the budget was `` close to what the administration had asked for. He and the Democratic leaders were working to make sure there would be no amendments allowed that would `` upset the whole apple cart.'' `` Obviously, this budget has been heavily criticized,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON>, R-N.M. `` I know of no one who has a better plan.'' Under the White House pact, both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> budgets envision $ 299.2 billion in military spending next year, about the same as the current year. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> would be given total spending authority of $ 305.5 billion, a figure which includes some outlays which stretch past the end of the fiscal year. Foreign aid spending would be set at $ 17 billion. Entitlement programs would be allowed to grow so that individual benefits and their cost-of-living increases would escape cuts. However, a variety of cost-cutting actions _ some of them just bookkeeping changes _ would allow for $ 8.3 billion in total savings from <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>, agriculture, federal pensions, and other entitlements. The White House agreement set an overall spending cap, but not specifics, for non-entitlement domestic programs. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> budget committees took somewhat difference approaches to dividing that pie, with the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> favoring education, health and veterans programs compared to more <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> emphasis on agriculture, energy and law enforcement. In the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the rules committee was limiting amendments and debate so that the package could be completed on Thursday. In the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, the rules allow individual senators the right to offer amendments at any time, but budget supporters were confident the plan would survive essentially intact. `` We'll have substantial help for the cause,'' <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> said. Once the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> complete their budgets, the two chambers must agree on a single resolution. The document then serves as the guide for the annual spending and tax legislation produced by the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Senate Approves King Holiday Commission But Bars Protest Training</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted Tuesday to reauthorize the <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holiday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> after prohibiting the panel from training people in the nonviolent protest tactics which King used successfully in the civil rights movement The 90-7 vote to give the commission five more years of life _ and its first infusion of federal dollars _ ended two days of debate in which Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, a leading opponent of the 1983 legislation creating the King holiday, was beaten in four attempts to weaken the reauthorizing bill. But Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., the bill's sponsor, joined with <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> in an amendment, adopted 96-0, which prohibits the commission from engaging in training activites for protest or civil disobediance campaigns <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said the amendment was not an attempt to stifle information about King's tactics or the civil rights movement and its history. But because the commission now will be receiving federal money, he said, it should not be permitted to engage in such training activities. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> said the commission's 1988 annual report provides evidence it has been training students to wage nonviolent protest campaigns against social injustice. He said the federal government `` has no business encouraging protest movement campaigns, civil disobedience and those sorts of things.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill, which would provide the commission with $ 1.5 million in federal money over five years, must be reconciled with a similar bill the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed last month. The House version makes the commission permanent and authorizes an annual federal appropriation of $ 500,000. The commission was created in 1984 to promote state, national and international activities relating to the observance of the federal holiday in honor of the slain civil rights leader. Its activities previously had been financed with private donations. Before approving the legislation, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 86-11 to defeat a <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> amendment that would have eliminated all federal money for the commission and 92-6 to defeat another <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> proposal to terminate the commission after two years. Another Helms amendment, which would have prohibited the commission from lobbying state and local governments, was defeated 80-19, and <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>' proposal to prohibit the panel from exercising `` direction, control or supervision'' over school curriculum or programs was rejected 91-7. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> accepted one <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> amendment, requiring that the bronze replica of the Declaration of Independence, which was moved from the Capitol rotunda last year to make way for a bust of King, be returned to a place of prominence in the rotunda. Voting against the bill in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> were Sens. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, R-Colo.; <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>; <PERSON> Trent </PERSON> <PERSON> Lott </PERSON>, R-Miss; <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Idaho </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Symms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Idaho </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wyo </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Commission Rules Domestic Industry Harmed by Low-Priced Imports</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> ruled Tuesday that the domestic bearing industry has been harmed by low-priced imports, clearing the way for the final imposition of anti-dumping duties on certain imports from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. In one of the nation's largest anti-dumping cases ever, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will decide the amount of duties that the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> will levy on an estimated $ 531 million in imported bearings from nine nations. In a series of six rulings, the commission found injury to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bearing producers from low-priced imports of ball, cylindrical roller and plain bearings and rejected claims of injury from imports of spherical, needle roller and slewing ring bearings. The action was hailed by the <ORGANIZATION> Torrington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Torrington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, which had filed a petition on behalf of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bearing industry in March 1988 claiming that massive dumping by foreign countries was damaging domestic manufacturers of anti-friction bearings. <LOCATION> Torrington </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said the commission's action `` should help create conditions of fair competition in the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> market.'' He said domestic producers lost an estimated $ 700 million in sales a year because of unfairly priced imports. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said the company was disappointed that not all categories of imported bearings were found to be injuring domestic manufacturers and that <LOCATION> Torrington </LOCATION> `` will not hesitate to take strong action again to challenge additional unfair trade practices that are identified.'' <PERSON> Terence </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney representing the company, said <LOCATION> Torrington </LOCATION>'s petition covered $ 625 million in imports a year, and that the commission's action would result in the imposition of duties on 85 percent of those imports. <LOCATION> Torrington </LOCATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Ingersoll-Rand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, is the nation's largest producer of a range of bearings. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said the ruling was significant because `` for literally thousands of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION>, it will provide employment opportunities in a high-skilled industry.'' He said an estimated 30 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plants had closed and 14,000 jobs had been lost because of unfair competition from abroad. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said that while the <ORGANIZATION> ITC </ORGANIZATION> ruling was the last step before final imposition of duties, the decision still could be challenged in court and that litigation was not unlikely given the hard-fought nature of the case to date. <ORGANIZATION> ITC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> would probably begin collecting duties by the middle of the month. The decision covers certain imports from <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said most of the affected imports were ball bearings, and that the largest share of the imports came from <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. In earlier rulings on the case, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had found final dumping margins ranging up to 212 percent for some imported bearings, meaning that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prices for the imports would have to be raised by that amount to bring them to a fair value. The <ORGANIZATION> ITC </ORGANIZATION> estimated there were 95 domestic producers of anti-friction bearings in 1988, with plants located in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. Anti-friction bearings are used in the aircraft, automotive, machinery and electronics industries. <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunsdale </PERSON> recused herself from all votes on the bearings to avoid any potential conflict of interest, given certain family holdings in affected industries.

<HEAD>Retired British Spy's Memoirs to Name Soviet Mole</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A retired <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> spy writes in his memoirs that <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> intelligence has been irreparably damaged by Soviet agents, and he names another mole among its ranks, The Independent reported Tuesday. <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Bristow </PERSON>'s book, `` A Game of Moles,'' may face the same government ban attempted on former agent <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s book `` Spycatcher.'' <PERSON> Bristow </PERSON> spoke of his memoirs in an interview at his home in <LOCATION> Malaga </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, the newspaper said. He was quoted as saying British intelligence officials already have tried, over a bottle of claret wine, to have him scrap the book or submit it to government censors. <PERSON> Bristow </PERSON>, 73, once was chief of counterintelligence for southwest <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> for MI6, The Independent said. MI6 is <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s foreign intelligence agency. MI5 handles domestic affairs. `` The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and MI6 were equals before,'' the newspaper quoted <PERSON> Bristow </PERSON> as saying. `` Now they're not. The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> does n't share its supersecret stuff with us anymore. Personally I do n't blame them.'' <PERSON> Bristow </PERSON> said he left MI6 in 1954, after his cover was blown by <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Philby </PERSON>, the notorious British traitor-spy, but continued to do occasional work for the agency, The Independent reported. <PERSON> Philby </PERSON>, <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Burgess </PERSON>, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Maclean </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Blunt </PERSON> were upper-class Englishmen who were unmasked in the 1950s and 1960s as Soviet agents. The Independent said that in `` A Game of Moles,'' <PERSON> Bristow </PERSON> claims the late <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Footman </PERSON>, a chief of MI6's political section for central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, also worked for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bristow </PERSON>, the paper said, claims <PERSON> Footman </PERSON> tore up a report written for him in 1951 on <PERSON> Burgess </PERSON>' suspicious activities, fired a <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> agent of <PERSON> Bristow </PERSON>'s who was uncovering <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> plots in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, and buried top-secret files on links between the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> and Communist parties in southern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The paper did not say whether <PERSON> Footman </PERSON> has any family to respond to the allegation, and the Home Office said: `` We do n't comment on security matters.'' The Independent did not say when the book was to be published, but reporter <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Helm </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the book is not yet completed and <PERSON> Bristow </PERSON> is talking with publishers. The government fought a three-year court battle to suppress <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s book, saying it violated the lifelong oath of secrecy taken by intelligence employees. The courts eventually lifted an injunction banning newspapers from serializing `` Spycatcher,'' but its publication in book form remains banned in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, although its publishers can distribute the Australian edition here.

<HEAD>House-Senate Negotiators Reach Quick Agreement; Veto Looms</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> negotiators quickly agreed Tuesday on legislation to raise the hourly minimum wage to $ 4.55 by 1991 and promised to move for swift congressional passage of the bill which President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has vowed to veto. There were 18 areas in which the terms of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bills differed but the conference committee took only about an an hour to complete work, made easier by staff negotiations during last week's congressional recess Fourteen of the differences were worked out between representatives of each chamber's labor committees. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> conferees then met with representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and stripped off four tax-related <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> amendments including a proposal to raise the amount of outside income a Social Security recipient can earn before losing some enefits. Democrats from both the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> conference teams pledged swift final legislative action on the compromise, with a consensus prediction that the bill would reach the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in about two weeks. Between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Labor Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, the administration has vowed more than a dozen times to veto the measure, which has a final minimum wage target 30 cents higher than the president proposed and contains a so-called training wage far more restrictive than the six-month provision demanded by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Sponsors said they had scaled back their bill considerably to meet administration concerns and would go no further without concessions by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` We are hard-pressed to offer any further compromise,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass. Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, even tried to strip the two-month training wage Democrats reluctantly added to their bill in hopes <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would then accept it. `` Unless we can work out a compromise with the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> we ought to dump the training wage,'' <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> said. But he withdrew the attempt after <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrats told him the provision was essential to maintain support among moderate Democrats and a small number of Republicans who voted for the original <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appears to have the votes to sustain a veto but <PERSON> Democrats </PERSON> promised nonetheless to try to override. To assist that effort, the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> is contemplating an advertising campaign in hopes of rallying the public behind the legislation. The federation's governing body also issued a statement Tuesday supporting the legislation The sponsors on both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> side, however, concede <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> likely will win the first confrontation between the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the White House over domestic policy but they have promised to try to send <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> another minimum-wage bill this year if that happens. The final product endorsed by the conferees would raise the hourly minimum from $ 3.35, its level for more than eight years, to $ 4.55 through three increases _ beginning Oct. 1 and ending on Oct. 1, 1991. Both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bills contained those targets. The major issue resolved in conference was the training-wage provision allowing employers to pay some new workers a subminimum wage for 60 days. The House bill allowed a subminimum only for first-time entrants in the job market while the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> language, adopted by the conference, requires once a person held a job at the submininum wage for 60 days he would be no longer eligible for the subminimum even if he changes jobs.

<HEAD>Man With Gun Arrested Outside a Train Station While Diana Was Inside</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CARDIFF, Wales (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police arrested a man with a gun outside a train station in <LOCATION> south </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> on Tuesday while Princess <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> was inside launching an educational project, they said. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> police said they did not believe there was a direct connection between the royal visit and the unidentified 41-year-old man who was arrested behind a sidewalk security barrier outside a pub next to <LOCATION> Cardiff </LOCATION> station. Buckingham Palace said the princess was only told of the arrest after she left the station. Reporters at the station said they believed the weapon was only a gas-powered air pistol. Police gave no details but said the gun was not a fake and the man was likely to be charged. A pub employee said the unshaven man was wearing a long coat and holding a shopping bag when police arrested him. `` Two officers grabbed his arms and they took what appeared to be some kind of pellet gun from one of his pockets. I did n't see what he did to make them suspicious,'' said the witness on condition of anonymity.

 Prices paid by consumers in Third World countries jumped an average 58.3 percent last year, up from 35.7 percent in 1957, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> reported. The average rise in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and 20 other industrial countries was only 3.3 percent, a rise from 2.9 percent. The figures come from a monthly report distributed Tuesday. Inflation figures for the Third World were heavily influenced by <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> _ <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s 682 percent, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s 343 percent and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s 114 percent. These are the Third World's three biggest debtors as well. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> reported a slowdown from last year's 132 percent but <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> were moving up. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s annual rate was over 387 percent in December, and <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s 1,170 percent in January. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> surpassed them all with 10,205 percent for 1988 and an annual rate of just under 24,000 percent in December but the country is too small to count for much in the overall average. There was also a rise of inflation in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, to 11.6 percent from 7.3 percent. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s rate was up beyond 20 percent, compared less than 9 percent in 1987.

<TEXT>
 The outgoing chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> pointed with pride Tuesday to an opening up of competition in broadcasting during the `` seismic change'' of his six years at the agency. In a swan song address to industry executives, <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> ticked off a list of benefits he said broadcasters had received since he joined the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> in 1983. He thanked his audience at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION> convention `` for being courageous soldiers in this battle for freedom'' and for `` unflagging support'' of his policies against critics in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and non-broadcast media. `` Through this period of seismic change ... I have held firmly to the notion of open entry to create a competitive marketplace for the media,'' he said. `` This policy has led to a proliferation of information outlets unimaginable even six years ago.'' The average American home today has access to 25 video channels, he said, and half of all Americans receive at least 28 radio stations. `` We have tried to foster competition at the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> by lowering barriers to entry, and by permitting broadcasters to compete as freely as those with whom they compete _ namely cable,'' <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> said. While saying that more competition can be a double-edged sword for broadcasters, he said the `` competitive genie is out of the bottle'' and `` neither <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> nor the commission will stuff her back in.'' <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> anounced last month he had resigned from the agency where he has been chairman for the past two years but would stay on until his replacement is confirmed. During <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>'s tenure the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> repealed the Fairness Doctrine that required broadcasters to air opposing views in controversial issues. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is expected to vote to reinstate the policy this year, posing a possible veto fight with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> also revised the means by which stations renew their licenses to bar sham competitors who just want money to drop their challenges to licensees. `` No longer will you be held hostage to petitions to deny filed because you refuse to concede to extortion ... nor will we tolerate those who seek to extort cash payments by masquerading as competing applicants,'' <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> said to a round of applause. He also noted the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s decision last year to make sure that a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> standard for high-definition television will not make obsolete the huge investment TV stations have in current equipment. American industry is racing to adopt standards with which to build an HDTV system and stave off the expected appearance in the next couple of years of foreign-made HDTV VCRs and movies. He urged the broadcasters not to delay reaching agreement on an HDTV transmission standard so <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> can `` regain the lead in broadcast technology.'' He also said broadcasters need further protection from the cable TV industry in the form of a requirement that cable systems pay for the over-the-air programs they feed to their subscribers. `` They should no longer be permitted to take the product that you have bought, you have promoted, you have earned and pass it off, without asking, as theirs,'' <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> said to more applause. He said the future holds new challenges for broadcasters: fiber-optic cable and telephone entry into video programming, competition from foreign media, further loss of audience and the shifting of advertising from video to point of sales. He said network affiliates and networks may have to forge stronger bonds, and broadcasters may have to work with cable to survive against global competitors `` In this complex future,'' he said, `` may you have convictions, may you have the courage of your convictions, may you succeed.'' <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>'s address concluded the 67th annual NAB gathering, which was attended by a record 50,136 broadcast executives and exhibitors.

<HEAD>FDA Advisory Panel Urges OK of Drug to Treat AIDS-Related Condition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> advisory committee on Tuesday recommended approval of a drug used to treat an AIDS-related condition that can lead to blindness. The panel of outside experts based its decision on new data that came from several recent studies conducted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and in other countries that found the drug ganciclovir is effective in treating cytomegalovirus retinitis in AIDS patients. This is the second AIDS drug the advisory committee has recommended for approval in two days of hearings. On Monday, the panel recommended approval of the aerosolized version of pentamidine to ward off initial and recurring bouts of pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, which kills 60 percent of AIDS patients. <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> approval of ganciclovir is expected this summer, and approval of aerosol pentamidine is likely within weeks, said an <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> source who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Advocates of programs to fight AIDS have been pushing the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> to move quickly on approving the drugs. Ganciclovir has been widely available to AIDS patients since November when the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> approved use of the drug for treatment of patients who were in the immediate, sight-threatening stage of cytomegalovirus retinitis. In early March, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> made the drug available to patients whose cytomegalovirus infection was in an early stage. The advisory committee recommended against approval of the drug in October 1987, citing the need for more safety and efficacy data. In recommending approval this time, the panel also strongly urged that extensive follow-up studies be conducted after the drug is on the market. The committee specifically recommended a study to determine the drug's proposed use in children and a study comparing ganciclovir with foscarnet, another experimental drug for cytomegalovirus retinitis. The panel also urged a study be conducted to determine whether ganciclovir can be used in patients who are receiving zidovudine, or AZT, which has been shown to prolong survival of AIDS patients. Because the two drugs have similar toxicity, they are n't used together.

 A familiar-sounding voice boomed out over <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> loudspeakers Tuesday evening announcing the end of the business day. It was President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, personally announcing he was going home. It was the first time in anyone's memory that the president, himself, had performed the daily chore. `` Ladies and gentlemen of the press, the president having gone home for the day, there is a lid on,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. A `` lid'' is the term used to tell reporters that no more paperwork or presidential actions are expected. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made the announcement while walking from the Oval Office to his residence in the White House. Noticing a gathering of reporters hanging around the press office, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asked why they were still there. They said they had to wait for him to leave and for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to announce a lid. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asked what a lid was, and a reporter explained the term. Usually a lid is announced by a press aide using a telephone that is hooked up to a White House announcement system. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asked for the telephone and made the announcement himself at 6:40 p.m. EDT. He departed for his quarters as the press cheered his announcement.

The defendant's father, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Sartin </PERSON>, a weapons coordinator for a warship builder, hugged his wife, <PERSON> Jean </PERSON>, and they both wept Tuesday while facing reporters outside their home. He said his family felt `` so terribly sorry'' for the people shot on Sunday. He said he saw his son at a police station, and it was as if `` there are two people down there.'' `` There is our gentle, quiet son, who loves kids, loves animals and loves people. He is just so gentle. ... Then there is another son sitting down there who does n't know what it is all about,'' he said. `` You just can not explain it _ he is not aggressive. He has never had a scrap in his life. He has never been aggressive to anybody. It is completely alien,'' the father said. The couple has an older son, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>, who works as a weapons engineer on the aircraft carrier <ORGANIZATION> HMS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sartin </PERSON> said he had invited his younger son to his clay pigeon-shooting club a few times and he was `` quite a good little shot,'' but they never shot anything live.

 Six white candles, each symbolizing a million lost lives, were lit in the rotunda of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Capitol on Tuesday in a memorial to the six million Jews killed in the Holocaust of World War II. `` Our memories are of the millions who died, and the many, many others who _ though they survived _ carried with them throughout their remaining lives the permanent scars of the horrors they suffered,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kans., himself a wounded veteran of the war With the division flags of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military units that liberated the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> concentration camps posted as sentinels in the background, the <ORGANIZATION> Eisenhower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medal </ORGANIZATION> was presented posthumously to General of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, who was present at the liberation of the <PERSON> Ohrdruf </PERSON> concentration camp in 1945. The medal was accepted by <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>'s daughter, Mrs. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON>, who said that when he returned from the war the first thing the general told his wife was about his visit to the camp, saying he had been `` almost overcome by the stench of death.'' `` Nothing he had seen during the war had prepared him for this horror,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON> said. `` The memory of what he saw stayed with my father all his life.'' The general died in 1981. Speakers at the ceremony noted that construction will begin next month of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> Holocaust Museum near the mall leading from the Capitol to the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Monument. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerhoff </PERSON>, chairman of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>.

He issued an appeal for the donation by governments and individuals of artifacts of the Holocaust period `` so that we can tell the story accurately and powerfully.'' `` This museum will rise like a phoenix from the ashes to be a symbol of remembrance for all Americans,'' Myerhoff said. Each of the six candles were lit by two people, one a member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the other a survivor of the death camps. Later, at a meeting called to present a progress report on fund raising for the museum, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> said the new institution will be a symbol of a certain kind of hope: `` Hope that no other such memorial need ever be built anywhere on the earth.''

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has agreed to move its military headquarters in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> from central <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> to rural areas, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> announced Tuesday. Under an agreement with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, the headquarters and other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases in central <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> will be moved by the mid-1990s, the ministry said. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> wants to relocate the bases to help meet growing demands for new offices and homes in the crowded capital. The Americans promised to move the bases if <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> provides comparable facilities elsewhere. `` The first element of this plan calls for the early return of the <ORGANIZATION> 8th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> golf course during 1990, with the full relocation of the affected forces in -LRB- the -RRB- mid-1990s,'' the announcement said. South Korean officials said they probably will convert the course into a public park. The <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> barracks have been headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> 8th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and other American forces since the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> backed <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in the 1950-53 Korean War. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> officials agree political and economic changes have caused <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to reassess its relationship with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The two sides are negotiating the future of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> wants to revise agreements to secure greater jurisdiction over the 43,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers stationed under a mutual defense pact. A majority of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> support the presence of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers in their country. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say the forces will remain as long as their presence is desired by a majority of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION>. Dissidents and radical students demand the immediate withdrawal of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops, contending they hamper unification with communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> was divided in 1945, when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet soldiers terminated <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s colonial rule at the end of World War II.

Earlier in the day, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee that `` we are pleased that the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on the Judiciary has seen fit to withdraw from an area not only contentious but in my view improper for their consideration _ that is to say the political and ideological views of the prospective nominees.'' <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> also expressed puzzlement at <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s characterization of the role of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> in forging the `` agreement.'' `` I do n't know what to say about <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON>. I am in the peculiar position of being a friend of <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> acknowledged he had discussed the issue and others with <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON>. `` The problem is I did n't realize I was in any negotiation,'' <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> said. The attorney general's statements crediting <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON>'s role in the discussions appeared to be an attempt to mollify conservative opposition to the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> lawyer's anticipated nomination as deputy attorney general. <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON>, whom <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> told the committee is his choice for the job, has been criticized by conservatives for subverting <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration judicial nominees when he chaired the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> panel. The attorney general told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that `` largely through the efforts of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON> ... we have reached agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- that -RRB- they will revert to their prior role in handling judicial assessments and will henceforth ... restrict their examination and assessment only to those areas where they have special expertise.'' The attorney general's aide, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON> `` played a central role'' in mediating the issue and `` in getting the committee to agree to the points raised by the attorney general.'' Told of <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>'s statements, <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said `` it is our understanding based on personal discussions between <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> leaders and top aides to the attorney general'' that the group had agreed to delete the phrase `` except to the extent they may bear upon other factors.'' <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said this understanding was `` based on an exchange of letters ... between the attorney general and the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> last week.'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION>'s judicial screening unit had agreed to restrict its review to judicial competence, temper and integrity. Following the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> defeat of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>'s nomination to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION>'s committee has been the object of criticism, particularly, but not exclusively, from Republicans, that it improperly considers a nominee's political views. <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 that four of the panel's members voted against recommending <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> because of his `` comparatively extreme views respecting constitutional principles.'' But <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> officials deny that ideology or politics are sole factors, except insofar as they might influence judicial candidate's temperament. `` We have never gotten into political ideology, so there is no change,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Raven </PERSON> said, when told of <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s remarks. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s comments about <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON> appeared to be aimed at mollifying Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, and other conservatives who could make trouble for <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON> if he is nominated for deputy attorney general. In an April 17 letter to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> charged when <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON> chaired the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> standing committee `` there is evidence that that committee's evaluations were tainted with ideological bias against conservative nominees selected by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> said that `` careful consideration be given the complaints raised against him.''

 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> were involved in a foiled plot to return exiled King <PERSON> Zahir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> to power, a broadcast report said Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said Afghan rebels prevented the king's return by cutting off <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> airport in southern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in a fierce battle. The independent commercial network did not say when the battle took place. In <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, where the 74-year-old king now lives, his spokesman, Gen. <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wali </PERSON>, said of the report: `` It's absolutely new to me. I know nothing about it.'' ITV quoted the Moslem rebels fighting <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s Marxist government as saying the plan was discussed when <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> met with them during his March visit to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, where major guerrilla groups are based. It said the rebels also believe it was discussed during Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s trip to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> last month, and between <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> and Indian Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said: `` We have n't seen it -LRB- the report -RRB- ourselves, so we're not in a position to comment.'' He spoke anonymously in keeping with British custom. The <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government and some of the moderate, traditionalist rebel groups have tried to work out a role for the former monarch, who has lived in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> since he was ousted in a 1973 coup. But hard-line rebel leaders reject any role for the king in future Afghan governments. The king has said he is willing to help end the fighting but has refused to serve in any Marxist-dominated government.

 A moderate earthquake shook the states of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guerrero </LOCATION> in the pre-dawn hours Tuesday, frightening people but causing no casualties or damage, officials said. The quake measured 5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale and was centered about 60 miles northeast of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> resort of <LOCATION> Acapulco </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Guerrero </LOCATION> state, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Geophysical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said. It said the temblor could be felt in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, where a large quake measuring 6.8 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale caused panic a week ago. The April 25 quake killed one person and injured four people. In 1985, a quake in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> crumbled many buildings in the capital and killed at least 9,500 people. Seismologists in <LOCATION> Acapulco </LOCATION> said the temblor on Tuesday lasted seven seconds. The Central Fire Station in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> said the ground in the capital shook for 20 seconds. An earthquake measuring 5 on the scale can cause considerable damage in populated areas and one measuring 6 can cause severe damage. The Richter scale gauges the energy released by an earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. Every increase of one number of the scale indicates a tenfold increase in the magnitude.

 <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>'s fans gave her widower a block-long sympathy card Tuesday amid a worldwide outpouring of affection for the comedian who died last week. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Morton </PERSON>, widower of the redheaded clown from TV's `` I Love Lucy,'' accepted the missive contained on 127 poster-sized cards stretched along the Walk of Fame on <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION>. Miss Ball had two stars embedded in the walk, honoring her film and television careers. `` When you're married to someone for 29 years, you just do n't know _ you do n't take it for granted _ but you just do n't know the love that's out there,'' <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> said `` This is beyond all expectations. I ca n't believe how beautiful the world has been to her.'' Miss <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> died at age 77 Wednesday of a ruptured aorta while recovering from heart surgery. She was buried over the weekend after a private service at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in the <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>. The cards were presented by <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, a shoe store manager who put out blank cards over a five-day period. Ms. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, 35, said she found the first card at one of Miss Ball's starts Thursday morning. Fans were so eager to sign it that they were writing over each other's words, so she bought six cards which were completely filled in 15 minutes. She bought another six, and the same thing happened. `` I just kept going until I finished the sidewalk,'' Ms. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. The cards lay undisturbed until she picked them up Monday. `` People were still signing as I was taking it up. People were saying, ` Oh, I did n't get a chance to sign yet,''' Ms. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. Her favorite expression was written by street gang members: `` The homeboys of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION> love and miss <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON>.'' One woman left a lock of her red hair and signed, `` From a fellow redhead.'' The cards, folded into a manageable stack, were presented by Ms. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Hollywood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> officials <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Welsh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> on a sidewalk outside a <LOCATION> Sunset </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION> office building. They said the crowds that gathered by the sidewalk star all weekend were unusually large, even in this celebrity-worshipping city. `` We have never seen a demonstration of affection such as we have seen on this particular occasion,'' Welsh said. `` She was a part of people's lives so many years.''

<HEAD>Country Music Grows Dimmer In Northeast</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Country music's popularity seems to be ebbing in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, where it was never very strong to begin with, and you ca n't even find it on the FM dial anymore in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> WBOS </ORGANIZATION>, the only FM country music station in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, switched formats last week, joining several other stations in the Northeast that have hopped off the country-western hayride and onto an accelerating oldies bandwagon. However, the city still has two country stations on the AM band. The last boom in country music in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> was in 1981, after the release of `` Urban Cowboy,'' the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travolta-Debra </ORGANIZATION> Winger flick that sent sales of bolo ties and oval belt buckles soaring. `` The last year or couple of years, they've really been struggling to get big sales in country and western records,'' said <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, Calif.-based chain of 54 music stores. Nationally, country is still the most popular radio format, bolstered by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s well-publicized fondness for the <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> sound and by the continuing appeal of crossover artists like <PERSON> Emmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>. There are 2,421 country stations in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, compared with 2,325 adult contemporary stations, the next biggest category, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. But in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, contemporary dominates country, 249 to 69. Several stations that still provide western fare for <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION> said they can survive on their loyal base of listeners but will have to wait for the next boom to get rich. `` Everything in this business is cyclical and we know it will come back eventually,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, general manager of <ORGANIZATION> WDLW </ORGANIZATION>, one of two <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> AM stations sticking with the format. <ORGANIZATION> WBOS </ORGANIZATION>'s owner, <ORGANIZATION> Ackerley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION>, hired program director <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> from WJFK-FM in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to design the new `` album classics'' format for middle - and upper-class listeners over age 25 _ the group advertisers most want to reach <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> declined to comment on the station's finances, but said <PERSON> Ackerley </PERSON> had concluded that country music was `` not commercially viable in this market.'' Not everyone agrees. WORC-AM in <LOCATION> Worcester </LOCATION> had less than $ 250,000 in annual billings and was losing $ 20,000 a month until it switched from Top 40 to country 4 -LCB- years ago. Now it is approaching $ 1 million in billings and racking up solid profits, said programming director and announcer <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Gara </PERSON>. `` It's a hip sound,'' <PERSON> O'Gara </PERSON> said. `` If you're a 40-year-old man or woman and you're not into heavy metal, but you want something more snappy than what you hear on the elevator, then country music provides a good answer.''

 A joint Argentine-Iraqi-Egyptian project to produce medium-range ballistic missiles has fallen far behind schedule due to allied export controls, a top <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said Tuesday. Other officials said the missile, known as <ORGANIZATION> Condor </ORGANIZATION> 2, is several years away from being tested. `` We expected it to be tested two years ago, at least,'' said one official who spoke on condition of anonymity. The official said part of the technology required for the missile, which is being developed in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and bankrolled by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, was withheld by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Other parts were held back by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies. But `` we worry some technology did manage to get through,'' the official said. Israeli officials have accused West German firms of helping the <ORGANIZATION> Condor </ORGANIZATION> 2, which could eventually be used to carry nuclear or chemical warheads. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, assistant secretary of <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION>, told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> that the <ORGANIZATION> Condor </ORGANIZATION> 2 `` is far behind schedule and we believe this can be traced to problems in acquiring technology'' from signatories of the Missile Technology Control Regime -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> MTCR </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-. The <ORGANIZATION> MTCR </ORGANIZATION> was established to limit the spread of missiles in the Third World. It includes the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. `` Ballistic missiles _ relatively expensive and relatively difficult to acquire _ are spread throughout the Third World ...,'' testified <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinds </PERSON>, deputy assistant secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>, to the subcommittee on <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` Cruise missiles are generally cheaper and will become more available. As the hardware for large, unmanned aircraft and more accurate guidance systems becomes increasingly widespread, we will be faced with a new kind of threat.'' Ballistic missiles can be large and highly destructive. Cruise missiles are smaller and easier to hide. Sen. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>., said there is already enough tension in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> without the introduction of cruise missiles `` Just in this area, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, North and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION> all have ballistic weapons capability,'' he said. `` This is a frightening situation.'' <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is trying to get the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to cooperate in controlling the sale of missiles, but he made plain he does n't think such cooperation will solve the problem. `` <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and others have independent technological capability to construct large rockets,'' he said. <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> said <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> is planning to test a new missile called the Agni, which could carry a nuclear warhead 1,000 to 1,500 miles. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> exploded a single atomic device in 1974. <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> suggested that countries getting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid be told that such missiles cost billions which could be used for development.

 <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said Tuesday the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> charter, which calls for the destruction of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, is outdated and he favors a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace settlement based on the existence of both <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman was asked about the charter provision during a television interview on the first day of an official visit to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, and he replied: `` I was elected on a political program which is founded on the basis of two states,'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>. `` As for the charter, there is an expression in French, it is ` caduc.''' Caduc means outdated, or void. Initial reaction from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and from a major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Jewish organization was that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s statement was angled at public relations and changed nothing. President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> took the occasion of a 90-minute meeting with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> at the beginning of his two-day visit to express concern that the charter still contains a provision for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s destruction. <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Mauroy </PERSON>, leader of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, met with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> later and said he too brought up the charter. He said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief responded: `` This text has existed for many years and is now outdated. The leadership of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> was elected with a program that includes recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the abandonment of terrorism.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> frequently cites the charter provision as reason it will not deal with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which it considers a terrorist organization. Last December, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief publicly renounced terrorism and recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, smiling and in uniform, arrived in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> on Tuesday to an official greeting just below that for a chief of state: red carpets at the airport but no Palestinian flags; high-level talks but no greeting on the tarmac by the head or government or state. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s Jewish community largely disapproved of the visit. In the Jewish-dominated <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> garment district, shopkeepers and manufacturers set off their burglar alarms simultaneously for five minutes to show displeasure. Israeli activists protested outside the French consulate in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and the embassy in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>. Tuesday is <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s national day of mourning for the 6 million Jewish victims of the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Vedrine </PERSON>, spokesman for <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, read a statement implying the president urged <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> to drop the charter article about the destruction of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` During the meeting, Mr. <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> noted that the continuation in force of the charter of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, adopted in 1964, was contrary to important points of the political program adopted by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> on Nov. 15, 1988, and he believed things should be made clear,'' the statement said. Acting as the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> legislature, the council declared an independent Palestinian state at the <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> meeting and implicitly recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> by accepting pertinent <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolutions. In December, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> explicitly renounced terrorism and recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist. The statement read by the presidential spokesman said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was received in his position as head of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and in the context of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s adoption of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolutions `` concerning the recognition of the State of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and its rights and to the renunciation by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> of any form of terrorism.'' <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON>, spokesman for <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, commented in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, `` We do not have to take with seriousness every utterance from the mouth of <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. He has a rich record of making false declarations for public relations.'' <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Allon </PERSON> <PERSON> Liel </PERSON> said, `` As far as <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is concerned, there still has not been a specific decision by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to void the charter. It still exists.'' In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, chairman <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reich </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presidents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Major </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizations </ORGANIZATION> also remarked that only the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> can change the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> charter _ by a two-thirds vote at a special meeting _ and refused to do so in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reich </PERSON> called <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s statement `` meaningless'' and said it was clearly meant `` to give President <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> some comfort for embarrassing himself and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> by receiving with honor the world's ranking terrorist.

 Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has been burning up the campaign trail even though he remains an issue, not a candidate, in Sunday's presidential elections. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, whose command of the Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> gives him de facto control of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, is supporting a business associate, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Duque </PERSON>, against an opposition coalition headed by <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>. `` He can not stay impartial in this campaign,'' said Maj. <PERSON> Edgardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. `` Impartiality at this time would be irresponsibility on his part.'' But <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has made few joint appearances with his candidate. Instead, he has been working on his own image with regular visits to hamlets, labor unions and civic groups. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> laid the cornerstone of a housing project for the poor in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. A truck stopped by and served free beer to the estimated 200 people who showed up for the general's appearance <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has survived all attempts to oust him, from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions to a failed coup last year. He has retained his grip through government political parties and the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, whose members are the only visible authority in most rural towns. He has also tried to build an image as a Panamanian nationalist persecuted by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, and as a champion of the poor. In his visits to small towns, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> mingles with residents and listens to their complaints and requests for help with community projects. Many of those projects are then carried out by the local <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> unit. In his speeches, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has said the 500 municipal councilmen to be elected Sunday must be turned into a `` people's power'' assembly. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> went from a close friend and associate of intelligence agencies in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to a wanted man last year after he was indicted in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on drug-trafficking charges. He denies the charges, saying they stem from his refusal to cooperate with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government plans to train Nicaraguan rebels here for an invasion of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Former White House adviser Adm. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> `` came to try to convince the general in 1985,'' said Maj. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, a close associate of the general. `` When he left, he refused to shake <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s hand and told him ` be prepared to face the consequences.''' Shortly thereafter, <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> claimed, the campaign against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> began in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> demanded <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s ouster last year after he was indicted. But President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, who had been handpicked by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, was deposed when he tried to fire the general. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government imposed economic sanctions and the opposition has echoed demands that the general must leave. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> personally answered charges by opposition vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON>, the only time he got directly involved in the campaign. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> had called <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> a `` nail in the side'' that had to be removed. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said he would drive the nail deeper. It became a government slogan. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> also angered <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and the military recently when he said publicly that a opposition government could live with any military leader except <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. It was seen as an invitation to a coup. On April 21, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> joined Duque on a four-hour march at the head of the largest demonstration held by pro-government groups. But the rally was not overtly political _ it was organized by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> under the banner `` March of Friends of the Defense Forces.''

<HEAD>Lawmakers Call For Federal Ban On Fax-Transmitted Junk Mail</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Subs 5th graf to CORRECT ``Reduction'' to ``Regulation''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 Lawmakers fed up with `` junk mail'' clogging fax machines nationwide on Tuesday called for a federal ban on unsolicited ads transmitted to companies that say they do n't want the materials. `` Not only are unsolicited fax transmissions costly and annoying, but they are also an invasion of privacy,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Shays </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Conn </LOCATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> telecommunications subcommittee, introduced legislation Tuesday that would require direct marketing firms and other advertisers to maintain lists of targeted customers who specify they do not want to receive fax `` This bill would return a measure of control to fax machine owners,'' said <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, who noted that advertisements range from real estate offerings to facsimile supplies. The Facsimile Advertising Regulation Act also would require ad senders who buy new fax machines to use machines that identify the senders and provide the time of transmission and telephone numbers on each page. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has experienced an explosion of fax machines in recent years. An estimated 1 million were sold in 1987, 1.5 million last year and an anticipated 2.5 million machines this year, according to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Facsimile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. With that has come a proliferation of direct marketing groups using facsimile machines, tying up already overused fax machines and limiting companies' ability to transmit urgent documents. In addition, receiving companies have to pay for the paper used by unsolicited advertisements. `` Coupled with a computer or automatic dialer, an advertiser's fax machine can deliver tens of thousands of unsolicited messages a week to other fax machines across the country,'' <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> said Receiving companies have little recourse while manufacturers continue to search for a design that would deny access to senders who do not know a special password. But <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Gottlieb </PERSON>, director of state government affairs at the <ORGANIZATION> Direct </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents 3,000 direct marketing firms, denied that unsolicited fax advertisements are causing problems. She said the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has received only 20 complaints about unsolicited fax transmissions, compared to 8,000 complaints on telephone solicitations. `` We really think that it's premature for an issue to be legislated where there's no real problem,'' she said. <PERSON> Gottlieb </PERSON> also argued against a federal ban on legal grounds, saying it would violate 1st Amendment guarantees of freedom of speech. `` The question is, can speech in this form be regulated or restricted completely?'' she asked. `` We would say an outright ban would be unconstitutional.'' <PERSON> Gottlieb </PERSON> said the association considers the <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> bill an `` outright ban.'' More than a dozen state legislatures are weighing similar measures, including <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. All the measures were introduced for the first time this year, <PERSON> Gottlieb </PERSON> said. None has been enacted, although the <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> bill has been passed by the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> and awaits action by the governor, she added. <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>'s subcommittee is expected to have a hearing on the federal fax bill along with other telemarketing issues, congressional aides said.

 An unlicensed midwife on trial for murder in the deaths of three babies unexpectedly pleaded guilty Tuesday to involuntary manslaughter and insurance fraud in a plea bargain with the prosecution. <PERSON> Dolores </PERSON> <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON>, 36, had been accused along with Dr. <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Klvana </PERSON> of bungling high-risk out-of-hospital baby deliveries in which mothers should have been hospitalized. Mrs. <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON>, who has been in jail for more than two years while awaiting trial, was immediately sentenced to eight years in prison. The sentence was stayed, and she was to be released within 24 hours on five years probation, according to Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelberg </PERSON>. <PERSON> Klvana </PERSON>'s trial in the deaths of eight infants and a fetus between 1982 and 1986, will continue, <PERSON> Kelberg </PERSON> said. It is in recess because <LOCATION> Klvana </LOCATION>, 47, is ill and undergoing medical tests in jail. Mrs. <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> pleaded guilty to three counts of involuntary manslaughter, seven counts of insurance fraud, five counts of unlawfully practicing medicine without a license and one count of conspiracy to practice medicine without a license. Mrs. <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> had been charged in three of the eight baby deaths involving <PERSON> Klvana </PERSON>, who is charged with second-degree murder, insurance fraud and grand theft. In return for her guilty plea, prosecutors dropped three second-degree murder charges. <PERSON> Kelberg </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> had been offered the same deal earlier, but decided to accept it after becoming so emotionally distraught in court last week that she had to be taken to see a psychiatrist. The agreement was approved by <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirlin </PERSON>. As a condition of her probation, Mrs. <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> was ordered not to engage in the practice of medicine or associate with anyone practicing medicine. Mrs. <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> <PERSON> Keith </PERSON>, told jurors in his opening statement last month that the midwife believed in childbirth as `` a spiritual experience'' and was dedicated to tending women who shunned hospital births for religious or economic reasons. He said she insisted on strict prenatal care and protected the health of mothers and babies.

 <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Commandant <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> on Tuesday attacked <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s plan to clean up the Alaskan oil spill. Consumers, politicians and environmentalists expressed their anger in a one-day `` Boycott Exxon'' campaign. <PERSON> Yost </PERSON>, the top federal official tracking the environmental disaster, said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s plan was poorly drafted and lacking in specifics. But he stopped short of rejecting it, saying he wanted to meet with <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> and state officials. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, consumer activist <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> `` should not be allowed to forget'' the spill and that a boycott would send the oil giant a message. He and others blasted <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> for failing to be prepared for the spill and not rapidly responding to the accident that fouled hundreds of miles of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s coast. They also questioned subsequent increases in gas prices. `` We are beginning the war of words and actions against any oil company that does n't understand its responsibility to protect the environment,'' <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> state Sen. <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Amick </PERSON> told a boycott rally in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, about 400 chanting and sign-waving protesters rallied in front of <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s Alaskan headquarters to urge a consumer boycott. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Surette </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gasoline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retailers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Billerica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, said it was too early to assess the boycott's impact. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said 10,000 credit cards out of 7 million have been cut up and returned to the company since the spill. The oil company's cleanup strategy must gain <PERSON> Yost </PERSON>'s approval before being put into effect. <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> said he would make a decision on the proposal within a week. `` The plan is very thin,'' he told a news briefing. `` There's not a lot of backup or substantiation It was quite light, very thin. There must have been a lot of figures there that I have n't seen `` We are going to be done this summer,'' <PERSON> Yost </PERSON> said. `` Some beaches are going to be sparkling, some beaches are going to be far from sparkling.'' Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, who is to make his second trip to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> on Wednesday as overall coordinator for the cleanup, said he expected the size of the operation to double or triple by the end of the month. In a speech at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> called the spill `` the most significant environmental disaster this nation has ever faced.'' However, he said the cleanup, to be paid for by the oil industry, could add $ 100 million to $ 500 million to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s economy, which he said is more than the effect of the fishing industry <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> released a statement that called the boycott unjust. Exxon President <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said the company was `` turning heaven and <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> to set things right.'' <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s 60-page, two-part revised strategy to cleanse some 364 miles of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s coastline of the oil spilled March 24 by the tanker <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> was released Monday. The tanker struck a reef 25 miles from <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, spilling more than 10 million gallons of crude oil into Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. About 300 miles from the spill site, an observer saw thousands of dead birds in a wide tidal basin in the <LOCATION> Hallo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area. `` We saw 2,000 to 3,000 dead birds. ... You ca n't really tell what they are. They're one big blob of oil,'' said <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Bane </PERSON>, superintendent of <LOCATION> Katmai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, about 275 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>. `` We found large oil debris washing and slopping up on our shores. ... It was very bad,'' <PERSON> Bane </PERSON> said. `` We saw eagles carrying oil-covered birds. We saw one eagle so coated in oil that it could n't fly.'' State and federal officials said the focus of the cleanup is moving southwest, following the drifting oil along the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> through the <LOCATION> Shelikof </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> east of <LOCATION> Kodiak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. Oil has tainted the coast at least as far as <LOCATION> Chignik </LOCATION>, 525 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>. The tanker is undergoing preliminary repairs in the sound, and is to be moved next month to <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, home of the only drydock on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> capable of handling the 987-foot ship. In its proposal, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> said it wants to burn or bury the sludge recovered in the cleanup, which may require exemptions from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> environmental law. But <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamoreaux </PERSON>, the ranking state environmental officer at the spill, said the laws would not be relaxed. `` The general feeling is that we would expect that they would comply with the environmental laws,'' <PERSON> Lamoreaux </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s plan also notes that 191 miles of coastline it describes as `` lightly oiled'' may be left untouched to be cleansed naturally by wind and water. <PERSON> Lamoreaux </PERSON> said, `` When we talk about ` light oiling,' it does n't mean it wo n't have a devastating effect on wildlife. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sens. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Exon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON>, both <ORGANIZATION> Nebraska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, called on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> to investigate potential price gouging by the oil industry. They noted that gas prices in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> rose 20 percent from the first of March until mid-April. State attorneys general in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> echoed the call. Since the Exxon Valdez accident, gas prices have increased an average 10 percent nationally, while the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> saw surges as high as 25 percent in less than a month, said <PERSON> Marla </PERSON> <PERSON> Rae </PERSON>, executive assistant to <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Frohnmayer </PERSON>. At a news conference in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said it showed `` shocking naivete'' to blame the price hikes on his company. `` As you know,'' he told reporters, `` the market for petroleum products is set by thousands of markets, thousands of independent dealers across the nation.''

<HEAD>Court Clerks Strike For Pay Raises</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thousands of court clerks went on strike Tuesday in an effort to force the government to pay them the pay raise it promised them in March. The protest came one day after President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, whose government austerity program prompted violent protests in February, announced plans to increase benefits for the nation's workers and its poor Chanting `` We will not enter!'' court functionaries locked the criminal and civil courts in central <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> and congregated outside. `` Never mind a pay raise. We just want the raise that was already promised us,'' said <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Iturbe </PERSON>, a court clerk. <PERSON> Iturbe </PERSON> said the 30 percent pay raise for civil servants decreed by the government in March had not been included in their pay checks. Clerks now earn from $ 100 to $ 200 a month. The clerks said the daylong walkout was aimed at forcing the government to grant them the pay raise immediately. Increases for the public sector usually take several months to become effective. The clerks jeered as <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> troopers cut a chain that had shut the front doors. The soldiers retreated, and the doors were closed again. Perez announced the 30 percent pay raise for government workers shortly after the riots, which left at least 300 dead and thousands injured. The riots raised worldwide concerns about the Latin American economic crisis, the region's $ 410 billion foreign debt and falling world prices for its exports. Inflation in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> is estimated at 80 percent, and labor unrest is building. The nation's largest union, the Confederation of Venezuelan Workers, called for a one-day nationwide strike on May 18, the first in the nation's 30-year democratic history. Perez is under pressure by economic advisers to cut government spending and maintain the austerity measures designed to lead <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> towards a market-oriented economy. On Monday, however, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> announced the government would spent $ 540 million on a new series of public works projects, which he said would create 170,000 jobs in the next two years. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> also announced a program of direct subsidies for food intended for 600,000 poor families. The program would give target families $ 15 monthly per child, with a limit of up to three children. He did not outline how the subsidies would be distributed.

 Police who surrounded a jewelry store after employees reported a suspicious person casing the joint were stunned to learn the wigged man was pop superstar <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in disguise. In addition to the wig, the Grammy Award-winning singer was wearing a fake mustache, false teeth and eyelashes while shopping for rings at Sycamore Plaza here with a 12-year-old boy Monday afternoon. The two went into Zales Jewelers and aroused the suspicion of the store manager, said H.N. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, a security guard for the shopping center in this city 30 miles northest of downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>.

 Striking miners and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s largest coal company agreed to federal mediation after 140 people were arrested Tuesday and four were injured in a rock-throwing confrontations between miners and coal drivers. The incidents came on the 28th day of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> strike and were centered around <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>'s Moss No. 3 coal preparation plant in this southwest <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> community. Demonstators effectively blockaded the plant. `` They are n't running enough coal out of here to fire somebody's house,'' said strike coordinator <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> Gov. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON> announced that the union and the company had agreed to federal mediation of the dispute. <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> suggested a seven-day cooling off period in which <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> would shut down operations and the union would suspend protests. <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Odom </PERSON> said the company `` fully supported Governor <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON>' request for federal mediation.'' `` We are ready to begin mediation under the auspices of the federal <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conciliation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and we will make every effort in that process to resolve the dispute,'' <PERSON> Odom </PERSON> said. He also called on <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> to end the strike violence. `` It is the continued violence which is distasteful, dangerous and ultimately destructive of the mediation process,'' <PERSON> Odom </PERSON> said. The injuries came during a rock-throwing confrontation along a road leading to the plant where coal from nearby mines is cleaned, sorted and loaded into railroad cars. According to miner <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>, about 20 miners were standing in the rain watching coal trucks drive around a tree downed in the road when the driver of a four-wheel-drive escort vehicle rammed into the crowd. `` He done his best to run over all he could,'' said <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>. `` He punched it.'' But <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> said troopers told him the injured strikers were in a parked vehicle that was hit by the coal truck as the driver attempted to flee `` a hailstorm of rocks thrown by miners.'' Two miners were taken to the <ORGANIZATION> Russell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in nearby <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, said nursing supervisor <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>. One was treated and released and the other was admitted for treatment of bruises. <PERSON> Odom </PERSON> said a passenger in the escort vehicle suffered a broken jaw while the driver of one of the trucks, owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Jamb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, suffered serious cuts to the head. Both were being treated at local hospitals. The 140 people arrested, some of them miners' wives, sat in front of the Moss No. 3 plant's entrances to block coal trucks that were coming and going They were charged with trespassing, said Lt. C.F. <PERSON> Eaton </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>. After four busloads of arrested demonstrators were driven away, others hit the road in their own cars to make the 15-mile drive between Moss No. 3 and <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON> <PERSON> Fork </PERSON> mine in an attempt to slow coal trucks traveling between the two operations, <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> estimated about 24 trucks carried coal into the plant, which did not appear to be operating. About 570 trucks usually make the trip each day, he said. About 1,500 miners in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> are on strike. Miners worked at <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> for 14 months without a contract before calling the strike April 5. Strike leaders say <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's 15th largest coal company and second biggest coal exporter, has refused to take part in contract negotiations and violated labor laws. Both sides agree that wages are not a major part of the dispute.

 Hailstorms that battered wide areas of southwest <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> province killed 157 people and injured 6,000, the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Daily said Wednesday. The storms, which hit 105 of the province's 175 counties from April 20 through last week, also destroyed 170,000 houses, the English-language newspaper said. Earlier reports had put the death toll from the storms at 87. The newspaper said the provincial government is mobilizing all departments for rescue and relief operations for the disaster-affected areas. Western <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> was also hit by two powerful earthquakes last month that killed at least 11 people. The hailstorms were attributed to collisions of warm and cold fronts. Hail and windstorms also killed seven people in <LOCATION> Guizhou </LOCATION> province to the east of <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> in late April.

 Authorities questioned the son of a minister found shot to death with his wife and two daughters in their rural parsonage, but declined to say Tuesday whether the teen-ager was a suspect. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelley </PERSON>, 17, was questioned Monday night, said <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joseph </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's Sgt. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Feirrell </PERSON>. He declined to say whether <PERSON> Pelley </PERSON> had requested legal counsel. No arrests have been made in the shooting deaths of the youth's father, the Rev <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelley </PERSON>, 38; his wife, <PERSON> Dawn </PERSON>, 32; and daughters <PERSON> Janel </PERSON>, 8, and <PERSON> Jolene </PERSON>, 6. The victims' bodies were found Sunday morning in the parsonage of the <ORGANIZATION> Olive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Branch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brethren </ORGANIZATION> in Christ, about two miles northwest of <LOCATION> Lakeville </LOCATION>, after the minister failed to show up for the service. Autopsy results indicated the minister and his wife died Saturday of close-range shotgun wounds to the head, said <PERSON> Feirrell </PERSON>. Autopsies on the children were incomplete. No further information on the autopsies was provided. `` This is information known to the suspect and the police, and at this point we'd like to keep it that way,'' said <PERSON> Feirrell </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelley </PERSON> returned to his home Tuesday and left with some personal belongings, police said. He was accompanied by his grandfather, who police identified as <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, Ky. The younger <PERSON> Pelley </PERSON> told authorities he had spent Saturday at high school prom activities, police said. Police found him Sunday at an amusement park north of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, where he had driven with friends. Police divers searched a pond across the road from the parsonage Tuesday, looking for the weapon and other evidence, said <PERSON> Feirrell </PERSON>. No weapon was found. Investigators ruled out burglary and robbery as motives because the home showed no sign of forced entry. The absence of a weapon ruled out murder-suicide. The parents had been married almost four years; their first spouses both died, congregation members said. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON>, 14, were <PERSON> Pelley </PERSON>'s children from his first marriage, and <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON>, 10, <PERSON> Janel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jolene </PERSON> were Ms. <PERSON> Pelley </PERSON>'s daughters. <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> was attending a church camp when the killings occurred, and <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> was spending the night with friends, police said. A pastor colleague said the Pelleys had experienced some turmoil in merging the two families, but declined to explain. A memorial service for the Pelleys was scheduled for Wednesday afternoon at their church, with burial in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bend </LOCATION>, which is about 10 miles north of <LOCATION> Lakeville </LOCATION>.

 Six riot troopers were killed in fighting with radical students on Wednesday when police raided a university in the southern port of <LOCATION> Pusan </LOCATION> to rescue five officers being held hostage, officials said. The officials said students set fire to a barricade doused with paint thinner when the raiding force burst in, setting several police ablaze. Police, who refused to give their names, said about 700 troopers launched a dawn raid on <ORGANIZATION> Dongui </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> to rescue five officers taken hostage Tuesday after a demonstration by students. About 20 other troopers and radical students were injured in the fighting, 10 of them seriously. Students holding the hostages on the seventh floor of the school library set the thinner-drenched barricade aflame when troopers burst in and several attacking officers were set on fire, the officials said on condition of anonymity. Some troopers, wrapped in flames, leapt out of windows. Others choked to death on the smoke or were badly burned, they reported. Three troopers were dead on arrival at a hospital and three died while undergoing emergency treatment, they said. All of the hostages were later freed when professors intervened and persuaded the students to let them go, officials said. Korean Broadcasting System, the state television network, said 88 students were arrested in the fighting in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s second largest city. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Headquarters </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> said it was the worst loss of police life in recent years. Officers could not recall any comparable incident. The students had seized five officers as hostages to protest an incident Monday when a police officer fired warning shots as protesters attacked a police station. Radical students claimed police overreacted by firing. They also demanded release of a fellow student being held by police, officials said. Police officials negotiated unsuccessfully through the night for the hostages' release and authorities then ordered a raid to free them. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has been hit by a wave of violent protests in recent weeks by radical students and dissidents demanding the overthrow of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>'s government. <LOCATION> Pusan </LOCATION> and other <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> cities experienced violence Monday in protests marking the international May Day labor holiday. The protests came the day after riot police blocked a major labor rally in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Protests rarely result in deaths in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, however, in spite of the fury of street clashes in which protesters battle riot police with firebombs and rocks. Riot police are normally only armed with tear gas and batons.

<TEXT>
 Army experts cleared military rockets off an interstate highway Tuesday after the truck carrying them overturned when its driver swerved to avoid hitting a deer. A seven-mile section of Interstate 20 running through this central <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> town was closed for more than 14 hours after the truck, carrying eight rocket pods loaded with six rockets each, ran off the road, authorities said. Explosives experts from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hood </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, worked for more than three hours to remove the rockets, each of which carried 644 M-77 grenades, said officials with the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION>. The rockets were not armed and posed no danger, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION> `` Part of the development program involved taking fully loaded rockets and dropping them 20 to 30 feet onto concrete to see if they could withstand that kind of impact,'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said. Officials evacuated one resident of a mobile home located about 200 yards from the accident site, but allowed her to return seven hours later, police Sgt. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Willingham </PERSON> said. The driver and a passenger suffered minor injuries, police said. `` All I know is I saw a deer and I swerved to miss it,'' said the driver, <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, 27, of <PERSON> Fouke </PERSON>, Ark. `` There was no indication of any problem physically with either the driver or the truck,'' said state Trooper <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Rannefeld </PERSON>. The rockets were being transported from the <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> factory in <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, where they were produced to <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and ultimately were bound for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, said Col. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>, a combat support group commander from <ORGANIZATION> Dyess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s drug policy chief pledged Tuesday not to pinch pennies but said after congressmen pressed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for action on various fronts that choices must be made about priorities in the war against drugs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Narcotics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> had what was termed a spirited meeting at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, with the lawmakers presenting assorted concerns about drug education, interdiction, regional approaches and treatment. After the session, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION>, said that `` we're not going to be pinch-penny in this war on drugs. We're going to have a fiscally responsible policy, but choices are going to have to be made.'' Considerable discussion focused on <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s decision to make the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> an area for intensive anti-drug activity before completing an overall national strategy, the participants said. Committee members also said they appreciated gaining access to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` It was a positive and preliminary meeting,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, D-Calif. `` The very fact that the meeting was held is significant, and a good step for the administration ... President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is willing to work with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in a way that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was not. He got high marks for having the meeting.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> promised to seek additional congressional views and agreed to meet with the committee next week to further discuss drug policy. `` Most people believe that the effort has to be made on many fronts. But some choices will have to be made, too, ... about priorities,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. Choices involve `` what gets more, what gets the same, where do we throw our weight,'' he added. He said all members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have been asked for recommendations. He added that officials will not know how much the anti-drug program will cost until various agencies provide projections involving the various aspects. No policy decisions were made at the meeting. Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee chairman, said he had wanted assurances from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s drug policy coordinating energy `` is not consumed'' by the push <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> announced for the capital city. `` It was pointed out that when we were drafting the bill'' that created the drug coordinator position, `` we hd considered him to lend his expertise to developing a domestic and foreign policy and not one for the district,'' <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON> avoided direct criticism of <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, and said he was satisfied that the administration has promised to have an international conference on drugs after the drug policy review is finished in early September. <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON> previously voiced objections that the administration was not taking enough of a global approach. He said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> should include drug policy in the government's foreign policy considerations with drug-producing countries. The meeting ended with a pledge of cooperation on anti-drug policy between the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the participants said. <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON> predicted there will be no sharp conflict as long as the administration keeps <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> advised rather than waiting until a policy is complete and then going to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to consult. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said the government's effort in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is not a substitute for a national strategy, which is being developed by the government now, but is part of the overall strategy. He said he personally is spending little time on the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> effort, leaving that to various government departments.

<HEAD>Students Keep Convicted Murderer as Honorary President</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Students at the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> failed to muster the two-thirds majority they needed Tuesday to oust the convicted murderer of a policeman as honorary president of their union. School and government officials responded with anger to the vote, which allows <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Silcott </PERSON> to keep the honor given to him by the students on Thursday. The college's governors said they were reviewing the school's annual $ 439,000 grant to the union. Education Secretary <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, speaking to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>, called the vote `` shameful and despicable.'' `` This is the loony left hijacking a great institution,'' he added. The students voted 530-305 in favor of removing the jailed man from the post. However, that tally narrowly failed to meet the two-thirds majority that would have overturned his election. In a separate vote, the students agreed to raise money to buy flowers for the family of the murder victim. <PERSON> Silcott </PERSON>, 29, is one of three men jailed for life for hacking a policeman to death during a riot in a north <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> housing project in 1985. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, the human rights organization, and <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Gifford </PERSON>, a leading jurist, have investigated the case and cast doubt on the convictions. <PERSON> Silcott </PERSON> was nominated for the one-year post by a member of the school's socialist <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. Just 150 of the school's 4,000 students voted him in to show their belief he may have been wrongly convicted. After the initial vote, the college's <ORGANIZATION> Afro-Caribbean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> said the election of <PERSON> Silcott </PERSON>, who is black, was `` deplorable, insensitive and patronizing to the black race.'' On Tuesday, heated exchanges broke out among students after their new vote. <PERSON> Amanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, the general secretary of the student union, said she had received several death threats after last week's vote. `` Obviously I am scared, but I will stand by the union's decision,'' she said Sir <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, chairman of the school's governors, termed the students' decision to keep <PERSON> Silcott </PERSON> as their honorary president `` appalling.'' He said the school could not overturn the decision under the union's constitution. But he added, `` It is very embarrassing and damaging to the school. `` Whatever happens in the union, nothing must happen there that will damage the worldwide reputation of this school,'' he said. The school's director, <PERSON> Indraprasad </PERSON> <PERSON> Patel </PERSON>, said he was seeking ways for the college to reverse the decision. `` They have got to use every device in the rule book to overturn this disgraceful decision,'' said Sir <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, a lawmaker from the governing <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 The leftist Sandinista government on Tuesday rejected an opposition demand to negotiate for more legislative reforms to guarantee fair elections next year. But both government and opposition representatives agreed to meet again and present their cases to a panel charged with evaluating whether the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have fulfilled promises made in regional pacts. `` To accept -LRB- negotiations -RRB- is to accept that the government has not fulfilled its part of the <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> accords,'' <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunez </PERSON>, minister of the presidency, said after a two-hour meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reconciliation </ORGANIZATION>. `` The step previous to acknowledging this request is for an evaluation to be made on whether the <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> accords have been met,'' he added. Cardinal <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y Bravo, the archbishop of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> and president of the committee, said the panel would meet again May 10 to hear both sides and would then issue its evaluation. <PERSON> Nunez </PERSON> attended the meeting representing Vice President <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, a committee member representing the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mauricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and panel's opposition representative, presented the demand in a letter addressed to <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> that he read to reporters. President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> and the presidents of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> signed an agreement in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> Feb. 14 in which <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> promised electoral and other legal reforms to ensure fair general elections, which <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> moved up by 10 months to Feb. 25, 1990. The Sandinista-controlled <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> passed the reforms to electoral and news media laws in March. But the opposition said their demands were ignored and that the laws passed give the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> unfair advantage in balloting. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> is now on a 10-country tour of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to seek financial and political support for <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Some of those governments have said more money to this Central American country depends on the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>' fulfillment of regional peace accords. At a news conference Tuesday in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said he was trying to find a way to improve relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and declared, `` We are not its enemy.'' He expressed hope that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would change the policies toward <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> pursued by President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` must know that policy failed and that is why he should do something different,'' he said. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> is suffering a severe economic crisis and badly needs foreign aid. The government blames the crisis on eight years of war with the U.S.-supported Nicaraguan rebels known as Contras, a four-year <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic blockade, and devastation wrought by Hurricane <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> in October. The opposition says the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>' managerial ineptness has had much to do with the country's economic problems.

 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal for resolving the internal <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> dispute over short-range nuclear missiles does not address West German demands for <LOCATION> East-West </LOCATION> negotiations on the weapons, an alliance official said Tuesday. In <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> said he was open to `` reasonable compromise'' but wants talks to begin soon. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> have rejected such negotiations. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, however, expressed hope the allies could reach a unified position on the issue during a summit at the end of this month. He said <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> could negotiate on the battlefield weapons at the same time it discusses strategic arms, conventional forces and chemical weapons. The comments came after a meeting with Premier <PERSON> Ciriaco </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON>, who said <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> supports linking the proposed talks on reducing the short-range nuclear weapons to progress in conventional arms talks. In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, Foreign Ministers <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> told reporters it is essential that a common position emerge from the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit. Most of the short-range Lance missiles are in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and a battle fought with such weapons would take place on its territory. The <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> official said the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> plan suggests the 16-member <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> announce unilateral reductions in its short-range nuclear arsenal and challenge the Soviet-led <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> to meet those levels. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, A <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> policy paper said the Soviets have modernized or replaced 95 percent of their short-range nuclear missile systems in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in the past five years. A separate `` fact sheet'' said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> `` has been aggressively pursuing'' modernization of its short-range forces and now has a 16-1 advantage over <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> west of the <LOCATION> Ural </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>. As described by the alliance official, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan calls for reducing the number of weapons as part of a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> program of modernizing the Lance missiles. Additional reductions in those arms would be linked to progress in East-West negotiations in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> on conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the official said. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> confirmed the account but said several other options were under consideration. He said one was resumption of research and development by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> on a missile that could attack airfields and other targets now covered by the <PERSON> Lance </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, a German official said: `` The German position remains clear and unchanged. No decision on modernization until 1992 and prompt superpower talks on the short-range missiles.'' He dismissed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> suggestions as `` old stuff that people are using to divert the discussion from the real issues.'' None of the three officials would let his name be used. Alliance members are seeking acceptable language on the weapons issue to write into the Comprehensive Concept, a blueprint for <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> strategy to be presented to the May 29-30 summit at NATO headquarters in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> official said the American plan pulls together several ideas that have been put forward in the alliance. It would take reductions proposed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> supreme military commander in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and challenge the Soviets to meet them. <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> has urged <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> to upgrade the <PERSON> Lance </PERSON>, arguing that its modernization would permit a substantial reduction in nuclear artillery. Military analysts say the missile, introduced in 1972, will become obsolete in 1995. It has a range of a little more than 60 miles, which would be extended by modernization to more than 250 miles.

 Cardinal <PERSON> Giuseppe </PERSON> <PERSON> Siri </PERSON>, the archbishop of <ORGANIZATION> Genoa </ORGANIZATION> and a perennial candidate for the papacy, died at home Tuesday evening of a heart ailment, an official at the diocesan chancellery said. He was 82. <PERSON> Siri </PERSON>, a cardinal since 1953, attended four conclaves, the meetings in which popes are elected. He was described as Pope <PERSON> Pius </PERSON> <PERSON> XII </PERSON>'s choice to succeed him, and in the last two conclaves was a leading vote-getter in early balloting. He was frequently depicted as an archconservative who opposed many of the reforms of Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> XXIII </PERSON> and who tried to block progressive initiatives during the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> II Council held from 1962-65. But <PERSON> Siri </PERSON> rejected the conservative label in a rare interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Genoa </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Il </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lavoro </ORGANIZATION>. `` If I had to describe myself, I would describe myself as an independent, a man who walks alone and is not a member of any group,'' he said. A staunch anti-Communist, he nonetheless maintained working relations with the Socialist-Communist alliance running <ORGANIZATION> Genoa </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Siri </PERSON> believed that laymen must obey the clergy, and that the clergy had to make all possible efforts to be available anywhere, at any time, to laymen. In <LOCATION> Genoa </LOCATION>, he made sure chaplains were on duty in major factories, and he encouraged priests to celebrate Mass in parishioners' homes. <PERSON> Siri </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Genoa </LOCATION> on May 20, 1906, the son of a stevedore. He attended the <ORGANIZATION> Pontifical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gregorian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, where he earned a doctorate in theology. Ordained a priest at 22, his early career was mainly in the framework of <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION>, a church organization that seeks to involve laymen in church activities. He wrote several books, the best known being `` Theology for Laymen.'' <PERSON> Siri </PERSON> was particularly remembered for his resourcefulness during World War II, when, as auxiliary bishop of <ORGANIZATION> Genoa </ORGANIZATION>, he negotiated with <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> forces surrounding the city and met secretly with partisan leaders, eventually arranging a <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> surrender that avoided further bombardment of the city. He became archbishop of <ORGANIZATION> Genoa </ORGANIZATION> in 1946. At the time of his resignation in July 1987, he was the last remaining active cardinal named by Pope <PERSON> Pius </PERSON> <PERSON> XII </PERSON>.

 Police searched Tuesday for a 6-week-old girl whose parents said was abducted under circumstances almost identical to the disappearance of their other daughter three years ago, officials said. About 20 local, state and federal law enforcement officers aided by tracking dogs have been looking for <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> since Sunday, police Sgt. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> told a news conference. Parents <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>, 37, and <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>, 30, said the baby was abducted Saturday night in almost exactly the same way their 13-day-old daughter, <PERSON> Loralei </PERSON>, was taken three years ago. <PERSON> Loralei </PERSON>'s body was found later Mrs. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> said a gunman approached her outside their home around 10:30 p.m. Saturday while her husband was at work at a steel plant. She told police she was forced back into the house and knocked out. An hour later, she told authorities, her husband returned home, revived her and discovered the baby missing. In June 1986, Mrs. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> told police a masked gunman broke into their home around 10:20 p.m. while her husband was at work and took <PERSON> Loralei </PERSON>. The baby's body was found five days later, about 150 feet from the couple's home in <LOCATION> Brighton </LOCATION>, which is about 10 miles north of this town of 40,000 people across the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. No cause of death was determined and no arrests were made in that case, although authorities said the parents were suspects. The two failed a lie detector test of their account of <PERSON> Loralei </PERSON>'s disappearance, said <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Yocom </PERSON> They claimed Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination and did n't testify before a county grand jury that investigated the death, he said Investigators said Tuesday they had no evidence to doubt the couple's claim in <PERSON> Heather </PERSON>'s disappearance. `` There's nothing to indicate that the <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> are anything but victims at this time,'' <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> said. Investigators have found little evidence and have few leads, he said. `` We have n't given up hope of finding the baby alive,'' the sergeant added. A hospital found no evidence Mrs. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> was injured Saturday night, he said. The couple's 15-month-old son, who was sleeping at home at the time, was not disturbed, officials said. No valuables were taken and no ransom note was left.

 The AIDS crisis is giving a boost to sex education but is also crowding other critical sexual topics out of the curriculum, concluded a nationwide survey released today. Forty states either support or require sex education, said the study conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> Alan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guttmacher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. But it concluded that the current `` crisis orientation'' spawned by concern over AIDS has led educators to stress `` the negative outcomes of sex'' while often neglecting other important issues such as pregnancy prevention. Thus while birth control is dealt with by most school districts, it is usually from the standpoint of disease rather than pregnancy prevention, according to the report. `` Support for sex education is strong. Not only does a large majority of the American public support it, but so do most state education agencies and large school districts,'' said the study, `` Risk and Responsibility: <ORGANIZATION> Teaching </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Schools Today.

 Life in the fast lane is screeching to a halt as too many cars jam too little concrete in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s motor mecca. Angelenos still love their cars, but using them is pushing many to the braking point. Traffic planning took a wrong turn somewhere along the road. Drivers spend more time reading bumper stickers than getting where they want to go. Even a flat tire or passing shower can turn a commute into an hours-long ordeal. And the one-time showcase of top-down freeway living now faces the nation's worst traffic conditions and related ozone pollution. `` It is as bad as it seems,'' said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` Congestion is growing at 15 percent a year.'' With Southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s population expanding 3 percent a year and vehicle mileage jumping 4 percent, gridlock is changing the way people live. `` The freeways have been operating reasonably well in a lot of areas, but close to full,'' <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> said. `` Now, additional travel is taking it over ` full' and the break point has occurred.'' Although segments of <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> and two regional light rail transit projects are under construction, the city's status as the largest metropolitan region in the country without a mass transit system is assured for years. The three systems will have 46 miles of track by 1993. The most optimistic estimates put daily ridership at 213,000 passengers by the year 2000. In <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> today, there are 25 million daily trips, 97 percent in cars and the rest in buses. That's in a county with 8.6 million residents, 6.5 million registered vehicles and 504 miles of freeway. `` I do n't know what's going to help <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION> congestion at this point, but it ca n't hurt,'' said <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Marion </PERSON>, an executive in a law firm who faces a 40-mile one-way commute and a $ 130-a-month parking bill. `` If it came to my neighborhood, I'd take it,'' she said of the planned subway. Some experts argue that the billions going to the high-tech subway would be better spent on buses, carpools and other traffic improvements. But even with rail transit in place, transportation planners face limited options and dwindling funds as they try to negotiate ideas through the region's hodgepodge of federal, state, regional and municipal agencies. `` There is n't enough money, there is n't enough land and the environmental constraints and financial constraints are such that it's no longer possible to exclusively build our way out of the problem,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Remen </PERSON>, chief deputy director for the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The commission has selected $ 7 billion in transportation improvement projects statewide for the next five years, but <PERSON> Remen </PERSON> said the primary funding source, the state gasoline tax, is being eroded by inflation. Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>, an anti-tax crusader, tried to solve the problem in June with a $ 1 billion bond measure for highway improvements; voters rejected the idea. <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>'s fallback plan was a series of `` transportation summits'' with business, labor, government, transit advocates and others. On April 4, he called for a special election in November to let voters decide on a detailed 10-year, $ 20 billion transportation improvement plan that includes a 9-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax hike. The governor, however, refused to firmly pledge his support for the plan, and political analysts show little enthusiasm for a costly special election, when voter turnout is usually low but anti-tax sentiment usually high. Funding problems aside, transportation planners agree that costly capital projects, such as double-decking freeways, are financially prohibitive and politically impractical, if not impossible. As a result, transportation officials are concentrating on wringing more efficiency out of an overloaded system. `` What we've had to do in the city is focus our efforts on traffic management options and also on demand,'' said <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON>, general manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Remen </PERSON> said state officials are considering not just projects to expand capacity, but techniques to improve freeway efficiency and land-use management to encourage commuters to live closer to their jobs. `` It's going to require everything,'' he said. `` It's going to require all means available.'' Hanging over the entire process is a threatened crackdown of the federal Clean Air Act, which orders the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and regional state agencies to meet federal air quality standards. Drastic measures already have been enacted by the regional <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quality </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>, which has power to enforce air quality standards, and more stringent steps are being taken. `` Under state legislation, we're authorized to mandate companies to offer ride-sharing programs, and we've done that,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Eichhorn </PERSON>, a district spokesman. `` We can regulate truck traffic during peak hours and we can require owners of fleet vehicles ... to start buying vehicles that burn clean fuels.'' Another regional agency, the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governments </ORGANIZATION>, has been working to improve air quality by studying land use regulations and by developing a regional mobility plan. But the task is daunting, as reflected by the executive summary of a draft of the Air Quality Management Plan released by <ORGANIZATION> SCAG </ORGANIZATION> in September. The 20-year plan is estimated to cost $ 42 billion; a heart-stopping aspect is that its goal is to restore the degree of mobility motorists had in 1984. Meanwhile, drivers are coping with worsening traffic in a variety of ways. On any given morning, motorists can be seen using cellular phones, applying makeup, shaving, eating breakfast, talking back to language tapes and flirting. In fact, there are several dating services specializing in roadway romance, including Drive Me Wild of <LOCATION> Simi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, which uses bumper stickers to facilitate matchmaking.

<HEAD>Capital of Urban Sprawl Turns Slowly to Mass Transit</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Another Look: LA Jam</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 This symbol of urban sprawl and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s car addiction, is at long last inking a few mass transit lines on its tangled road map. They're ripping up the downtown streets to put in the first 4.4 miles of a subway, and trolly-like light rail lines are being built between downtown and <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, and across a patchwork of south side neighborhoods. That's a dramatic departure from tradition for a city that stands alone among major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> metropolises in having no rail transit whatsoever. Here's a look at the projects under construction: _ <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION>: A 4.4-mile, $ 1.2 billion, subway scheduled to open in 1993 will start at Union Station in the northeast, pass under the civic center and financial district and terminate near <LOCATION> MacArthur </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> A 13-mile extension into the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> suburbs is tentatively scheduled to be done in 1998. It will be financed 55 percent from the federal government, 17 percent from the state, 14 percent from a sales tax surcharge, 11 percent from merchant assessments and 3 percent from the city. _ Long Beach-Los Angeles light rail: A $ 752 million, 21.5-mile trolly style line mostly on existing tracks and powered by overhead wires is meant for both commuters and as a local train for those in largely low-income neighborhoods It will be funded through sales tax. _ Norwalk-El Segundo light rail: A $ 400 million, 19.5-mile east-west trolly will follow the Century Freeway, which is being built at the same time At the west end is <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> and aircraft factories. Funding comes from the sales tax.

<HEAD>Atlantic Ocean is Star of New PBS Series</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 To most of us, it's an innocuous strip of blue that separates the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> on the world map, or that tedious nothingness that takes hours to go by outside the window of an airplane. But the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, a shifting, churning, life-giving, living character, is the star of an ambitious new, three-part series, `` Atlantic Realm,'' beginning tonight on PBS. The first episode, `` Island Arks,'' examines the origins of the ocean, from its beginnings some 165 million years ago as little more than a river separating two continents before they began to drift apart. The series offers scientific and historical data on the evolution of the ocean, but is thankfully taken up more with superb photography of wildlife the ocean has spawned than by maps and charts. One of the highlights of the first episode is the birth of a litter of lemon sharks in the shallows near the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, an event never before photographed in the wild. Life above the sea is featured in the first episode, especially the myriad sea birds that live on islands off the coast of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> where the delicate ebb and flow of the ecology is easily observed _ such as the environmental upheaval caused when mariners introduced domesticated cats to one small island. The series is engrossing and lovely to watch, despite occasionally overwrought narrative, such this sample from a segment on <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>: `` Solidified lava is one of the raw materials of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. Forged in fire, it's stern but ready to accept the life that pioneers its surface. Below, the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> marine organisms would exploit this new territory, but here, laid bare to the winds of the air, lichens, mosses and herbs have taken hold along this broad and rolling swath of the salt that is part of the <LOCATION> mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> ridge.'' Phew. Narrator <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> manages to read such passages with aplomb if not a breath. The series, a joint production of <ORGANIZATION> WTTW </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION>, was created by <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Redfern </PERSON>, who wrote the book `` The Making of a Continent'' on which a previous, six-part <ORGANIZATION> PBS </ORGANIZATION> television series was based. `` I was looking for something to follow ` The Making of a Continent,''' said <PERSON> Redfern </PERSON> in a statement about `` <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> Realm,'' `` and the obvious thing was the making of an ocean.'' <PERSON> Redfern </PERSON>'s book on the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> is due out soon Next week's episode, `` Ocean of Light,'' focuses on the effects of the winds that brush the top of ocean and the life forms that live near the surface, including whales. The cameras go the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> for first-time pictures of the underwater ballet of Weddell seals. Later, they capture the flow of translucent animals that drift along the surface of the open ocean. `` Into the Abyss'' is the series' big finish, with cameras diving a half-mile below the ocean's surface to examine the strange creatures that dwell in the lightless depths. The cameras also take viewers to the longest submerged mountain range on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and take a peek inside an underwater volcano.

<HEAD>The Ideologies of Conflict</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Economic ideologies, with their code words and slogans, may persist in the abstract long after they have been questioned and sometimes even abandoned in practice. It happens in every system, but nowhere more dramatically at the moment than in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, where the centrally planned economies of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> have been flirting with private enterprise. In the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, a fifth of the nation's 50,000 farms have begun leasing land and equipment to individuals and families. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> has authorized 23,000 private co-ops. In <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> stock market has been reopened. Less abrupt changes are under way in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>. And in the Soviet republics of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, where national identity has remained vitally alive, there has been pressure for the legalization of private property. Privatization is a worldwide trend, says the <ORGANIZATION> Reason </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, which exists to promote private enterprise. In 1988, it says, governments shifted $ 43 billion of functions and responsibilities to the private sector. When that happens in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which sold <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> for $ 1.6 billion in 1987, or in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, where the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Authority </LOCATION> was privatized, it is n't startling news, because such things have been proposed for years. <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, where governments scorned private enterprise since World War II, is another matter. Seeking to raise production through individual initiative, some startling changes have occurred. These are excerpts from Reason's 1988 report. _ <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> In a reversal after 50 years of collectivized agriculture, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> began allowing individual farmers and groups of farmers to rent land from the state in a move that essentially marks a return to family farming. Legislation was enacted allowing farmers to buy tractors, trucks and other so-called means of production that formerly could be acquired only through state enterprises. Farmers were permitted to hire workers as long as they met wage levels in state enterprises. The government also authorized the sale of state-owned homes to tenants. Apartments can be sold on receipt of 50 percent of the unit's value, with the remainder to be paid over 10 years. _ <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> Commencing in 1988, some 23,000 private cooperatives were given permission to operate, though only half had become operative by the end of the year. They include restaurants, butcher shops, shoe repair shops and plumbing services. In another broadening of reforms, Polish enterprises can employ up to 50 workers per shift. Formerly, private enterprises had been limited to only 10 workers per shift. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> also is removing import duties on some Western goods and will allow foreign investors to own 100 percent of some Polish enterprises. There's a downside: A graduated income tax takes 90 percent on upper incomes. _ <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> In addition to the opening of the <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> stock market in 1988, private stock ownership is now possible. Previously, only state banks and cooperatives could purchase shares in the 40 state-owned companies that have issued stock. Private individuals also may form limited companies. These companies can employ as many as 500 workers. Just last year, more than 100 joint ventures were set up with foreigners. Such changes in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> might be phases or experiments, but the motivation for them contains an ideological message. Underlying all of them is the belief that if unleashed, individual initiative produces wondrous things.

<TEXT>
 Suppose they gave the Tony Awards and nobody won? After the worst season for Broadway musicals in years, the 1989 <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> nominations will be announced Monday and the possible contenders for top musical honors include only six shows. They are `` <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>' Broadway,'' `` Black and Blue,'' `` Chu Chem'' and `` Starmites,'' as well as such already-closed flops as `` Legs Diamond,'' `` Carrie'' and `` Welcome to the Club.'' `` <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>' Broadway'' would seem to be a shoo-in for a best musical nomination as well as the leading contending for the top prize, which carries a lot of clout at the box office. The Robbins musical, a collection of numbers from such shows as `` West Side Story,'' `` Gypsy,'' `` Fiddler on the Roof'' and other hits, may not need the boost as much as the other musicals still running. It's already doing near capacity business and has a healthy advance. `` Chu Chem,'' billed as the first Chinese-Jewish musical, has been limping along at the box office, despite an extensive television ad campaign by its producer and composer <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON>. `` Black and Blue,'' a celebration of blues singing and tap dancing, has done better business, although it has not approached the sell-out status of the Robbins show. `` Starmites'' is another iffy proposition. The space-age, comic-strip musical was panned by most major critics, except for a favorable review in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. The picture is brighter for the best play category which has several respectable candidates for nominations. The heavy favorite is <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wasserstein </PERSON>'s `` The <ORGANIZATION> Heidi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicles </ORGANIZATION>,'' which already has captured the Pulitzer Prize as well as the Outer Critics Circle Award. Other likely candidates include `` <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Valentine </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Willy </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>'s one-woman play starring <PERSON> Pauline </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>; `` Lend Me a Tenor,'' a farce by <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Ludwig </PERSON>; `` Ghetto,'' by <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> <PERSON> Sobel </PERSON>; and two plays that have already closed, `` Eastern Standard,'' by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Weller </PERSON>'s `` Spoils of War.'' <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON>'s `` Largely <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' a comedy with no dialogue, might also be a possibility for best play, although the <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> administration committee has not yet ruled if it will be eligible. There will be also be an absence of big names in the acting category categories. Only one possibility, <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON>, who plays <PERSON> Kafka </PERSON>'s tormented clerk in `` Metamorphosis,'' has superstar status. Best acting nominations could go to <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> and <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Garber </PERSON> of `` Lend Me a Tenor,'' <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> in `` Largely <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'' and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> of `` The <PERSON> Heidi </PERSON> <PERSON> Chronicles </PERSON>.'' And if they want a name recognized by television audiences, the committee could nominate <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Asner </PERSON> of `` Born Yesterday.'' The competition for best actress may be the most lively. Likely candidates include <PERSON> Pauline </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> of `` <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Valentine </PERSON>''; last year's winner <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> for `` The Heidi Chronicles''; <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelligan </PERSON> for the already-shuttered `` Spoils of War''; and <PERSON> Madeline </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON> who plays <PERSON> Billie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawn </PERSON> in the revival of `` Born Yesterday.'' The situation gets more desperate when you consider other musical categories. After <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, the genial emcee of `` <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>' Broadway,'' and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>'s critically panned portrayal of the title character in `` Legs Diamond,'' there were no real star roles for men on Broadway this season. For best actress in a musical, the nominating committee could reach back to <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> as the demented mother in long-gone `` Carrie,'' <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Sokol </PERSON>, the angry wife in `` Welcome to the Club'' or the trio of ladies _ <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> _ who star in `` Black and Blue.'' To save embarrassment, several musical categories might be eliminated. During the 1984-85 season _ the year that brought theatergoers such shows as `` Grind,'' `` Leader of the Pack'' and `` Quilters,'' there were no nominations for best actor and actress in a musical as well as for choreography. The awards show will be broadcast Sunday June 4 on <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION> with <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Lansbury </PERSON> serving as host for the third straight year.

 The musically chic Irish, basking in the glory of the Grammy-winning U2 rock band, are exporting an eclectic mix of talent typified by the distinctive styles of three female singers. From the high-tech lyricism of <PERSON> Enya </PERSON> to the seductive quasi-jazz of <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Coughlan </PERSON> and the punk-edged punch of <PERSON> Sinead </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, Irish music has gone far beyond fiddles, folksiness and lilting brogues. `` I do n't think it's anything to be feeling guilty about that we're not all carrying green leprechauns on our backs when we go on the road,'' said <PERSON> Coughlan </PERSON>, who sings about adultery, religious tyranny and urban chaos. The propulsion of <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>'s U2 by the 1985 Live Aid music extravaganza to the top of the rock music heap helped open the door for other Irish favorites seeking world stardom. `` This used to be a culture of begrudgers _ successful people always had to leave because they could n't live with the smallness, the conservatism. That has changed, changed forever,'' says <PERSON> Eamon </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunphy </PERSON>, author of `` Unforgettable Fire: The Story of U2.'' Disc jockey <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> McKenna </PERSON> of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Capitol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> says Irish pop music's appeal is its originality and thoughtfulness. It is a `` backlash against designer pop,'' he said in an interview. `` Radio listeners hear that and say, ` Wow! that's the way music is meant to sound.' It's predominantly music that is fresh, more natural, less image-conscious.'' U2's triumph has fueled a multimillion-dollar domestic music industry which enables those Irish who succeed on the world stage to keep roots at home, recording in dozens of newly built music studios. Despite a Time magazine cover, and inspiring millions of youngsters with their highly contemporary songs about drug abuse and racism, the four-man group remains based in the Irish capital. So do pop balladeer <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Burgh </PERSON>, the Van Morrison-style mysticism of Hothouse Flowers and emerging rock bands such as <PERSON> Aslam </PERSON> and Something Happens. Windmill Lane, <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>'s leading music studio, handles the home stars plus such major overseas talents as <ORGANIZATION> Def </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leppard </ORGANIZATION>, Status Quo, <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Costello </PERSON>, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Winwood </PERSON> and <PERSON> Terence </PERSON> <PERSON> Trent </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Arby </PERSON>. Irish artists used to have to beat down agents' doors in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Now a concert at the <ORGANIZATION> Baggot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inn </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>'s grimy, atmospheric music mecca, may attract half a dozen <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> talent scouts. The spotlight on <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> also has brought Irish traditional music to a wider record-buying audience, but often fused with rock, jazz and other influences by artists as varied as <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, <PERSON> Enya </PERSON>, The <ORGANIZATION> Pogues </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Davy </PERSON> <PERSON> Spillane </PERSON>. <PERSON> Spillane </PERSON> mixes the rhythms of Celtic reels, rock and bluegrass using uillean bagpipes and boghran drums with saxophone and electric rhythm sections. The <ORGANIZATION> London-Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pogues </ORGANIZATION> combine traditional acoustics with post-punk irreverence. <PERSON> Enya </PERSON> draws on traditional and classical styles in her album `` Watermark,'' an electronic soundscape that has sold more than 2 million copies worldwide. One track, `` Orinoco Flow,'' topped the British pop singles chart in November. Her crystalline voice is often layered, as many as 100 times, with harmonies and counterpoint melodies and wrapped in synthesizer swathes of instrumentals varying from clarinet and tin whistle to <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION> drums. <PERSON> Enya </PERSON>, 27, short for <PERSON> Eithne </PERSON> <PERSON> Ni </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhraonain </PERSON>, started out with <PERSON> Clannad </PERSON>, a folk-rock family band famous for its electrifying theme music for an adult TV version of `` Robin Hood.'' She works from a backyard studio in the <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> suburb of Artane with sound recordist <PERSON> Nicky </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Roma </PERSON>, who writes lyrics sung in English, Gaelic and Latin. She shrugs off descriptions of her music as `` Celtic New Age,'' `` transcendental'' or `` commercialized Irish mysticism.'' `` There is n't a category for it,'' <PERSON> Enya </PERSON> said in an interview. `` For me personally, it's got every title that's possible.'' <PERSON> Sinead </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, 22, who also defies pigeonholing, has won plaudits for her self-produced debut album, `` The Lion and the Cobra,'' a largely autobiographical exploration of adolescence. Her trademarks are a shaved head and a harrowing, defiant voice that expresses emotions in tonal leaps and swerves. <PERSON> Coughlan </PERSON>, 32, who sings soul with a <LOCATION> Galway </LOCATION> accent, has built a solid reputation across northern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> through three albums and frequent touring. `` The likes of U2 and <PERSON> Sinead </PERSON> and myself work hard to build up a live following first,'' she said from her new base of <LOCATION> Howth </LOCATION>, a fishing village overlooking <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. `` I do n't think any of those bands that are successful in the charts have ever gigged in their life. It's purely magazines, videos and disco. `` There's always been pop music around, but I do n't think it's ever been as bad Anything that's good that's been in the charts in the past five years has been rereleased oldies.'' <PERSON> Coughlan </PERSON> sings about `` prostitution, junkies, alcohol abuse, relationships _ they're all political in their own way. In `` My Land Is Too Green,'' she pokes fun at the dominance of the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in a state that outlaws divorce and `` exports its problems for foreign solutions'' _ a reference to <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> women who have to go to <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> to have abortions. The <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> conflict still provides fodder for songwriters, but the anti-British republican ballad tradition carried on by <PERSON> Christy </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> is now contrasted with tragic, non-sectarian interpretations. The Pogues, championing the innocence of 10 Irish people jailed for <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> bombings in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, wrote of `` being Irish in the wrong place at the wrong time.'' The song was banned last year by some British radio stations which feared it might be interpreted as giving comfort to the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>. In `` Sunday Bloody Sunday,'' U2's lead singer <PERSON> Bono </PERSON> laments: `` The trenches dug within our hearts _ And mothers, children, brothers, sisters torn apart.'' `` Up here we sacrifice our children _ To feed the worn-out dreams of yesterday,'' echoes Northern Ireland-born <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> in his folk-soft rock album `` Back to the Center.'' `` <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> is able to hold its head up now as much as anywhere else,'' said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Fanning </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s foremost rock deejay. `` U2 deserve full praise because they opened the door,'' he said. `` They put <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> on the map. The success, the staying-at-home, the doing-it-here helps other people to realize we can do it as well.''

 Before agreeing to star in `` Say Anything,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cusack </PERSON> insisted on a few changes. First of all, the script. `` The essence was there, but it needed to be fleshed out,'' said the 22-year-old actor, who portrays <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Dobler </PERSON>, a down-to-earth high school senior in love with the class valedictorian -LRB- <PERSON> Ione </PERSON> <PERSON> Skye </PERSON> -RRB-. `` I saw things inherent in the structure but I said, ` If you want me to do the film, I'm going have to do this, this and this. I'm not going to do this, this and this.' `` He -LRB- writer-director <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> -RRB- said, ` Great, bring it on.' I was very flattered and grateful they trusted me enough.'' Then came the wardrobe. `` I'm at the point where I costume myself. I went in and met with the costume designer, who to me is someone who tries to find out what I'm going for and helps me along that way. This costume designer had a whole rack full of clothes. There were V-neck sweaters and corduroy pants. `` I said, ` I will never wear anything on this rack, anything like this rack. Go get me a ` Clash' T-shirt. Go get met me a trenchcoat. Get me hats, different high-top sneakers.''' Finally, there was the matter of <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, who has written extensively about rock music and authored the best-selling account of teen-age life, `` Fast Times at Ridgemont High,'' later made into a feature film. <PERSON> Cusack </PERSON> hesitated to work with a first-time director but was impressed by <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>'s enthusiasm. `` He was really persistent. He flew out to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and handed me a copy of ` Catcher in the Rye.' He said, ` You're 21 years old, you're never going to be able to play a younger guy again. Why not end it with a positive note.'' <PERSON> Cusack </PERSON>, who has also starred in `` The Sure Thing,'' `` Eight Men Out'' and `` Tapeheads,'' was determined to make <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> believeable, wanting to avoid another angry young man such as <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON>, or the `` so hip and so cute'' teen-agers portrayed by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON>. `` Here's a guy who knows what's going on in the world, who's emotionally political,'' <PERSON> Cusack </PERSON> said of his character `` He's a pretty smart guy who just does n't have the skills to express himself. He does n't buy into the hype. He does n't believe the hype. He's not negative. He's not going to be a negative force in the world. He ca n't live his life in a negative way. `` We -LRB- <PERSON> Cusack </PERSON> and <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> -RRB- had a great rapport about what was right for <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>. By the end of the film, he would start a sentence and I would finish it.'' <PERSON> Cusack </PERSON>, the brother of actress <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cusack </PERSON> -LRB- `` Working Girl,'' `` Broadcast News'' -RRB- and son of documentary filmamker <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Cusack </PERSON>, grew up in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and was just 9 when he began taking classes at the <ORGANIZATION> Piven </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theatre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workshop </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Evanston </LOCATION>, Ill. He had minor roles in the movies `` Sixteen Candles'' and `` Class'' before being cast by director <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Reiner </PERSON> for the lead in `` The Sure Thing.'' `` I was amped, just ready to go. I was n't smart enough to be nervous. I was just excited to be working with <PERSON> Rob </PERSON>,'' recalled <PERSON> Cusack </PERSON>, who would later work with <PERSON> Reiner </PERSON> on `` Stand by Me.'' `` I just really dug his work process, it was real similar to mine. <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> is this guy who directs by saying, ` Match my passion.' There was great energy on the set.'' But <PERSON> Cusack </PERSON> went on to appear in a series of poorly received films, including `` Better Off Dead'' and `` One Crazy Summer.'' He became frustrated from reading an endless number of bad scripts, and admitted that his career was `` in the pits.'' `` I remember reading the script for, ` Some Kind of Wonderful.' They wanted me do that. At the end of the film the guy takes all this college money to buy a jet, a Cadillac, a helicopter. He completely woos this girl with material possessions and symbols of wealth. What kind of story is that?'' He was happier making films such as `` Tapeheads,'' a parody of the music video business that starred <PERSON> Cusack </PERSON> and his friend, <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>, as a pair of sleazy producers. `` We were so sick of these run-of-the mill scripts _ same characters, same plots, not funny, not fresh. Somebody sent me this script called ` Tapeheads,' and we saw the name and said, ` Let's do it.' `` It sounded really sick,'' he said. `` It was a black comedy on the music business and I got to finally play a guy who was n't a good guy, who would sell out his mother for the right price.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ When movie stars headed for the wide-open spaces to film their Westerns, they often stayed at the El Rancho Hotel in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. But just as the Westerns faded in popularity, so did the old hotel. Now it's trying for a comeback, counting on nostalgia for the golden age of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> and a cowboy motif.

 It's a roster of the stars of yesteryear, with names like <PERSON> Errol </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogart </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON>, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Montez </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Mix </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mayo </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>. The names adorn the doors of guest rooms throughout the <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rancho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION>, which owes its birth to <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>. The hotel was built in 1937 by the brother of movie magnate <PERSON> D.W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> to house the actors and actresses who were then flocking to the wide-open spaces and red bluffs of northwestern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to make movies, mostly Westerns. On famed Route 66, the hotel played host to the famous, the near-famous and the once-famous for decades. But as Westerns faded, so did <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Rancho </PERSON>. It went through a series of owners, finally ending up on the auction block in a bankruptcy foreclosure 50 years after its grand opening. Gallup businessman <PERSON> Armand </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> bought the one-time showplace for $ 500,000 and spent about another $ 500,000 restoring it, says his daughter, <PERSON> Amelia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowther </PERSON>, manager-bookkeeper for El Rancho. The hotel _ which looks a bit like an oversized ranch house _ reopened in May 1988, its original motto of `` Charm of Yesterday, Convenience of Tomorrow'' intact in neon above the entrance. The hotel's huge, brick-floored, two-story lobby was restored to its Western flavor, a lariat surrounding the mirror behind the check-in counter, silver dollars embedded in the counter itself. The lobby's centerpiece is a huge arched rock and brick fireplace into which the original mason cut a cardplayer's diamond, club, spade and heart _ appropriate since there once was open gambling at the big hotel. Near the lobby, on a wooden bench and a chair made of steer horns, sit wooden Indians. The lobby walls and railings are festooned with big game trophies, Navajo rugs and Indian and Western art. A rustic, curving double staircase, the carpeted steps made of logs sawed in half, flows gracefully up either side of the fireplace to a wide balcony that encircles the main room. The walls of the balcony are lined with black-and-white photographs. There are scenes from movies filmed in the area such as `` <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Ranger,'' starring <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> MacMurray </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON>; `` Ambush,'' with <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>; `` The Streets of <LOCATION> Laredo </LOCATION>,'' starring <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Holden </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendix </PERSON>; `` Rocky Mountain,'' with <PERSON> Errol </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>; `` <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Territory </ORGANIZATION>,'' with <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> McCrea </PERSON>; `` Pursued,'' starring <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchum </PERSON>. There are photographs _ dozens of them _ of stars such as the <ORGANIZATION> Marx </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ladd </PERSON>, <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogart </PERSON>, <PERSON> Katharine </PERSON> <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lew </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayres </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> of the television show `` The Lawman,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> and the Fondas, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>, across the balcony from each other. Some photographs are autographed, often to <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanks </PERSON>, the hotel's first manager. At one end of the balcony is a picture of <PERSON> Clair </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurley </PERSON>. A salesman, he was the first person to stay at <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION> when it opened in 1937. Ms. <PERSON> Crowther </PERSON> says that when <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> reopened the hotel in 1988, he invited <PERSON> Gurley </PERSON> back _ and charged him the original $ 5-a-night price. Today's rates range from $ 32 to $ 49. The three-story hotel, still serviced by its original hand-cranked elevator, has 70 rooms. Each room is labeled with the name of a star who, research shows, probably stayed in that very room, Ms. <PERSON> Crowther </PERSON> says. However, there's at least one exception. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> stayed at El Rancho a couple of times while making a movie and filming `` Death Valley Days'' for television, but Ms. <PERSON> Crowther </PERSON> says today's <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> room is one that probably is n't labeled accurately El Rancho originally had a hierarchy of rooms, the best ones in an area by themselves. One of the best is now the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> room, but that probably has more to do with him being president than being a star. `` I'd guess <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> never stayed in the <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> room because he was n't an ` A' star,'' Ms. <PERSON> Crowther </PERSON> says. `` He was a B-movie star.'' The hotel keeps jelly beans, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s favorite snack, in the room. And if someone orders the <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> sandwich from the dining room, that, too, comes with jelly beans. There are rooms with the names of <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, <PERSON> Groucho </PERSON> <PERSON> Marx </PERSON>, W.C. Fields, <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Benny </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> Crowther </PERSON> says, once joked about ordering a pay phone for the <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> room, in keeping with the running gag about the star's stinginess. Ms. <PERSON> Crowther </PERSON> says guests often ask for a room named for a particular star. The choices also include the names of <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Remick </PERSON>, <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Akins </PERSON>, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Grable </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rosalind </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Lancaster </PERSON>, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Holden </PERSON>, <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> Manning </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Crowther </PERSON> admits she does n't know who all the stars are _ <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> Manning </PERSON>, for instance. The rooms have been refurbished to close-to-original state, Ms. <PERSON> Crowther </PERSON> says. One of El Rancho's previous owners had paneled them, but <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> had the paneling ripped out and the walls replastered white. He also had the rooms furnished with rustic-looking furniture, such as beds with wagon-wheel headboards. Several rooms have the original furniture, the light oak oiled after being rescued from under a thick coating of chocolate brown paint. All the rooms have ceiling fans, since air-conditioning was not put in when the hotel was originally built half a century ago. It does have air-conditioning now, so guests no longer must go out onto the roof to get a breath of cool air as they did in the old days. Among the photographs displayed on the second-floor balcony is one showing <PERSON> Katharine </PERSON> <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON>, stars of `` The Sea of Grass,'' sitting on <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION>'s roof with the movie's director, who is not identified. The guest rooms now have tiny bathrooms, added in an early renovation. Except for rooms for big stars, the original hotel did not have bathrooms in each room, but rather had `` baths down the hall,'' Ms. <PERSON> Crowther </PERSON> says. Since its reopening, <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Rancho </PERSON> mostly has played host to ordinary folk. But there have been a couple of stars. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Gross </PERSON> of television's `` Family Ties'' ate at the hotel's dining room one day And Goldie Hawn stayed at El Rancho last summer on her way from <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` She was very nice,'' Ms. <PERSON> Crowther </PERSON> says. `` She stood in front of the fireplace and let people take pictures, and signed autographs.''

<HEAD>If Feds Allow, Baby Bell Will Edge Into Cable TV</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In a move that may test the limits of federal regulation of the telephone industry, <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telesis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> hopes to become the first of the old Bell System companies to buy into cable TV. The nation's cable system operators vow to fight Pacific's plans, fearing that the phone companies' far greater financial resources will muscle aside competition and concerned that telephone companies may, if allowed by the federal government to buy in, be able within a few years to provide phone and television service through a single cable The initial battleground is <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> announced last month it intends to buy an interest _ worth more than $ 100 million _ in a system serving 97,000 homes in the Windy City. Before that can happen, though, <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> must win approval from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and from the federal judge who oversees operations of the seven regional telephone companies that were created with the breakup of the Bell System in 1984. The seven `` Baby Bells'' have been barred by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Districe Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> from generating information services, including cable TV programming, out of fear they could use their vast financial resources to compete unfairly. But the regional companies, including <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, are allowed to enter the cable television business outside their telephone service areas if they can show they will not use their monopoly powers to impede competition in the cable market they enter. <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> announced April 20 it had reached a tentative agreement to buy, through a series of transactions, a 68 percent interest in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> system. Now owned by Group W, the system would be purchased for $ 198 million by an affiliate of Prime Cable of <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Prime would operate the system, which serves 97,000 customers in a franchise area of 410,000 homes. One telecommunications industry analyst, <PERSON> Berge </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayvazian </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, said the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> deal had been `` very carefully structured ... to test the limits'' of <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>'s restrictions on the Baby Bells' operatons `` This is a breakthrough for them if they get away with it,'' he added. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has already approved <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>'s plans. The company intends to ask <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> for a waiver this summer. The Bell companies, particularly <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, have been pecking away at the fringes of the cable business while hoping that someday they will be free to compete fully in cable TV. <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> must persuade <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> that a waiver would not impede the operations and profit potential of other <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> cable systems. `` They stand a pretty good chance of getting the waiver,'' said <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Geller </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> official and director of <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>. `` They're clearly going to argue ... they do n't have a monopoly in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>.'' An association representing cable operators will argue before <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> that granting <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> a waiver would substantially undercut his 1984 decree. `` We support the consent decree, which is premised on justifiable fears of telephone companies using their huge monopoly phone business to cross-subsidize -LRB- cable operations -RRB- and otherwise impede competiton,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Mooney </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, an industry trade group. `` One of the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Baby </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bells </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- has a gross revenue base that is as large as the entire cable television industry,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Effros </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Antenna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, another cable operators' trade group. Besides concerns that the phone companies' very size could radically alter their industry, cable operators fear that the fiber-optic cables being installed by phone companies to replace copper wires could one day eliminate the need for a separate cable to deliver television signals to customers. Telephone companies are replacing thousands of miles of wire each year with fiber cables, those pencil-thin bundles of glass strands capable of transmitting enormous amounts of information on beams of laser light. If extended directly to customers' homes, a single fiber-optic cable could at the same time carry television signals, telephone calls and computer data. Southwestern Bell and <ORGANIZATION> Sammons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> are testing new cable technology in the <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, area, and the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> last week allowed a non-Bell company, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, to construct a system using both conventional coaxial cable, made of copper, and fiber-optic cable in <LOCATION> Cerritos </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> suburb that also gets its phone service from the <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary. Cable industry critics say that it will cost telephone companies $ 500 billion to completely convert to fiber optics and that selling TV programming would be a fine way to make up the expense. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION>, another of the <ORGANIZATION> Baby </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bells </ORGANIZATION>, told broadcasters last week in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> that only by allowing telephone companies to provide video programming will a full fiber optic network _ with the cables extending to individual homes _ be completed in this century. `` In my view, only one factor could accelerate this timetable dramatically _ allowing telephone companies to cover the costs of fiber-to-the-home with revenues'' from a range of services, including television transmission. Many in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and at the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> think it is time to unleash the telephone companies to compete in the information service and telecommunications equipment-manufacturing businesses. Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> concerned about such things, such as Reps. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich.; <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Swift </PERSON>, D-Wash., and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Tauke </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, want to relieve <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> of his oversight of the Bell Last month, they introduced legislation to lift those two restraints on the Bell companies. While the bill would not let the <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> companies into cable TV, there is a growing feeling that the existing cable TV industry could stand a little competition. <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> has said repeatedly that the federal government should now establish rules to assure that fiber-optic phone lines carry a `` cornucopia'' of voice, video and data into the nation's homes. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> began relaxing its restrictions on phone companies' entry into cable television last July, when it voted to consider recommending to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that the companies be allowed into cable TV even in the regions where they provide phone service The commission also suggested it would try to encourge telephone companies to enter cable TV if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> fails to act by broadly defining `` good cause'' for waivers from its existing regulations. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> said it probably would grant waivers if telephone companies wire homes with fiber and allow competitors to use those cables to sell video programs too. With this writing on the wall, many cable TV executives are looking to involve telephone companies as partners in cable systems outside telephone company service areas. `` There' a major split within the cable industry on that issue,'' <PERSON> Effros </PERSON> said. `` Frankly, I do n't think many cable operators would disagree that we could live with telephone companies'' outside their service areas. `` Their money is as green as anyone else's and the amounts of money needed to continually improve cable TV ... is massive, so it would be nice to get a new influx of money,'' <PERSON> Effros </PERSON> said.

 Despite President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s `` read my lips'' vow against new taxes, his administration is considering higher gasoline taxes for 1991 as part of a possible trade for concessions such as a lower capital gains tax, officials said. Administration sources said Monday it is unlikely <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> can hold his no-new-taxes stance for more than one year, given the difficulty of reaching budget-deficit targets by adjusting only the spending side of the ledger.

 <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Controls </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> has agreed to buy the security and maintenance unit of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the companies announced Monday. The sale price, in cash, wo n't be disclosed until the sale is completed sometime during the second quarter, the companies said Monday. The transaction is subject to regulatory approval. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>, strapped by losses from <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, its main subsidiary, put its <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> unit up for sale in January. The subsidiary, based in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, markets security, maintenance and other services to government agencies, the military and other airlines. World Services, with about 10,000 employees at over 100 locations worldwide, had revenue of $ 600 million in 1988. Financial analysts estimate the unit's potential sale value at around $ 200 million. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> Controls provides operations services on a contract basis to airports, sports arenas, schools, hospitals and other facilities. The company, which had revenue of $ 3.1 billion in 1988, also makes heating and cooling controls, automotive seating, batteries and plastics. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>'s Northeast shuttle service and <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>, a commuter airline, also are considered profitable operations. But they are more closely tied to <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>'s main airline business than is the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> unit. Some analysts hav wondered whether the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> move represents a new <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> strategy to sell performing assets rather than strip away parts of loss-making <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, such as routes and airport facilities. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> officials say the sale of <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> is designed to help finance the company's planned investments for the near future.

<HEAD>WPP Likely To Succeed In Ogilvy Bid, Analysts Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 Industry analysts expect <ORGANIZATION> Ogilvy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to fight a takeover from London-based <ORGANIZATION> WPP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, but ultimately they expect <ORGANIZATION> WPP </ORGANIZATION> will succeed in creating an ad agency holding company that will vie for the title of world's largest. Wall Street reacted enthsiastically Monday to the $ 730 million <ORGANIZATION> WPP </ORGANIZATION> bid, disclosed Sunday, bidding up the price of <ORGANIZATION> Ogilvy </ORGANIZATION>'s stock more that $ 17 and surpassing <ORGANIZATION> WPP </ORGANIZATION>'s bid. <ORGANIZATION> WPP </ORGANIZATION> Chief Executive <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorrell </PERSON> has proposed to pay $ 45 a share for the parent of the advertising agency <ORGANIZATION> Ogilvy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Mather Worldwide. <PERSON> Ogilvy </PERSON>'s stock soared $ 17.12 -LCB- a share to close at $ 49.12 -LCB- Monday in over-the-counter trading. If the deal goes through, it would be the biggest takeover of an advertising holding firm ever, breaking the record set by <ORGANIZATION> WPP </ORGANIZATION>'s purchase of <ORGANIZATION> JWT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, parent of <ORGANIZATION> J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thompson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, two years ago <PERSON> Ogilvy </PERSON>, meanwhile, says it wants to remain independent. `` Mr. <PERSON> Sorrell </PERSON>'s proposal letter to <PERSON> Ogilvy </PERSON> appears primarily to be a sales pitch which suffers from serious flaws in business logic,'' <ORGANIZATION> Ogilvy </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> said in a statement Sunday. Analysts said the British firm would likely win the fight. `` There's a real possibility that <PERSON> Sorrell </PERSON> will succeed,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Anschel </PERSON>, an advertising industry analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, adding that many shareholders would find <ORGANIZATION> WPP </ORGANIZATION>'s all-cash offer hard to turn down `` They have some -LRB- defenses -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dougherty </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NatWest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>. `` But I do n't think they have enough to resist a bid that I think ultimately will go into the mid-50s.'' The deal would create an advertising and marketing holding company that would rival <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Saatchi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Saatchi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> as the world's largest. <ORGANIZATION> WPP </ORGANIZATION> had international billings last year of $ 7.8 billion, ranking it third among the world's ad agency holding companies, according to Advertising Age, a trade publication. <PERSON> Ogilvy </PERSON>, with billings of $ 5.7 billion, placed fifth. Combined, their billings would have about equaled <ORGANIZATION> Saatchi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Saatchi </PERSON>'s $ 13.5 billion. An industry source said <ORGANIZATION> WPP </ORGANIZATION> wants to become the best multinational marketing service and not necessarly the biggest.

Analysts said <ORGANIZATION> WPP </ORGANIZATION>'s latest proposal was more a result of <PERSON> Sorrell </PERSON>'s expansion plans rather than any problems at <LOCATION> Ogilvy </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ogilvy </PERSON> `` seems to fit in pretty well with <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorrell </PERSON>'s goals,'' said <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` This is not a company that was begging to be taken over. <PERSON> Said </PERSON> <PERSON> Anschel </PERSON>, the Dean <PERSON> Witter </PERSON> analyst, `` The biggest knock against them -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Ogilvy </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- is their earings have been basically flat since 1985.'' But, he said, `` It has a very fine brand-name in the advertising business.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Strikebound </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, downplaying proposals from suitors interested in buying the entire carrier, indicated it was speeding ahead with its plan to sell $ 1.8 billion in assets separately. In a filing submitted Monday to federal bankruptcy court in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> disclosed it had firm sales contracts or received acceptable offers for about $ 1.1 billion of its assets. Those assets include <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> shuttle service, already slated to be sold to developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> for $ 365 million, airport gates in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and routes between that city and others, said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON>. He declined to elaborate on the non-shuttle deals. Another $ 300 million in asset sales `` are subject to serious discussion where reasonable offers have been received,'' while an additional $ 400 million in sales are being discussed with `` responsible and interested parties,'' <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> said in the filing. The Miami-based airline said it expects to announce several deals in the coming weeks. All such sales must be approved by the federal bankruptcy court overseeing the airline's Chapter 11 reorganization under protection from creditors. Eastern's Machinists, pilots and flight attendants unions, which have been off the job since March 4, have opposed sales of the airline's assets. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> has pushed to have the company sold in its entirety and has scheduled a Wednesday hearing for arguments over why such an auction of the whole airline _ including the shuttle _ should not take place. In its filing, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> said it recently received an offer from billionaire hotel executive <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON> to buy all of the airline. Eastern described the offer as `` at best, a generalized expression of interest.'' On Friday, a statement was issued on behalf of a group of unidentified <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> financial institutions that indicated the consortium was developing a proposal under which it might pay $ 1 billion for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> if the deal included assets sold by the airline since its 1986 acquisition by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. An attorney for the group later said the statement was issued in error but the group actually was formulating a proposal Eastern, in its filing, countered that the group lacks `` the financial resources to consummate any purchase and, indeed, has only the vaguest hope of obtaining such resources.'' Takeover strategist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, who owns <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, has expressed interest and was expected to submit a formal bid in the near future. Eastern plans to restructure to operate at one-third its pre-strike size and raise $ 1.8 billion to pay debts by selling planes, airport gates and landing slots at unspecified locations. As a first step, the airline announced plans Thursday to lease 14 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727-200s to <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> for $ 96.6 million over five years. All transactions and any sale of the entire airline must be approved by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bankruptcy court, where Eastern filed for protection from creditors on March 9. However, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> ca n't be compelled under the bankruptcy laws to sell <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> in its entirety if it does not want to. Eastern management has the exclusive right until early July to present a reorganization plan for court approval. Eastern's <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union struck the carrier on March 4 after a long wage dispute. They were joined by pilots and flight attendants, virtually grounding the airline and forcing it to seek bankruptcy protection five days later. Eastern said Monday its non-union employees have delivered petitions with more than 6,200 signatures to the bankruptcy court expressing their support for the plan to rebuild as a smaller carrier.

 As a crippling strike at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> heads into its third month, the carrier's unions say they remain solid, although some employees _ union and management _ are bailing out. <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON>, a company spokeswoman, ca n't estimate how many of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s 12,000 non-union employees have taken other jobs since the March 4 strike by the company's <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION>, pilots and flight attendants virtually grounded the airline. `` As more time passes, more people will go on to other things,'' she said. The <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union estimates that departures among Eastern's 17,000 union workers number only in the hundreds, although nearly all of the remaining union employees still refuse to work for the airline Eastern has cut back to 10 percent of pre-strike operations, has about 4,500 active employees and has entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization and protection from creditors. <ORGANIZATION> Parent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> plans to rebuild Eastern as a smaller airline without the unions. But the unions are optimistic that new ownership for the entire airline still can be found, even though <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> insists that none of the offers it has received are viable. <PERSON> Wally </PERSON> <PERSON> Haber </PERSON>, general chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union, chuckled recently when reminded of his March 4 prediction that the strike would last only 10 days. Eastern's March 9 bankruptcy filing `` threw a monkey wrench into the whole system,'' putting the company into the slow-moving procedures of bankruptcy court, he said. <PERSON> Haber </PERSON>, noting that few of the 8,500 Eastern machinists were around for the last Eastern strike, for 42 days in 1966, said: `` I've been amazed at the resolve, the way the people are really sticking together.'' <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and several other companies have been wooing Eastern mechanics, <PERSON> Haber </PERSON> said, but the union estimates departures have been only in the hundreds. He said about one-third of the union membership is working at some type of job, but most are temporary or part time. Officials at the pilots union _ whose members would sacrifice seniority that determines their salaries and flight assignments if they switched airlines _ say there have been few departures. Flight attendants union officials say many of their members have taken other jobs but would prefer to return o Eastern if possible. Strikers have been aided somewhat by their own union benefits _ Machinists receive $ 100 a week in union strike benefits and the pilots $ 2,400 a month _ and from elsewhere in organized labor. The <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> has about $ 1 million for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> strikers, with the financially-strapped flight attendants union set to receive two-thirds of that amount. Thousands of dollars worth of groceries and frozen meats have been donated to the unions, <PERSON> Haber </PERSON> said, and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> farmers have invited crews of strikers to come to their fields for all the vegetables they could pick. `` The economic situation is different now than it was 23 years ago,'' Haber said. `` Over half of our people have two jobs in the family.'' Many non-union employees _ who have no strike benefits _ ca n't afford to be as patient, especially given the uncertainty of what the ultimate resolution of the strike will be <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Madsen </PERSON>, former manager of Eastern benefits compensation, moved March 20 to Southeast Banks for a similar job offering more money and more security. `` I hope they make it and in a way I'd sort of like to be there,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Madsen </PERSON>. `` After 19 years, there's still a place in my heart for Eastern. But I could n't afford to take the financial risk and I got the opportunity to go with a good company.'' Among pilots, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s generally are some of industry's most experienced, the pilots union says. But although other major carriers are anxious to hire experienced pilots, the Eastern veterans are reluctant to trade their seniority for new jobs elsewhere. `` The seniority repercussions ... are more acceptable to a younger gentleman at lower seniority levels, as opposed to me when I've been here 16 years,'' said pilot <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Greksa </PERSON> Within a couple of years at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Greksa </PERSON> said, he would move from his $ 65,000-a-year job as a senior co-pilot to captain. At another airline, he said, he would have to sign on at an initial, probationary salary of $ 18,000, rising to $ 25,000 as a second officer the year after that. `` That's why we're staying to fight,'' he said. But many pilots nevertheless have applied to other airlines, <PERSON> Greksa </PERSON> said. `` We all buy life insurance, but we do n't want to die,'' he said. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubois </PERSON>, an Eastern mechanic since 1980, is among strikers who have other jobs but still hope to return to Eastern. The 35-year-old married father of one, facing mortgage payments, has started his own home improvement business with another Eastern Machinist. <PERSON> Dubois </PERSON> and friends who also have taken new jobs remain optimistic about working again for Eastern under new management. `` We love the job when we do n't think about the last three years,'' <PERSON> Dubois </PERSON> said. `` We want to go back. We left a part of our lives there.''

 An investment adviser for drugstore giant <ORGANIZATION> Revco </ORGANIZATION> D.S. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and seven investors have agreed to surrender profits and pay fines totaling nearly $ 1.8 million for alleged insider trading, the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> says. The federal agency filed a complaint Monday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> accusing <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Golenberg </PERSON> of suburban <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON> <PERSON> Pike </PERSON>, president and owner of <ORGANIZATION> Golenberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, of telling outsiders that management was considering a debt-financed takeover of the company before the plan was announced three years ago. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> said it was the first time an individual was fined for violations of insider trading regulations without having made any trades. Seven people or their clients eventually earned a total of $ 735,000 by trading in <ORGANIZATION> Revco </ORGANIZATION> stock, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> said. Federal securities laws prohibit trading stocks based on non-public information. The defendants have agreed to repay their profits and nearly $ 1 million in fines, without admitting or denying guilt, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Golenberg </PERSON> agreed to pay a $ 470,000 penalty and consented to an <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> order barring him from acting as a broker, dealer or investment adviser for at least four years. The Twinsburg-based <ORGANIZATION> Revco </ORGANIZATION> was purchased through a management-led takeover known as a leveraged buyout that was financed mostly with borrowed money. The company filed for bankruptcy protection last July because it could n't pay its $ 1.5 billion debt. No other large leveraged buyout has run into such serious debt trouble. <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Obert </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Revco </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said <PERSON> Golenberg </PERSON> is a <ORGANIZATION> Revco </ORGANIZATION> board member because of his stock holdings, amounting to 150,000 <ORGANIZATION> Revco </ORGANIZATION> shares as of last May 28. `` <ORGANIZATION> Revco </ORGANIZATION> was the biggest deal of my life,'' he said in a statement after the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> filed the complaint. `` It was constantly on my mind, something I lived and breathed. Regrettably, I talked about it with a few people who did not have any right to know what was going on. I now realize the seriousness of that lapse of judgment.'' In the same complaint, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> accused <PERSON> Golenberg </PERSON> of providing information to <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Saltzman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> about the proposed merger of two smaller firms, <ORGANIZATION> Magnetics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Maple </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> and H.K. <ORGANIZATION> Porter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Saltzman </PERSON> made $ 6,850 buying and selling 2,000 shares of <ORGANIZATION> Magnetics </ORGANIZATION> common stock and made $ 27,326 purchasing and selling <ORGANIZATION> Revco </ORGANIZATION> stock, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Saltzman </PERSON> agreed to repay the money and an equal fine. `` I should have known better,'' <PERSON> Golenberg </PERSON> said of the portion of the complaint dealing with <ORGANIZATION> Magnetics </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Obert </PERSON> declined to comment on <PERSON> Golenberg </PERSON>'s settlement, saying `` that's entirely between the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> and Mr. Golenberg.'' She said the company has prepared a five-year business plan for reorganization but it has not been filed with the federal bankruptcy court yet. The other investors accused in the complaint of profiting from inside information about the <ORGANIZATION> Revco </ORGANIZATION> buyout, are: _ <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shavitz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Woodcliff </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, a business associate of <PERSON> Golenberg </PERSON>'s The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Shavitz </PERSON> made $ 214,000 buying and selling <ORGANIZATION> Revco </ORGANIZATION> stock and is asking that <PERSON> Shavitz </PERSON> repay the money along with a fine of $ 214,000. _ <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, described as a friend of <PERSON> Golenberg </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON> is accused of earning $ 65,000 trading <ORGANIZATION> Revco </ORGANIZATION> stock and leaking inside information to the remaining defendants. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> required him to surrender the profits and a pay a $ 75,000 fine. _ <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Lightman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, accused of earning $ 215,218 trading <ORGANIZATION> Revco </ORGANIZATION> stock He agreed to repay the money and an equal fine. _ <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Adler </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, an account executive with the former <ORGANIZATION> E.F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, is accused of earning $ 38,188 for himself and $ 141,820 for clients He agreed to pay $ 180,008 in illicit profits and a $ 19,992 fine. _ <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> is accused of making $ 31,000 trading <ORGANIZATION> Revco </ORGANIZATION> stock He agreed to repay the money and an equal fine. _ <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reiter </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Germantown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, is accused of making $ 2,625 as a result of the inside information He agreed to repay the money and an equal fine.

 <ORGANIZATION> Kollmorgen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a maker of electrical and optical equipment, has agreed to be taken over by the smaller <ORGANIZATION> Vernitron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 25 a share, or about $ 250 million, ending a five-month battle. The agreement Monday followed two weeks of maneuvering by Stamford-based <ORGANIZATION> Kollmorgen </ORGANIZATION> as it searched for another buyer and a better offer for shareholders. The merger still depends on the approval of <ORGANIZATION> Kollmorgen </ORGANIZATION> shareholders and financing. The merger would create a larger technology company, with products in optics and electronics and more than $ 400 million in annual sales. The combined assets and sales would provide a larger base needed to support advanced research and development at <ORGANIZATION> Vernitron </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Deerfield </LOCATION>, N.Y.-based company that specializes in electromechanical devices, officials said. Officials said <ORGANIZATION> Vernitron </ORGANIZATION> is positioning itself for the unification of the European Common Market in 1992.

 The dollar rose in early European trading today following a three-day May Day holiday weekend in most financial capitals. Gold prices fell.

 Share prices were mostly lower in lackluster trading at midday Tuesday, as the market ran out of reasons to extend last week's strong gains after a three-day holiday weekend, traders said. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was down 8.1 points, or 0.3 percent, at 2,109.9 at 12:17 p.m. The index opened 3.2 points down and then fell as much as 10.1 points at midmorning. Volume was 166.0 million shares by midday compared with 373.9 million shares on Friday. Fresh concern about the outlook for international interest rates took the wind from the market's sails at the outset of trading, but there was scant selling pressure to give the market much momentum, traders said. `` Very little volume, that's really characterizing the market at the moment,'' said one equities salesman. `` The institutions do want to come in. If opportunities presented themselves, if this market does come back a little more, then you will get some buying.''

 The only gasoline station in the small town of Echo, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, has closed and the same fate may be in store for a string of others, a result of tougher federal regulations on underground storage tanks. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gronquist </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> mayor and <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> franchise owner, said there soon may be no stations in the 160 miles between the <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> communities of <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON>. He said station owners and consumers are just beginning to feel the effects of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> regulations intended to prevent gasoline leaks from underground storage tanks. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> estimates 43 percent of all service stations in the nation with underground tanks will close within the first five years the policies are in effect. Gasoline station owners are being required to upgrade tanks, install leakage detection devices and obtain leakage accident insurance. Estimates of the cost range from $ 12,000 to $ 50,000 per station, not including insurance. `` We're going to lose all our service stations because nobody can afford it,'' said <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, owner of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s Chevrolet in Fossil. But <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Moyer </PERSON>, a state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quality </ORGANIZATION> tank specialist, noted that leakage from underground tanks has sometimes resulted in buildings being blown up or in contamination of a city's water supply. `` Entire communities could be left without water if somebody's tank leaked,'' <PERSON> Moyer </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON>, who owns the only station in <LOCATION> Ione </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> are taking the wrong approach. `` I think these people are kind of like the ostrich. They hide their heads in the sand and think it's going to go away, but it is n't,'' he said. `` The town needs this service,'' <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> added. In order to continue operating, <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> said he'd have to spend about $ 12,000 to install leakage detection devices on his two underground gasoline storage tanks. <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> also would be required to hold a $ 1 million insurance policy. `` Quite frankly, it's not good. It's going to close a lot of stations,'' <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> said of the regulations. `` I think if I had more money, I'd drop everything I was doing and go to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, and hound them until they hated me,'' <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Defense Contractor Objects To Suspension</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHANTILLY, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Fairchild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> says the decision by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Logistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> to suspend purchases from the company's <ORGANIZATION> Voi-Shan </ORGANIZATION> fastener division was an unnecessary precaution. In a statement Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Fairchild </ORGANIZATION> said it was surprised by the <ORGANIZATION> DLA </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to suspend Voi-Shan from new government contracts because of allegations that the division's employees had falsified testing data on aerospace fasteners. The suspension does not affect Fairchild's other federal contracts. Fairchild stock fell 1 -RRB- Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, closing at $ 16. That's $ 1 below the price offered by the <ORGANIZATION> Carlyle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, which is seeking to buy the company. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubenstein </PERSON>, managing partner of the <ORGANIZATION> Carlyle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, declined to comment on whether the suspension would affect the group's interest in Fairchild. `` We're studying it carefully,'' he said. Voi-Shan fastener sales to the government accounted for less than 2 percent of Fairchild's total 1988 revenues. However, a source quoted today by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said the suspension could scare away commercial customers. The suspension comes in the wake of a widespread <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> crackdown on faulty bolts. Several congressional and <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> investigations have revealed that bad fasteners in all types of military hardware and vehicles is a major problem. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said former and current employees have told investigators that they falsified test data when testing equipment did not work, when tests could not be accomplished in the allotted time, and when parts failed tests but management decided to approve them anyway. Fairchild said that shortly after learning of the allegations, it placed three Voi-Shan employees on administrative leave and conducted an extensive review of inventories. Fairchild said that no parts failure were found by Fairchild or its customers.

 <ORGANIZATION> U </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has begun enforcing a new smoking ban in its 2,900 buildings, including about 400 offices in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. Company officials said Monday that smoking will no longer be allowed in any of its buildings, nor at sites it rents for employee meetings. The policy is designed to protect the health of its 57,500 phone company employees in 14 western states, as well as eliminate the cost of providing smoking lounges, company officials said. At the same time, U S West is offering to reimburse employees up to $ 150 if they enroll in programs to end smoking. About 26 percent of the company's employees smoke, said <ORGANIZATION> U </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> U </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> _ the telephone services unit of <ORGANIZATION> U </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Englewood </LOCATION> _ employes nearly 12,000 workers in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, including some 9,800 in the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> metropolitan area alone. Besides company facilities in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, the ban went into effect Monday at locations in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. Smoking already was prohibited at company sites in the seven other states where <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> West operates. `` The bottom line is there's so much evidence that secondary smoke is harmful to those who do n't smoke that this is the way to go,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. The ban drew immediate criticism from the <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. A spokesman said the ban could become an issue in talks on a new labor contract, scheduled to begin next month. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Belkin </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 7777 </ORGANIZATION>, which represents 6,500 U S West workers, is concerned the ban will be enforced unequally between hourly workers and corporate officers. `` We hope to monitor the situation to make sure the company enforced things in an equitable fashion,'' <PERSON> Belkin </PERSON> said. `` The question is whether they're concerned about productivity or whether it's a means to control people's individual choices.'' All the corporate concern failed to convince die-hard smokers of the danger. Clustered in twos and threes Monday, sitting outside the downtown <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> building Monday, a contingent of employees grabbed a puff. `` I like to smoke, and I'll quit when I want to, not because of some rule,'' said <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, a 16-year employee of the phone company and a 17-year smoker.

<HEAD>Trade Association Predicts Inflation Will Drop In 1989</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's purchasing managers predict inflation will total 3.8 percent this year, down from the 5 percent they reported last year, a trade association said today. The inflation figures are part of a semi-annual economic forecast by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Purchasing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, which represents 30,000 purchasing agents around the country. The group is holding its annual conference in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> this week. Forty-five percent of the members surveyed said they expected their capital expenditures to rise in 1989 while 24 percent said they expected their expenditures to drop below the 1988 level. `` Although this ration of almost 2-to-1 predicts a strong year for capital expenditures, the increase over 1988 is not expected to be as great as 1988 was over 1987,'' the forecast said. Most of the purchasers said they were paying higher prices in mid-April than at the end of last year. The forecast said the purchasers saw prices increase an average of 2.9 percent in the first 4 -LCB- months of this year, but expect inflation to be more moderate during the rest of the year.

<HEAD>Oilman Hammering Out A Sequel To `Hammer' At Company's Expense</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which usually spends money to dig for oil, now is digging into the recent past of Chairman <PERSON> Armand </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON> at a cost of $ 367,000, according to a proxy statement sent to shareholders. The company is footing the bill for a sequel to the 91-year-old industrialist's 1987 autobiography `` Hammer,'' with publication expected next year, said <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>. `` ` Hammer' only went through 1985,'' <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> said. `` This book tells of more recent activities at <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> and of Dr. Hammer's activities around the world. <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> said the boss has had a busy 3 -LCB- years. In 1986, for example, Hammer helped pay for medical treatment for victims of the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear power plant disaster. And last year, he stunned the art world by announcing plans to build a museum for his $ 250 million art collection rather than donate it to the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Museum of Art. <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> has spent $ 255,000 so far for the book, much of it for research and traveling expenses for writer <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON>, who helped pen `` Hammer.'' The company expects to spend another $ 120,000 to finish the sequel, the proxy statement said. Lest any investor worry about misspent funds, the cost of the sequel represents a sound investment; `` Hammer'' so far has turned into a literary gusher, earning more than $ 600,000 in royalties for <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Settlement Announced In United Airline Mileage Club Lawsuit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Under an agreement settling a class-action lawsuit, participants in <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' frequent flier program can regain credits lost when rules of the plan were changed for part of 1987, a lawyer says. `` It's a deceptive business practice when customers have followed the rules and accrued the necessary mileage, but can not collect the awards promised that originally led them to join and participate in the program in the first place,'' said the plaintiffs' <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> attorney, <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>. Under such programs, accumulated miles flown can be cashed in for free flights or service upgrades. The lawsuit filed in March 1987 alleged that <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> was unfair when it increased mileage requirements for some awards in January 1987. Most original rules were reinstated in July of that year. A <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the old rules were restored due to consumer complaints and competitive reasons, not because of the lawsuit. In mailings last week, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> provided applications for those who believe they may be entitled to more program credits. Under the 1987 changes, for example, mileage required to earn one free first-class ticket to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> was raised to 60,000 from 50,000. The settlement to the <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> case was reached in December 1988, said <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Dornacker </PERSON>, who speculated that attorneys may have delayed the announcement because of similar lawsuits against two other carriers, American and <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. The 1987 United changes applied to new members, as well as to qualified members who had already accumulated the necessary mileage for such awards under the old program. Lawyers estimate that only a small portion of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s 5 million Mileage Plus program members would be eligible for extra credit. `` The resolution depends on each individual case,'' Ms. <PERSON> Dornacker </PERSON> said. `` No direct compensation is being made to the flyers in cash.'' Attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. Freed said lawsuits against <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> are still in <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Freed contends that changes in the frequent flyers programs by American and <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> constitute a breach of contract and a violation of the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> law. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said American has set up limits on the number of people who can claim free trips on some flights, while <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> has designed such capacity restrictions, but has n't instituted them. Spokeswomen for <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> and American said they could n't comment on pending litigation.

 Officials meeting at the 21st annual <ORGANIZATION> Offshore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> said oil companies can do little to end the price fluctuations that have crippled the industry, but can influence their own costs of doing business. `` Energy industry executives must remember that oil is a commodity subject to the same pressures as other commodities,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Theobold </PERSON>, chairman of Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, a major industry lender. `` As a lender to your industry, we can only predict volatility.'' <PERSON> Theobold </PERSON>, representing the financial sector Monday on a panel kicking off the week-long conference, said oil companies must build in more economic flexibility. `` I know it is n't a lot of fun but we might as well admit it's happening,'' he said Joining him on the keynote panel were <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurance </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lista </PERSON>, vice minister of energy and mines for <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosbie </PERSON>, Canadian minister for international trade. The conference is primarily a technical gathering of some 25,000 engineers and executives involved in offshore oil and gas exploration and production. More than 15,000 people attended Monday. <PERSON> Lista </PERSON>, the panel's representative of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries by virtue of his country's membership in the cartel, said <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> countries are concerned about the recent sharp increases in the price of oil. He complained that the energy consuming countries too often view <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members as `` wearing black hats,'' noting that the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> charter allowed members to receive a fair return on their oil. `` Maybe we can wear the white hats, too,'' he said. `` None of the happenings that have caused this -LRB- jump in oil prices -RRB- is under the control of <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>. `` There's nothing we can do about the spill,'' he said, referring to the recent oil spill in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. `` There's nothing we can do about the excessive use of gasoline in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` If the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> countries are allowed by the rest of the world, <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> will keep the rest of the world supplied with oil. We want the consuming countries to benefit as much as producing countries from the resource nature has given us.'' Although <PERSON> Lista </PERSON> said he thought <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> would keep prices at a level `` where everyone will be happy,'' <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said there are indications several members of the cartel will push for higher production quotas when the current $ 18 per-barrel price agreement expires later this summer. `` The underlying facts of the world supply and demand argue against a strong price recovery,'' he said. `` In general, the industry outlook is restrained.'' <PERSON> Crosbie </PERSON> said he hoped <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> would be viewed as an attractive place for investment and that the country's oil and gas industry showed great promise, but he downplayed the significance of energy price forecasts. He noted that when forecasts in the early 1980s pointed to $ 65-per-barrel oil, he and his party backed a 30-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax that Canadian voters found abhorrent. The unpopular stance was reflected in the party's lack of success in the next election, <PERSON> Crosbie </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> sees the possibility that the domestic oil rig count, 751 as of Monday, could double within five years. `` While an improvement, this increase is not enough to reverse domestic production decline,'' he said. While oil companies can not control prices, <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said, they can address their own costs.

 More than 100 days into his presidency, it's time for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to make good on his promise to renew five-year quotas on steel imports, says the outgoing chairman of the nation's largest <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> said Monday steelmakers count 225 sponsors in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and 56 in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> _ a majority in both houses _ for legislation authorizing the president to renew the quotas, called Voluntary Restraint Agreements `` This ... should encourage the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to publicly announce its plan to extend the VRAs,'' he told shareholders at their annual meeting. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said late in the 1988 presidential campaign that he would renew the program, but has not said how long the quotas might continue or what products and countries might be covered. `` We have n't heard from his lips,'' <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> said. The quotas are scheduled to expire Sept. 30. The three-month delay between orders and shipments could make the domestic market uncertain and vulnerable to foreign predators, he said. `` If we do n't have a clear definition of the VRAs and a clear definition of when they're going to be extended, you're going to find a lot of people in here trying to dump steel,'' he said at a news conference before the meeting. Dumping is selling at illegally low prices, such as below the cost of production. <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> nearly has finished preparing trade suits against steelmakers in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and most other major steel exporting nations. The suits will be filed if there is any gap in the quota program. <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> said 65 percent of its customers support renewal, 25 percent to 30 percent were indifferent and only 5 percent oppose it. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration should release terms of the renewal by May, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should act by June, and negotiations with nations on their individual quotas should begin by July 1, he said. `` Their extension for a five-year period is essential to the continuing turnaround of American steelmaking,'' <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> said. `` Failure to extend them would cast a cloud over our steel unit's prosperity. The quotas were intended to limit foreign steel to around 20 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market, protecting hard-pressed American producers from losing customers to predatory pricing by government-subsidized producers overseas. The quotas fell short of the goal in the first few years but are now on target. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> announced plans to spend $ 240 million to further modernize its largest plant, at <LOCATION> Gary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>. The keystone of the improvements will be a continuous slab caster designed to shape 1.6 million tons of molten steel directly into slabs, using less energy and less time and leaving fewer blemishes in the steel. The new caster, planned to begin operating in mid-1991, will eliminate 400 to 500 of the 7,500 jobs at the Gary Works, <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> said. Attrition will ease the effect of the cuts.

It's like, ` OK, we'll waltz with it again,''' <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said A few blocks away, at <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s News, most employees oppose a <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION>, said reporter <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Mleczko </PERSON>, also president of Local 22 of The Newspaper Guild of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> `` The mood today was just ebullient _ cheering and applause in the newsroom,'' <PERSON> Mleczko </PERSON> said. He also said the union will press for new contracts talks. Amid uncertainty over the <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION>, more than 3,000 union employees at News and Free Press have been without contract wage increases since 1986. The newspapers have sought since May 1986 to cut costs by merging business, advertising and production departments while maintaining separate news and editorial staffs. They would split profits and losses equally for most of the 100-year agreement. The papers said the Free Press was in danger of failing. <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> said it would spend as much as needed to force the 157 year-old Free Press out of business. <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> said without the agreement, it would close the Free Press. Then-Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> approved the agreement in August 1988, but challenges by the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Citizens for an <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and the Washington-based advocacy group <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION> delayed implementation. No stay is in effect, and the newspapers would have the option of merging while awaiting the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s decision. <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION>'s president and chief executive officer, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Batten </PERSON>, said the organization continues `` to believe strongly in the fairness and justice of our case on behalf of a <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'' and will decide in coming days what to do next. `` Clearly, from their point of view, they would like to eliminate the cash drain of the Free Press,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reidy </PERSON>, communications industry analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` On the other hand, if they wait it out, then they'll have half interest in a <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION>, which will earn considerably more for them than the loss last year. So it is a tough decision.'' `` There are some second thoughts,'' said <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallaugher </PERSON>, who manages 2.1 million shares of <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> stock owned by the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're going to take a hard look at our investment in <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION>.'' The Free Press lost $ 18.5 million in 1988, <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> said in recent court filings. <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> has released no annual loss figures but has said the 115 year-old News lost $ 64.95 million from 1980 through 1987. `` It would be my hope that we would stay the course,'' Free Press Managing Editor <PERSON> Heath </PERSON> <PERSON> Meriwether </PERSON> said. He acknowledged employees are discouraged. <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION>, through spokeswoman <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, said it was reviewing the decision and would not comment. The <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Citizens' group argued that the newspapers' losses resulted from struggles to force each other out of business rather than conditions inherent in the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> market. `` We think that the tendency of these types of monopolistic arrangements is negative,'' said State Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, a leader of the group. The Newspaper Guild first opposed the agreement, though it dropped opposition in 1988 when <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> said a <ORGANIZATION> JOA </ORGANIZATION> would mean closing the Free Press. The newspapers say closing the Free Press would cost 2,200 jobs while a joint operating agreement would mean a total of 600 to 800 jobs lost at the two papers. <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, is the nation's largest newspaper publishing group. <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION>, headquartered in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, is the second largest.

<HEAD>Board Of Trade Commissions Study Of Dual Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The controversial practice of dual trading on the futures market will be assessed by an outside specialist, the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> announced. The exchange said Monday that it has hired economist <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> to study the practice in conjunction with the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>'s own review of trading practices. The announcement comes three months after disclosure of a federal investigation into suspected fraud that is said to involve dual trading at the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Dual trading allows traders to buy or sell futures contracts for themselves and customers at the same time. Dual trading is n't illegal but critics call it a conflict of interest and say it encourages fraud by unscrupulous traders who trade their own accounts first, profiting at the expense of their customers `` The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> has dedicated itself to evaluating all aspects of trading practices and market surveillance,'' said <PERSON> Karsten </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahlmann </PERSON>, chairman of the exchange. `` Commissioning this study is another step in this process.'' Meanwhile, at a meeting Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> officials told more than 200 exchange members that they have no choice but to reform trading practices or else invite government intervention. `` In order to achieve the right to continued self-regulation, we must act responsibly,'' said <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Melamed </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>'s executive committee <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> officials leaving the meeting also said they expect a referendum will be held on the most controversial aspects of the reform package proposed April 19 by a special exchange committee, the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today. Among proposals is a ban on most forms of dual trading. But <PERSON> Melamed </PERSON> said that `` much fine-tuning is required'' on the proposals. <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON>, who will assess dual trading at the <ORGANIZATION> CBOT </ORGANIZATION>, was a contributor to a report on the 1987 stock market crash commissioned by the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The CBOT, at the request of the <ORGANIZATION> Commodities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, had previously conducted a study of dual trading. The study said the practice of dual trading results in a better price for customers and adds to the liquidity of the market. The study also contended that customers can choose to trade with a broker who does not trade for himself.

<HEAD>Pepsi's Profit Soared 46 Percent In First Quarter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Soft drinks giant <ORGANIZATION> PepsiCo </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday reported a 45.7 percent surge in first-quarter income, reflecting strong results in each of the company's three divisions. It marked the eighth straight quarter in which <ORGANIZATION> PepsiCo </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings, excluding one-time gains and charges, have grown by 25 percent or more <ORGANIZATION> PepsiCo </ORGANIZATION> said its profit rose to 165.1 million, or 62 cents a share, in the 12 weeks ended March 25 from $ 113.3 million, or 43 cents a share, in the comparable 1988 period. Excluding a $ 14.5 million pre-tax charge for the reorganization of <ORGANIZATION> PepsiCo </ORGANIZATION>'s domestic soft drink business in 1988's first quarter, the latest quarterly earnings gain came to 33 percent. Sales totaled $ 2.96 billion in the first quarter, up 19.3 percent from $ 2.48 billion a year earlier. Worldwide restaurant sales expanded by 27 percent to $ 1.07 billion from $ 844.5 million. <ORGANIZATION> PepsiCo </ORGANIZATION> owns <ORGANIZATION> Pizza </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Huts </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fried </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicken </ORGANIZATION> outlets and <ORGANIZATION> Taco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> restaurants. Soft drink sales went up by 18 percent to $ 1.05 billion from $ 893 million. Domestic results were buoyant and international profits in the soft drink division doubled. Sales of Diet <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> and Moutain Dew brands were particularly strong while sales of regular <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> were flat. Sales of snack foods rose 12 percent to $ 830.8 million from $ 741.4 million. Robust growth in sales of corn-based items, such as Doritos, Fritos and Cheetos, was partially offset by declines in the volume of potato-based products due to drought-related allocations of potato supplies early in the quarter.

<TEXT>
 Attorneys general of three <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> states want the nation's chief law officer to investigate why oil prices have risen sharply, especially since the March 24 <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> oil spill in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Frohnmayer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Eikenberry </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> said in a news release Monday they will ask <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, for a federal investigation of gasoline prices. The three also scheduled a news conference this afternoon in <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> to announce a joint action of their own `` in pursuit of an explanation of the sudden and extreme increase in oil prices since the grounding of the Exxon Valdez,'' according to a statement from <PERSON> Eikenberry </PERSON>'s office. The group also planned to ask executives of major oil companies to meet with them to explain the price increases. The oil industry blames the sharp rise in crude oil prices, which have increased more than $ 7 a barrel since January, for most of the higher prices at the gas pumps. Concerns over tight gasoline supplies for the summer driving season escalated following the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil spill and an explosion at a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> oil rig. More than 10 million gallons of crude oil spilled into <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> when the Exxon tanker struck a reef March 24 Since then, gasoline prices have increased an average 10 percent nationally, while the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> experienced price surges as high as 25 percent in less than a month, said <PERSON> Marla </PERSON> <PERSON> Rae </PERSON>, executive assistant to <PERSON> Frohnmayer </PERSON>. But the oil industry says that crude oil prices surged since last November while gasoline prices did not experience a comparable rise. The joint action was necessary because of the high costs of pursuing such investigations, Ms. <PERSON> Rae </PERSON> said, noting that some state agencies are still involved in anti-trust litigation stemming from gasoline shortages in the early'70s. She characterized the proposed action as `` a consumer-related matter,'' rather than a possible anti-trust investigation. <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> <PERSON> Kondo </PERSON>, an assistant attorney general in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, said the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state investigation was sparked by consumer complaints and requests from members of the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and King County Executive <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>. The petroleum price increases have hit the region's agriculture and tourism industries hard, Ms. <PERSON> Rae </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> <PERSON> Watts </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, said self-serve regular gasoline prices in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, in 10 areas surveyed, rose 9.3 cents between March 14 and April 5-6. `` That's a definite increase,'' she said. `` Prices were steadily going down over the last year, but we got our first increase _ an average 2.2 cents _ between Christmas and Easter.'' Higher prices will surely be reflected in another survey for the Memorial Day weekend, planned for the week of May 7-14, she said.

<HEAD>Corporate Raider Says Trade Barriers May Be Needed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>AUSTIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Takeover strategist <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> says he has been preaching free enterprise for years, but now that he is involved in a dispute with a Japanese company, he thinks trade barriers may be needed. `` Something now has to be done, and if necessary I think you ought to put up some barriers temporarily until we get a level playing field,'' <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> said Monday. <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oilman known worldwide for his corporate raids, has purchased 20.2 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to become the largest stockholder of the Japanese automobile parts manufacturer. He has been rebuffed by <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> in trying to seat his representatives on the board, he said. <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> said he spoke recently with Secretary of Commerce <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> and about a dozen members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> concerning his Japanese business venture. `` I found a very sympathetic ear to what I was saying,'' <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> said of his meetings with key trade legislators in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` At the same time I told them I'm not asking for any help. I just think that here in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, we have been way too lax and too easy on letting the Japanese come,'' into <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> markets, he said. <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> said he told <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION> representatives that he wants to be a long-term stockholder and his stock purchase is not part of a hostile takeover attempt. `` Still the attitude is one that we do n't want you in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. And this is what kind of got my back up in the whole affair. I just said to hell with this. It's got to be different than this,'' he said. <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>, who is considering a bid for the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> gubernatorial nomination, said he has always supported foreign companies investing in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but that his experience with <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION> convinced him more needs to be done to open foreign markets to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses. But <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> said he is not seeking any federal help in his struggle with <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION>. `` I've drilled dry holes before, and this may be one of them,'' he said. <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>, a general partner of <ORGANIZATION> Mesa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Limited </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partnership </ORGANIZATION>, an oil and gas company, was in the state Capitol Monday to testify against proposed legislation aimed at making it more difficult for hostile takeovers.

<HEAD>City Lets $600,000 Sit In Bank That Later Hired Mayor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A bank held $ 600,000 in federal funds for the city without paying interest for three months in an account established by Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> and controlled by one of his aides, a newspaper reported today. Two months after the situation was discovered, <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> started earning $ 18,000 a year as a consultant to the bank, the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>'s ties to <ORGANIZATION> Far </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and another institution, <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, have prompted an investigation by the city attorney's office and Police Department into conflict-of-interest allegations and spawned the formation of a city ethics panel. The panel of seven civic and religious leaders, appointed by <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> one day after his narrow re-election April 11, met for the first time Monday and sought to distance itself from the mayor and the City Council. The panel agreed to organize as an independent organization, probably as a nonprofit corporation, and not take any funds from <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, his political action committee or the City Council. `` We will be most effective, most credible ... if we are independent,'' said <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON>, former state chairman of the political watchdog group <ORGANIZATION> Common </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cause </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON> was asked by <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> to head the panel. According to records obtained by the <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> authorized the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bank account and his top aide, <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Calleia </PERSON>, controlled deposits made to the account by the federal government in 1987. On Aug. 4, 1987, $ 600,000 in federal transportation funds were deposited in the account, and on Oct. 31, 1987, $ 789,230 was added, records show. It was not until Nov. 9, 1987 that the city treasurer's office discovered <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> held nearly $ 1.4 million in city funds and ordered the bank to return the money to the city, the <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION> reported. The money should have been transferred to the city treasury within a day or two, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, the city treasurer's cash management and investment officer. A spokesman for the federal <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, which sent the money to the city, said the deposit may have violated federal regulations because money from federal grants must be spent promptly. The spokesman asked not to be identified. Phone calls to <PERSON> Calleia </PERSON>'s office for comment were not returned. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> has refused to comment on his ties to the financial institutions pending the outcome of the city attorney's investigation The mayor has denied knowing the city was doing business with the bank in 1988 at a time Far East was paying him $ 18,000 a year to act as a consultant. The mayor returned the $ 18,000 after the matter was made public.

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> today expanded the board that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants to oversee the cleanup of the savings and loan crisis to include Housing and Urban Development Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> and a private real estate specialist. After earlier enacting much tougher capital standards than <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> originally wanted to impose on the thrift industry, the 51-member committee today provided for more administration oversight of the $ 100 billion bailout. The effort _ which will involve the largest disposition of government-owned property since the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Purchase </LOCATION> _ will be overseen by a new agency called the <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` Even with the best of intentions, we'll still end up with about 1,000 new <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trumps </PERSON>,'' said committee Chairman <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, referring to the billionaire <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> developer. `` This has been an issue that has raised its head every time in a bailout.'' <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s acquisition of real estate through the government bailout of the <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> in the early 1970s sparked his financial rise. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had wanted a three-member board headed by <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> and including Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> to run the <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> expanded the board to include two more voting members, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> and a real estate expert to be selected; plus one non-voting member, <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, who will be in charge of the day-to-day task of administering the cleanup. Lawmakers said their chief aim is providing more administrative oversight and expertise in an effort to thwart abuses that have characterized other bailouts. Putting <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> on the board will help, they said. For example, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asset </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disposition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, created by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> to dispose of property that fell into government hands from S & amp; L failures in the early 1980s has been plagued with accusations of inside dealing and political croynyism. `` There was a lot of talk about fraud, abuse and criminal activity'' in the S & amp; L industry, said Rep. <PERSON> Chalmers </PERSON> <PERSON> Wylie </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, the ranking Republican on the Banking Committee. `` The attorney general might be useful in finding some of that property that was disposed of in ways that were not all that kosher.'' After last week toughening <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposed capital standards, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel on Monday beat bac -LCB- rw'' exemptions from capital requirements that have allowed many S & amp; L owners to operate with little or no money of their own at risk. Assistant Treasury Secretary <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullins </PERSON> called Monday's action `` another good day'' for the administration, praising Democrats on the panel for helping defeat `` accounting devices'' offered primarily by young <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers `` to water down'' what <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants However, the fight is not over. Rep. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., who as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has controlling influence over what issues are revisited when a bill reaches the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor, last week said in a letter he strongly supports continuation of the `` good will'' exemptions According to industry and government records, at least 14 S & amp; Ls in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> with assets totaling $ 26 billion have little or no capital other than `` good will.'' And half of them have a negative net worth when `` good will'' is excluded from their balance sheets. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> spent more than two hours Monday lobbying lawmakers on the 51-member committee for amendments he wants to make S & amp; Ls and banks devote more of their lending to mortgages for low-income families and inner city redevelopment.

 <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said today its first-quarter earnings rose 91 percent over the same period last year, when the corporation's profits were dented by the closing of some parts plants. The No. 3 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automaker said it earned $ 351 million, or $ 1.50 a share, during the first three months of this year, compared with $ 184 million, or 83 cents per share, in the same period last year. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s profits came on first-quarter 1989 revenues of $ 9.95 billion, up 16.3 percent from its first-quarter revenues last year. The year-ago results included a $ 93 million, or 42-cents-a-share, one-time charge the company incurred from closing some <ORGANIZATION> Acustar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> parts subsidiary's plants. Without the closings, first-quarter earnings last year came to $ 277 million, or $ 1.25 a share, 26.7 percent less than first-quarter profits this year. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> said the company's share of the car market dipped during the first quarter. But it maintained a strong presence in the light truck market, especially in the minivan segment, where <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> makes about half of such vehicles sold in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Last month, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported its first-quarter earnings rose 42.2 percent, to $ 1.55 billion, or $ 2.37 per share, over last year. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said that in the first quarter this year, it earned $ 1.64 billion, or $ 3.44 a share, up 0.9 percent from a year ago. The combined Big Three earnings made for the best first quarter in the companies' history as they earned $ 3.54 billion, topping by $ 324 million the first-quarter record set in 1984. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>, whose earnings have been hit hard in the past by incentive costs, was the last of the Big Three to jump into the latest incentive pool, offering free financing on two-year loans for all of its cars and some trucks. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> offer interest as low as 2.9 percent. Much of the cost of those incentives will show up on the Big Three's second-quarter balance sheets. <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> said the company benefited from sales of the <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spirit </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acclaim </ORGANIZATION>, which replaced its compact K-series cars, and in the more-expensive models. Also during the quarter, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> began two shifts of production at its <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, plant, which makes the Spirit-Acclaim line. Meantime, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the automaker's financing arm, said it earned $ 65 million during the first quarter, the same as the first three months of last year. The subsidiary's automotive lending operations, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION>, reported the number of new and used vehicles it financed rose 11.4 percent during the first quarter from the same period last year.

<TEXT>
 The parent of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> is nearing an announcement that it is ordering up to 100 commuter aircraft to equip its regional airlines, a newspaper reported today. The Dallas Morning News quoted unnamed industry sources as saying they believe <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth-based </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> is leaning toward <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Saab </ORGANIZATION> for the order although the airline is still evaluating different aircraft types. An announcement of firm orders for 50 aircraft and options for 50 more is expected within a few weeks, the sources told the newspaper. American's parent, <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, would use the planes to outfit regional airlines operated by its <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> commuter subsidiary. Sources said the order has a potential value of $ 700 million to $ 1 billion, depending on the aircraft models ordered. American officials reportedly are also considering turboprop aircraft produced by <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s Canada-DeHavilland Division, based near <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> ATR </ORGANIZATION>, a joint French-Italian company; and <ORGANIZATION> Saab </ORGANIZATION>. But the News' sources said <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> favors <ORGANIZATION> Saab </ORGANIZATION> because of price and partly because the Swedish manufacturer would have delivery positions available earlier than the other two candidates. The new aircraft would be used both to replace older planes at <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION>'s commuter subsidiaries and to enlarge their fleets, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Martens </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagle </ORGANIZATION>. American, since 1987, has acquired five of the commuter airlines it formerly had marketing arrangements with. The carriers feed traffic into American's hubs such as Dallas-Fort Worth.

 The <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> today endorsed plans for a nationwide labor boycott of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> if its unions strike later this month, a strategy that could put labor in the unusual position of funneling millions of dollars to a non-union company. The federation's governing council approved the plan at its spring meeting, acknowledging <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's competitors were non-union but promising nonetheless to switch long-distance carriers if asked to do so by the <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> will be prepared to mobilize its resources to assist union workers at <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T and to call for the fullest support possible from affiliated unions, state federations and local labor councils,'' the council said in its resolution. In an accompanying statement the council said, `` Despite the fact that most of <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's competitors are non-union, the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> believes picket lines _ whether visible or invisible _ are a crucial form of communication to inform union members and other consumers about unfair actions taken by an employer.'' Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> IBEW </ORGANIZATION> said that in the event of a strike and boycott they would urge labor organizations and union members who use <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T to instead use non-union <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` One of the opportunities we have is the power to severely impact the enormous revenues generated by electronic services of the telecommunications industry,'' <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Bahr </PERSON> said Monday in touching on the proposal during a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> convention in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Labor officials familiar with the plan said that if <PERSON> Bahr </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> IBEW </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> decided to launch a boycott the 14 million-member <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> would urge its affiliate unions and their members to switch to <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> by using that company's local access numbers. That process would allow members to use Sprint without having to switch long-distance carriers permanently. <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> officials said most if not all of its member unions use <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T for long-distance service, with some of the larger unions paying the company about $ 1 million a month. `` It's hundreds of millions of dollars a year,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON>, who said she could not immediately provide a more specific estimate. She acknowledged that a non-union company would benefit from such a boycott but said, `` We are prepared to do this if we have to win jobs with justice at <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T. ... We do n't want to promote Sprint. What we are promoting is the fact that unions can do this, that thi is one tool we can use at the bargaining table to achieve a fair contract.'' An <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said the company considered the proposal `` self-defeating'' because it would help <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's competitors and therefore possibly cost union members their jobs. The presentation to the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> executive council comes at a time when the unions are grumbling about <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's negotiating positions, primarily a company proposal to shift more health-care costs to workers. The talks are in recess and due to resume Monday, three weeks before expiration of current contracts. It is the first time the two unions have negotiated jointly with <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> T. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> struck the company in 1986 but <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> was able to keep half of its manufacturing plants open because <ORGANIZATION> IBEW </ORGANIZATION> workers continued to work.

 <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> took great pains to avoid competition with well-established <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> chairman testified today as a court tried to determine how much <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> should pay for infringing on its rival's instant-photography technology. Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCune </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the opening witness of the trial, began outlining the corporate history of his company, beginning with founder <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Land </PERSON>'s quest for instant photography in the 1940s after his daughter asked why she could immediately see a picture her father had taken. <PERSON> McCune </PERSON> said throughout its history <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> had tried to avoid direct competition with <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>, the leader in the photography field. He said <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> could have taken the `` bread and butter'' from the Polaroid plate and the firm took pains to avoid a marketing competition. In opening arguments Monday before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazzone </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> argued that the $ 12 billion that <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> is seeking in its patent infringement lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> is greater than all of <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s profits from 1947 to 1987. The <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> lawyers sought to portray <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> as a corporate opportunist looking for a windfall from the 13-year-old lawsuit. <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s lawyers, on the other hand, pointed to a <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> internal memo as evidence that the <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, N.Y.-based company knowingly violated seven of <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s patents when it began selling instant cameras in 1976. They said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fallon </PERSON>, who was then <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive, personally reviewed the memo and jotted the words `` big block'' in the margin next to a paragraph about <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s patents <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>'s lead counsel, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON>, did not discuss the memo in his opening statement. But he argued that <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>'s foray into instant cameras and film was based on advice from a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> law firm, <ORGANIZATION> Kenyon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON>, that turned out to be faulty. If <PERSON> Mazzone </PERSON> awards Polaroid anything close to $ 12 billion, it will be the largest patent infringement decision in history, far surpassing the record $ 207 million that <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> was ordered to pay <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> three years ago for copying drill bit technology. Whether <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> violated <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s patents is no longer in question. A judge ruled in 1985 that <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> had done so, and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> let that ruling stand Monday. The only issue in the current trial is how much <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>'s violations hurt <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> and whether they were deliberate, which would open the way to punitive damages <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> argued in its pre-trial briefs that the most it should have to pay Cambridge-based Polaroid is $ 177 million, or 5 percent royalties on the instant cameras and film <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> sold from 1976 until 1985. Polaroid bases its huge damage claim on the grounds that <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> deprived it of billions of dollars in sales and started a price war that forced it to sell some cameras below cost. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> contends that <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> caused long-term damaged to the market by portraying instant cameras as cheap toys rather than serious equipment. <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> contends, however, that its entry into the market actually benefited <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>, because the millions of dollars it spent on advertising and promotion increased demand for both brands of instant cameras. The case was been divided into two portions, the first dealing with whether <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> violated <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s patents, and the second with financial compensation. The first portion went to trial in 1981 and resulted in an October 1985 ruling by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Rya </PERSON> <PERSON> Zobel </PERSON> that <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> had infringed some of <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s most essential patents. On her orders, <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> quit the instant photography business in January 1986 after losing more than $ 600 million. <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> appealed Mrs. <PERSON> Zobel </PERSON>'s decision, arguing that she had a conflict of interest because her mother-in-law owned 1,000 shares of <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> stock. But a federal appeals court affirmed the ruling, noting that Mrs. <PERSON> Zobel </PERSON> had told both companies in 1981 that her mother-in-law owned the shares, and neither company had objected. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> announced Monday it would not review the appeals court's ruling, which means Mrs. <PERSON> Zobel </PERSON>'s decision is the final word.

 Government and the automotive industry must intensify efforts to find new ways of fueling the nation's vehicles if an oil crisis is to be averted in the 1990s, Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON> IV said Tuesday. `` We need to think systematically about what must be done by the end of the next decade to displace millions of barrels a day of imported oil with alternative fuels,'' the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Democrat told the <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automotive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is time for us to get on with the job of making the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> energy secure again.'' <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON>'s remarks came at the opening of the society's three-day conference on technical and regulatory issues facing the automotive industry, including fuel economy, safety and alternative fuels The major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automakers have built prototypes of cars using alcohol-based fuels. However, efforts to promote such vehicles as commercial products have been constrained by relatively cheap oil prices during much of the 1980s and the lack of a national distribution network for fuels other than gasoline. `` The assumption that we can become dependent on imported oil because it is now cheap will become a very expensive assumption in the long run. It does not take much imagination to envision an energy crisis in the 1990s,'' <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON> said the government must avoid a narrow focus in making automotive policy. `` We can not assume that all the world's problems can be solved just by regulating ... the automobile,'' <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> energy subcommittee on research and development would hold hearings in June aimed at finding ways to encourage the replacement of gasoline with alternative fuels, such as methanol, ethanol and natural gas.

 Americans need to make wrenching changes to succeed in the global economy even though there is no crisis pushing them to take immediate action, an MIT panel said Tuesday. Taking only small or partial steps to improve the nation's competitiveness will doom the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to steady slippage in the standard of living, according to the two-year study by scientists, engineers and economists from <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> `` We are indeed in serious trouble with respect to our industrial performance,'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dertouzos </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productivity </ORGANIZATION>, told a news conference Unless something is done, he said, `` The nation will become progressively more impoverished in relative terms.'' The authors of the study, `` Made In <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' were scheduled to testify on their findings Wednesday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>, headed by Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass. Restoring <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> competitiveness demands grass-roots changes by companies, unions, schools and workers, the study said. While government has a role to play, changes that come from the bottom up are essential to improving the nation's lagging rate of productivity growth, it said. `` To live well, a nation must produce well,'' says the lead sentence in the study, released as a 344-page hardcover book. Among the three principal authors is <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Solow </PERSON>, who won the 1987 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science and is vice chairman of <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Industrial Productivity. The others are <PERSON> Dertouzos </PERSON>, a professor of electrical engineering and computer science, and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lester </PERSON>, executive director of the commission and an associate professor of nuclear engineering. The study says that if the right steps are taken, `` this nation has every chance of entering the 21st century displaying the same dynamism that characterized its industrial performance throughout much of the present century.'' The <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> study differs from many others in that it does not focus on such economic issues as the high cost of capital in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the shortage of national savings. Instead, it focuses on what it calls an excessive concern with short-term profits; outdated corporate strategies that focus too much on mass production and the domestic American market; and lack of cooperation within and among <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies. It also puts the blame on neglect of people, technological failures in translating discoveries into products and unwise public policies. Companies that are doing well today often are ones that have started from scratch or come through crises, the authors said. They cited <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which fought back after losing most of the world copier market in the 1970s and early 1980s, and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which has rebounded to become the nation's most profitable automaker after losing $ 3.3 billion from 1980 through 1982. `` The management trick is, can you change before you have a crisis?'' said <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurow </PERSON>, deal of <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Sloan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>. It can be done, he said. `` There is n't something magical here that the rest of the world's got that we have n't got,'' <PERSON> Thurow </PERSON> said. For industry, the study's main recommendation is to focus on steady, continuous improvements in the production process. To hurry things along, companies should begin working on designing products and the processes for making them before the research and development is even complete, the study says. Suppliers should be treated as allies rather than adversaries, the study says. Because the economy is becoming global, American managers should know more about foreign cultures and ways of doing business, it says. Labor representatives should be accepted as `` legitimate and valued partners in the innovation process,'' the report states. But it also says traditional labor-union stands on work rules, job security and compensation need to be reconsidered. For government, it recommends taking steps to raise private savings and cut the federal budget deficit; opening foreign markets; making labor laws more flexible; supporting research and development; and making military spending more efficient. It also recommends laws to restrict borrowing for corporate takeovers and buyouts. On education, it says government should get schools to promote `` technological literacy'' and encourage companies to do more on-the-job education and training. The study acknowledges that many companies are too small to do extensive education and training, while others are afraid that employees will quit and take their newly acquired skills elsewhere.

 Better on-the-job training, even more than better schools, holds the key to helping <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> workers catch up to the Japanese and others in productivity, concluded an <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> report released Tuesday. `` Young Americans receive most of their job skills in institutions of formal learning, and what they pick up on the job is usually of a limited nature, gathered from watching a colleague,'' said the report, `` Made in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' Japanese and West German corporations invest far more than most <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> firms in training and retraining workers over a lifetime. The payoff, said the study, is a workforce prepared and flexible enough to adapt to changing styles and technologies. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> firms such as <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chaparral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> do provide effective training, the report said. But many small and medium-sized companies feel they ca n't afford to establish extensive training programs. Or they are concerned that if they do, they'd lose their investment when workers transfer to other companies. Changing this `` would require a kind of national political leadership that has not yet appeared,'' the report said. The two-year study was produced by a 16-member <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Industrial Productivity. The 344-page report's principal authors were <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dertouzos </PERSON>, professor of engineering and computer science, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lester </PERSON>, associate professor of nuclear engineering, and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Solow </PERSON>, professor of economics and Nobel laureate in economics. Neglect of human resources may be the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' biggest failing, <PERSON> Dertouzos </PERSON> said at a news conference on the report. While critical of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> public schools and vocational schools for turning out children ill-equipped in math, science and other disciplines, the report said school reform is only a first step toward a more productive workforce. `` Even if American schools were to be improved, there are reasons to believe that learning work skills on the job might be preferable to learning them in schools,'' the report argued. Skills developed on the job tend to be broader, more flexible and more relevant to the future needs of the corporation. Such skills are general enough so that they can be useful even if the worker switches jobs. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, for example, offers young workers apprenticeships in 400 occupations. The apprentice, usually 16 years old, spends an average of three years working in a firm under a supervisor. The training curriculum is negotiated with government, employers' associations and trade unions In <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, workers rotate between research, manufacturing, sales and other areas. They spend several days a year in corporate training centers and are also encouraged to take correspondence courses. The report disputed the notion that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> workers are being outdone by foreign competitors because of a decline in the work ethic. `` The issue is not what workers will do when motivated but rather what they can do, given their weaker basic education and the kind of work experiences provided by companies that have low regard for training and few institutional resources to provide it,'' it said.

 Share prices closed lower on the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> stock exchange Tuesday as renewed inflationary fears and light buying interest after a long holiday weekend combined to undo some of the gains the market made last week. The trading session was one of the quietest since early January, with volume amounting to 333.9 million shares. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 index closed 14.9 points, or 0.7 percent, lower at 2,103.2, the day's lowest level but just above the psychologically important 2,100 point barrier. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> 30-share index closed at 1,736.3, down 14.1. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> 500-share index finished at 1,195.76, down 7.42. Dealers said the market was upset by renewed fears of an upward drift in world interest rates, with much of the concern stemming from Monday's release of a survey of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> purchasing managers which pointed to still-buoyant growth in April. Those fears had receded last week, pushing the <ORGANIZATION> FT-SE </ORGANIZATION> 100 over 50 points higher during the five days. As well as international pressures, the British government may also be forced to raise interest rates again for domestic reasons, dealers said, especiallly if the pound comes under renewed downward pressure.

 The head of P.A. <ORGANIZATION> Bergner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday he is inclined to keep the department store company's headquarters in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> after acquiring Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Carson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pirie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bergner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> announced the $ 453 million merger Monday, which would create one of the Midwest's largest retail chains `` We have always had ambitions of being a major player in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> market,'' <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of <PERSON> Bergner </PERSON>, said at a news conference Tuesday. The combined companies will control more than 60 stores in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, and they will have a single headquarters, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. `` We are inclined to leave the headquarters in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` However, before we make a final decision, we will see if there are significant business reasons for changing our position.'' <PERSON> Bergner </PERSON> moved its headquarters from <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> when the company bought the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Store </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> chain </ORGANIZATION>, which operates in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said officials made that decision because they felt they needed to be more attuned to the <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> market. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bergner </PERSON> already operates stores in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area, and `` we know the market there.'' Officials said the merger would have little effect on the individual stores, which will retain their names. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> described the merger with <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> as an `` outstanding fit,'' because the two retail companies cater to similar customers and because their markets are adjacent to each other. `` This is n't like buying a chain spread out across the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Landschulz </PERSON>, a retail analyst with the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> brokerage firm of <ORGANIZATION> Cowen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The two chains overlap only in one shopping center, at Randhurst outside <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said no immediate decision has been made on whether to close one of the stores. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said, however, <PERSON> Bergner </PERSON> will sell off <PERSON> Carson </PERSON>'s specialty store operations, which include 391 County Seat casual wear stores and 23 <LOCATION> Arcadia </LOCATION> novelty shops. `` We are a department store operator,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. `` That's the business we know. <PERSON> Bergner </PERSON>, owned by the Maus and <PERSON> Nordmann </PERSON> families of <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, had sales of $ 470 million last year. <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> had sales of $ 1.02 billion in 1988. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> estimated the merger would bring about $ 300 million in debt to <PERSON> Bergner </PERSON>, but part of that money would be paid off through the sale of the specialty stores.

<HEAD>Chrysler Up; Big Three Set 1st-Quarter Earnings Record</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s first-quarter earnings rose 91 percent from last year's depressed level, pushing profits for the Big Three to a quarterly record, according to figures released Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> said it earned $ 351 million, or $ 1.50 a share, during the first three months of the year, compared with $ 183.7 million, or 83 cents a share, during the same time last year. Revenue rose 16 percent to $ 9.95 billion from $ 8.56 billion. The earnings benefited by comparison with last year, when the No. 3 automaker closed a number of its <ORGANIZATION> Acustar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> parts subsidiary plants Those closings cut profits by $ 93 million, or 42 cents a share. Without the reduction last year, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s first-quarter profits would have been 26.7 percent higher. The company's profits came on revenues of $ 9.95 billion this year, up 16.3 percent from its first-quarter revenues last year. Late last month, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported it made $ 1.55 billion and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said it earned $ 1.64 billion, bringing the Big Three profits during the quarter to $ 3.54 billion. That's the best first quarter on record, topping the first period of 1984, when the companies made $ 3.22 billion Analyst <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillippi </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said some of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s increase came because of lower incentive costs during the period this year. In the past, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> has used incentives liberally to entice buyers. In very late March and early April, each of the Big Three introduced new incentive packages, with cash rebates and low _ or in <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s case no _ financing charges on some loans. Much of the cost of the new incentive packages, which have given a boost to car and truck sales, will be charged against second-quarter profits. `` They're talking -LRB- a cost of -RRB- $ 800 per car versus $ 600 in the first quarter,'' <PERSON> Phillippi </PERSON> said Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s incentive package runs indefinitely, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s expires May 31 and <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s runs out June 5. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> said the company benefited from sales of the <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spirit </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acclaim </ORGANIZATION>, which replaced its K-series compact cars, and in its more-expensive models. Also during the quarter, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> began two shifts of production at its <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, plant, which makes the Spirit-Acclaim line. <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> also said <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> is holding its share of the sport-utility market, through its Jeep line, and in the minivan segment, where the company commands better than 50 percent of the sales. `` Jeeps and minivans, that's the money pump,'' <PERSON> Phillippi </PERSON> said. Meantime, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the automaker's financing arm, said it earned $ 65 million during the first quarter, the same as the first three months of last year. The subsidiary's automotive lending operations, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION>, reported the number of new and used vehicles it financed rose 11.4 percent during the first quarter from the same period last year.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar rose against most major currencies in slow European trading Tuesday after the May Day holiday on Monday. Gold prices were lower. Foreign-exchange dealers said the dollar was well supported despite the lack of news to influence exchange rates. They said the dollar held steady despite intervention by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Canadian central banks and most European central banks, which sold dollars to drive down the currency's value. There were plenty of buyers around to snap up the offered <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency, the dealers said. Trading was slack because most markets will close again Thursday for Ascension Day. One dealer in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, attributed the dollar's strength to the weakness of the West German mark, the relatively strong performance of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in his first 100 days in office and the steady course of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, one British pound cost $ 1.6845 late Tuesday, unchanged from late Friday. Other late rates for the dollar compared with late rates last Friday: 1.8875 West German marks, up from 1.8805; 1.6805 Swiss francs, up from 1.6742; 6.3735 French francs, up from 6.3650; 2.1270 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1220; 1,379.50 Italian lire, up from 1,377.50; and 1.1830 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1835. Earlier in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar closed at 133.85 Japanese yen, up from 132.49 yen late Friday.

<HEAD>Polaroid Chief Says Kodak Competition Would Have Taken `Bread and

 <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> took pains to avoid competition with <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the chairman testified Tuesday in the opening of testimony in a trial over damages <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> should pay for infringing on its rival's instant-photography technology. In the first day of testimony in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCune </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> began to outline the steps that led to head-to-head competition with <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, is seeking $ 12 billion in damages from <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> for infringing on instant photography patents. An earlier court decision found infringement occurred. <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, N.Y.-based <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> says it should pay $ 177 million, equal to 5 percent royalties on the instant cameras and film <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> sold from 1976 until 1985. <PERSON> McCune </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Kodk </PERSON> had a productive working relationship for decades. But things soured in the late 1960s, he said, when <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> was working on its revolutionary SX-70 camera. <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>, which for years had manufactured film for <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>, was asked to produce the new, complex negative that <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> had developed for the instant, color camera. But <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> demanded a license from Polaroid, <PERSON> McCune </PERSON> testified, which would have allowed <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> to develop its own instant photography. `` There was considerable reluctance to undertake the project unless we gave them license,'' <PERSON> McCune </PERSON> said under questioning by <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>. `` A stumbling block was always that we could n't see how giving <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> a license to make products competitive with ours would allow us to stay in business.'' Polaroid ultimately built its own film manufacturing facilities in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. Instant photography, <PERSON> McCune </PERSON> said, `` is all our bread and butter and that's everything we've got.'' <PERSON> McCune </PERSON>'s testimony before Judge <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazzone </PERSON> ranged widely from the origins of instant photography after World War II to the introduction of the SX-70 camera in 1972. The story began during the war, <PERSON> McCune </PERSON> said, when <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Land </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION> on a family trip. `` He took photographs of his daughter and she asked why she could n't see it right away,'' <PERSON> McCune </PERSON> said. `` He wondered too.'' By 1963, with manufacturing help from <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> developed the first color instant photography. `` The business grew rapidly in that period,'' <PERSON> McCune </PERSON> said. Revenue of $ 129 million in 1963 jumped to $ 571 million in 1972. <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s profits after taxes increased from $ 25 million to $ 75 million in that time. With the introduction of the SX-70, <PERSON> McCune </PERSON> said, <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> hoped for a dramatic increase in its business. `` We viewed it as a revolutionary step and thought it was going to dramatically increase the business of the company and increase the life of the business,'' <PERSON> McCune </PERSON> said. But as <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s lawyers have already argued, <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>'s competition beginning in 1976 cut into profits and forced <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> to sell some cameras below cost If <PERSON> Mazzone </PERSON> awards Polaroid anything close to $ 12 billion, it will be the largest patent infringement decision in history, far surpassing the record $ 207 million that <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> was ordered to pay <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> three years ago for copying drill bit technology.

<HEAD>Propelled by Demand for Aircraft, Orders Rise in March</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government reported Tuesday that orders to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories for manufactured goods increased 0.7 percent in March, but analysts still saw signs in the report that the economy was cooling off. Orders for durable and non-durable goods rose to a seasonally adjusted $ 232.9 billion in March after dropping 2 percent in February and 1.2 percent in January, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported. The gain last month was propelled by a big jump in transportation orders, which surged 10.1 percent on the strength of a 48.3 percent increase in orders for aircraft, missiles and parts. Excluding transportation, a category that is subject to wide swings depending on when big contracts are signed, all other orders were down 0.9 percent in March after declining 1 percent in February. Analysts said the report added to signs that economic growth is slackening, but also demonstrated the economy still has some strength left. `` I do n't think the economy is as weak as some of the recent signs have been showing,'' said economist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagens </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Wefa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cynwyd </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> `` Calling it a full-fledged slowdown right now is a little bit premature.'' <PERSON> Hagens </PERSON> said that with aircraft manufacturers already holding big backlogs of unfilled orders, the latest surge in orders in that category was unlikely to have much immediate effect on economic activity. He said the report showed some strength in orders for computers and other equipment, while demand in construction-related industries remained weak. Orders in the volatile defense category, which overlaps transportation, also showed strength in March, rising 28.8 percent after an increase of 19.7 percent in February. Excluding defense, all other orders in March were down 0.3 percent after falling 2.7 percent in February. Economist <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> DeFina </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> said the report was consistent with other recent signs that the economy may be slowing down, noting that orders for non-defense capital goods have fluctuated in recent months and that factory shipments were down in March as backlogs of unfilled orders increased. `` They all seem to fit in with this picture of a slowing economy,'' he said. However, economist <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said that while orders last quarter were slower than during the strong fourth quarter of 1988, manufacturing still shows enough strength that inflationary pressures could mount `` There's a little bit of a slowdown that's not worth a lot,'' <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON> said. `` I would still be concerned about the risks of inflation here much more than the risk of recession.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> gave these details on factory orders in March: _ Orders for non-defense capital goods, considered a barometer of business investment plans, were up 2.4 percent in March after falling 7.8 percent in February and rising 2.3 percent in January _ Boosted by the strong demand for aircraft, orders for `` big ticket'' durable goods were up 0.9 percent in March to a seasonally adjusted $ 125.2 billion after falling in the previous two months Excluding aircraft, durable goods orders declined 3.6 percent. _ Orders for non-durable goods were up 0.5 percent in March to a seasonally adjusted $ 107.7 billion after dropping 0.4 percent in February _ Shipments of manufactured goods declined 0.1 percent in March to a seasonally adjusted $ 228.1 billion, after falling 1.4 percent in February

 <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s profit rose 24 percent in the second quarter of its fiscal year, thanks to free-spending visitors at the company's amusement parks. Disney reported Tuesday it earned $ 149 million, or $ 1.08 a share, up from $ 120.1 million, or 87 cents a share, in the second quarter of its 1989 fiscal year. Sales in the quarter ended March 31 were $ 1.04 billion, up 14 percent from $ 774.5 million a year earlier. Operating income from theme parks, which account for the lion's share of <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> business, rose 43 percent in the latest quarter because of higher per-capita guest spending, strong attendance and improved resort operations, the company said A new studio tour opened at <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> this week. Operating income in the filmed entertainment division was 21 percent lower than in the comparable quarter last year, when money was rolling in from the hit movies `` Three Men and a Baby'' and `` Good Morning, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>.'' Revenue from filmed entertainment was 28 percent higher than a year ago. The consumer products division, which includes a growing chain of shops selling Disney toys and clothes, recorded a 32 percent rise in operating income.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Oil futures prices retreated in active trading Tuesday, reflecting market concerns about overproduction among <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the June contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, lost 86 cents to settle at $ 19.80 a barrel, after rising 24 cents on Monday. Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange, the June contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline settled 1.36 cents lower to 71.25 cents a gallon. The contract had risen 1.39 cents in the previous session. June home heating oil, which declined 0.31 cent Monday, fell another 1.85 cents Tuesday to 47.61 cents a gallon. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON>, an energy analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said profit-taking from the recent jump in crude and gasoline prices and concerns about <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> overproduction largely were responsible for Tuesday's selloff. `` There's a growing belief that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> is producing 22 million barrels'' daily, he said. The 13-member <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> agreed last year to a daily production level of 18.5 million barrels for the first half of 1989. Quotas for the second half of the year are expected to be discussed at a June <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> meeting and analysts predict cartel members will seek to expand production in light of the recent price runup. Adding to the market slump Tuesday was speculation that the transportation and production system in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> would resume operations next week following an April 18 explosion at a gasoline platform that disrupted operations, analysts said. The <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> accident and the Exxon oil spill off the Alaskan coast in March have helped to significantly boost oil prices, particularly gasoline and crude.

 Despite record sales, <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s fiscal first-quarter profit fell 23 percent due to costs associated with last year's purchase of Sterling Drug Co The announcement caught many stock analysts by surprise and sent the photo giant's stock tumbling on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where it closed down $ 3.12 -LCB- a share to $ 43.75. `` I was looking for an unimpressive quarter, but these numbers are definitely lower than I and most everyone else anticipated,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Obenzinger </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Wood </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gundy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. For the quarter, which ended March 19, the company reported a profit of $ 200 million, or 62 cents a share, compared with $ 260 million, or 80 cents a share, for the same period a year ago Sales for the quarter totaled a record $ 3.9 billion, up 17 percent from last year when they were $ 3.3 billion. The earnings decline was largely a result of adding in three months, instead of one month, of costs and interest expense for Sterling Drug, which <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> bought last February for $ 5.1 billion. `` That's a major difference,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>. For example, interest expenses in last year's first quarter totaled $ 92 million. This year they were $ 192 million. Marketing and administrative costs were $ 869 million. In this year's initial quarter, they climbed $ 206 million, to $ 1.07 billion. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> also said less favorable currency-exchange rates and the general cost of inflation contributed to higher costs for <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>. However, <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> noted that last year's first quarter was the best in company history and this year's first-quarter earnings are the third-highest. `` The first quarter rarely provides good insight into performance expectations due to the seasonality of our business,'' said <PERSON> Colby </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive officer. The first three months of the year are generally <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>'s slowest time because people do not take as many pictures as they do in the spring, summer and fall. <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> said he still predicts the company will achieve record earnings this year, but it's not going to be easy.

 The dollar finished higher against several key currencies Tuesday, defying central bank attempts to dilute its value through coordinated selling on foreign-exchange markets. Gold weakened slightly. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted bullion at $ 376.35 a troy ounce, down from $ 377.45 Monday. Currency strategists said the dollar's behavior reflected a big underlying demand for the currency, a consequence of what they called the resiliently strong <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy and relatively high American interest rates that make dollar-denominated investments more attractive. They also attributed some of the dollar's strength to pent-up orders for the currency overseas, where many markets were closed Monday for the May Day labor holiday. The dollar fell early in the day when the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> and central banks in other key <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trading partners sold dollars to blunt the currency's appreciation. But when traders realized why the dollar was falling, they started buying it aggressively and the dollar rose again, finishing higher against the yen, mark and French franc and nearly unchanged vs. the British pound and a few other important currencies. `` The sentiment is definitely continuing to be bullish,'' said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, a senior dealer at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> branch of <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Julius </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` Unless the intervention gets more serious, traders will just see it as an excuse to buy cheap dollars.'' In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar closed at 133.85 Japanese yen, up from 132.49 yen the previous session. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar traded at 133.82 yen. Later in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the dollar fetched 134.27 yen, up from 134.13 yen the previous session.

 Petroleum futures prices dropped sharply Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as traders reacted to reports that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> nations are exceeding their production limits. In other markets, grain and soybean prices dropped; precious metals closed lower on light trading, and livestock and pork prices rallied. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 35 cents to 89 cents lower with the contract for delivery in June at $ 19.80 a barrel; heating oil was 1.19 cents to 1.85 cents lower with June at 47.61 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .42 cent to 1.36 cents lower with June at 7.25 cents a gallon. `` It was a bloodbath,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Samuels </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Prices dropped in active trading as traders who bought on the assumption prices would go up liquidated their holdings as the market broke the $ 20.50 barrier. `` There was no fresh news that would warrant such a move down,'' said <PERSON> Samuels </PERSON>. `` There is continued concern from <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> overproduction.'' Word was that in April, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> surpassed its production limit of 4.5 million barrels a day, with daily production reaching 4.9 million barrels to 5 million barrels. `` That is not so much, but there are reports the Kuwaitis _ who have a million barrels per day limit _ produced 1.7 million barrels daily,'' <PERSON> Samuels </PERSON> said. Gasoline futures were forced down by the selling of crude oil futures, but overall, prices remain steady, said <PERSON> Samuels </PERSON>, adding the fall in gasoline prices is likely to be more temporary than the drop in crude oil and heating oil. Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly lower on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as traders reacted to short-term weather forecasts calling for above-average rainfall. Wheat prices rose in anticipation of an announcement by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration on additional subsidized grain sales to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. After the close of trading, the White House announced the sale of 1.5 million metric tons of wheat to the Soviets under the export bonus program. The wheat is for delivery in May and June. Wheat prices also were helped by word that the condition of the red winter wheat crop in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> has deteriorated further. `` There was light volume,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Freed </PERSON> an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` The market is nervous about the weather.'' Lower soybean and corn prices followed the release of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s 6 - to 10-day forecast for wetter-than-normal conditions next week in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> Wheat settled 1 -LCB- cents to 3 cents higher with the contract for delivery in May at $ 4.26 -LCB- a bushel; corn was -LCB- cent to 2 -LCB- cents lower with May at $ 2.73 -LCB- a bushel; oats were a \ cent to 3 cents lower with May at $ 1.84 \ a bushel; soybeans were 1 \ cent to 5 cents lower with May at $ 7.34 a Livestock and pork futures were higher on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> with prices buoyed by better than expected cash prices. `` Traders had n't expected it to be so strong,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Sterling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. Pork prices were helped by a <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> ruling that <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> was subsidizing pork exports and that may prompt the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to impose duties on Canadian pork products Live cattle settled .18 cent to .60 cent higher with June at 72.05 cents a pound; feeder cattle was .30 cent to .65 cent higher with May at 76.72 cents a pound; hogs were .08 cent to .62 cent higher with June at 47.42 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .10 cent to .88 cent higher with May at 31.75 cents a pound. Gold and silver futures prices dropped in sluggish trading on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. `` There is a lot of gold and a lot of silver around, and there's not a lot of reasons to buy,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Syphen </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gold settled 40 cents to $ 1.70 lower, with May at $ 377.80 a troy ounce; silver was 2.9 cents to 3.2 cents lower with May at $ 5.617 a troy ounce.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest airline company, said Tuesday it lost $ 255.5 million for the first quarter of 1989, most of which was attributed to strikebound <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. The holding company's loss for the three-month period came on revenue of $ 1.9 billion and contrasted with a loss of $ 124.3 million on revenue of $ 2.2 billion during the same three months in 1988. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> owns Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> as well as <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> One </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION>, an airline reservation system. Eastern has been in bankruptcy protection from creditors since March 9, five days after the start of a bruising strike by its Machinists union that was supported by pilots and flight attendants. Miami-based Eastern by itself recorded a loss of $ 255.2 million on revenues of $ 620.6 million before a $ 10.4 million charge for dividends payable to its preferred stockholders. During the first quarter of 1988, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> had a loss of $ 31 million on revenues of $ 1.1 billion before a $ 14.1 million charge for dividends payable to its preferred stockholders. Eastern virtually shut down operations March 4 when its machinists went on strike and its pilots and flight attendants honored the picket lines. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakes </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s president and chief executive, said in a statement that `` while further substantial operating losses should be expected for the second quarter, the company's business plan which was recently submitted to our creditors and 5,000 working employees shows dramatic future improvements. `` Additionally, cash resources will increase dramatically as a result of the planned disposition of certain assets that will allow us to pay down substantial amount of debt, satisfy all bankruptcy liabilities and finish the year with substantial cash resources.'' Bakes said the airline's cash resources will increase `` dramatically'' from <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s new plan to rebuild as a smaller carrier and sell $ 1.8 billion in assets separately. All such sales must be approved by a federal bankruptcy court in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> has called a hearing for Wednesday on the issue of auctioning Eastern in its entirety, including its Northeast shuttle service slated to be sold to developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> for $ 365 million. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> posted a first-quarter loss of $ 16.5 million on revenues of $ 1.2 billion compared with a net loss of $ 80.6 million on revenue of $ 1.1 billion for the first quarter of 1988. The losses at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> were partly offset by profits of other units that do not individually report their results, including <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> One </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> said.

 <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> announced Tuesday he has been fired as president and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> Coleman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the maker of <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> lanterns and other outdoor products that was founded by his grandfather. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said Wall Street takeover strategist <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Perelman </PERSON>, who bought the company six weeks ago, terminated him during a meeting Monday night in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said the decision was reaffirmed Tuesday. <PERSON> Perelman </PERSON> and his staff had said they wanted <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> to stay on as chief executive officer. <PERSON> Perelman </PERSON> probably is best known for his 1985 purchase for $ 1.8 billion of the <ORGANIZATION> Revlon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and his acquisition of five failing savings and loans in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, a move that gave him significant tax advantages. At a news conference, <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, 36, said he was told Monday he and <PERSON> Perelman </PERSON>'s acquisition corporation should part company because he `` did n't respond enthusiastically enough or quickly enough to some of their suggestions'' about his possible role on the new management team. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said each time <PERSON> Perelman </PERSON>'s executives, whom he described as `` extremely intelligent, fast-moving, hard-charging people,'' proposed duties for him, he asked to have some time to consider the proposal. By the time he was ready to respond in each instance, the suggested duties had changed, he said. `` The roles changed with each meeting we had,'' he said. `` I think they have tried to treat me well,'' <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said. `` It is not a happy time for me. I'm extremely sad to be leaving a company that has been part of our family for 89 years.'' <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Perelman </PERSON>'s newly formed acquistion company, <ORGANIZATION> Lantern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acquisition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, had n't appointed anyone to succeed him. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> McIlwaine </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Coleman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> corporate communications, issued a statement saying the corporation's new owners had decided it was time for a change in top management. The statement said the company's `` current operating management'' would be retained and a new chief executive officer would be appointed soon. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>'s severance package provides him a cash payment of approximately $ 250,000. His firing leaves only one <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> relative involved in the company. <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> <PERSON> Denning </PERSON>, the grandson of <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>'s uncle <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON>, is controller for <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> International in <LOCATION> Redmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash </LOCATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> pledged Tuesday to direct a nationwide boycott of <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T if union members strike later this month. The strategy could cost the long-distance giant millions of dollars while giving union business to a non-union company. The labor federation's governing body approved the plan, which asks the 14 million members of the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> and its affiliated unions to route their long-distance calls via non-union <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` You have a choice between a struck company and a non-union company,'' <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> told reporters after the first day of the federation's spring meeting. `` If you want to make a telephone call, those are your choices,'' <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said. `` Under those circumstances, you take the lesser of two evils.'' By placing calls through <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION>'s five-digit access number, the unions and their members could boycott <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> without permanently changing long-distance carriers and could easily begin using <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T again after the end of a work stoppage. Some larger <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> unions pay as much as $ 1 million a month in <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T bills; labor's total bills amount to at least $ 100 million annually, federation officials said. The boycott plan was drafted by the <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>. Those unions are negotiating with the <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T but have made little progress toward resolving substantial differences over wages and health care. Officials of both unions say their talks, which opened the last week of March, snagged immediately over an <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> proposal to shift health care costs to workers by making employees pay 20 percent of medical bills and by placing caps on lifetime and retiree benefits. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> says its current health care plan, which fully pays medical expenses, costs $ 1 billion a year. The unions say they also expect major differences with the company on wages but have n't goten to that because of the health care debate. Contracts for 175,000 union members expire May 27. Long-distance charges are <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION>'s largest income source. <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Francine </PERSON> <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON> said both unions, in the event of a boycott, would recommend that unions and the members use <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> because <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> owns part of <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> and workers at GTE-owned regional phone companies are represented by unions. She said no workers at other long-distance carriers are represented by unions or have any link to a union-represented company. AT & amp; T officials have criticized the plan, saying the unions could hurt their members by sending business to competitors. But the unions have said they need such options to mount an effective strike because technology would allow <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T to continue long-distance service even if both unions walked off the job.

 <ORGANIZATION> Allergan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Optical </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Tuesday introduced contact lenses that the companies said pose less health risk to eyes than any extended-wear soft lenses currently available The Allergan Advent lenses are designed to meet the eye's critical need for oxygen, the companies said at a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> news conference The flexible material of the new lens allows virtually the same amount of oxygen to reach the eye as when no lens is being worn, the companies said. Reduced oxygen has been identified as one of key dangers of overnight and long-term lens wearing. It can cause abnormal swelling of the eye's outer coating, the cornea, and lead to permanent vision-distoring eye damage. The Advent lenses, which will be available nationally later this month, establish a new, fourth category of contact lens, which 3M and <ORGANIZATION> Allergan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Optical </ORGANIZATION> call Flexible Fluoropolymer. Existing lenses on the market come under one of three categories: hard, soft or rigid gas permeable. The new lenses also are designed to be more resistant to the buildup of deposits, making them easier to care for. Deposits can impair the vision-enhancing properties of lenses, cause discomfort and possibly eye infections. The safety of extended-wear lenses has been the subject of study and debate in the eye care industry for years. Last month <ORGANIZATION> Bausch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lomb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the world's leading maker of contact lenses, started to advise against keeping in its extended-wear soft contact lenses for more than a week without removing and cleaning them. Extended-wear lenses, which debuted commercially in 1984, currently have government approval to be worn continuously for up to 30 days. But the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administraion </ORGANIZATION> has said it is reviewing its policy and the agency is expected to urge contact lens makers to voluntarily shorten the maximum period for wearing their lenses to a week. <ORGANIZATION> Allergan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Optical </ORGANIZATION>, a maker of lenses and lens-care products and a division of <ORGANIZATION> Allergan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, has set seven days as the maximum suggested wearing time for the Advent lenses. They are recommended for people who regularly wear lenses for extended periods or occasionally overnight. The Allergan Advents are expected to compete directly with disposable lenses, such as the AcuVue lens made by a division of <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. The Allergan Advents, listed for $ 70 per lens, will be manufactured by a unit of 3M.

 <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> reached agreement in principle Tuesday on a contract for the carrier's 23,000 ground service workers after 2 -LCB- weeks of mediation. Details of the contract were not released pending agreement on final language and a vote by the membership. A company news release said the agreement was reached after 27 hours of continuous bargaining. The release said American Vice President <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Pasciuto </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> TWU </ORGANIZATION> International Vice President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerrigan </PERSON> `` said the agreement benefits both the company and the union and will enable <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> to continue the growth plan that has made the airline an industry leader.'' The mediation was requested after union members turned down <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 610 million offer. The offer included raises of as much as 99 percent for some workers, but union leaders objected to a two-tier wage scale under which it takes new hires as long as 12 years to reach top pay. The union had sought to reduce that to about five years. The union also objected to provisions under which employees would contribute to the company health plan for the first time. Airline officials complained that the contract was a victim of union politics because several locals were in the midst of election campaigns and candidates used the contract as an issue. The four-year pact became amendable on March 1. Under federal law, airline contracts do not expire. If the two sides can not reach agreement, a mediator is called in to spark negotiations; if the mediator declares an impasse in the talks, there is then a 30-day cooling off period. A strike can be called only after that period expires. The <ORGANIZATION> TWU </ORGANIZATION> represents about 23,000 of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION>'s 67,000 employees. Its members include the airline's mechanics, bag handlers, ground crews, stock clerks, guards, meteorologists and aircraft cleaners. Also Tuesday, American's parent company, <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, confirmed it is on the verge of ordering about 100 new commuter aircraft in a `` several hundred million dollar'' deal. The aircraft, seating 30-40 people, would be used for the company's <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary that feeds some of its major hubs. Published reports have said the company is leaning toward Swedish manufacture <ORGANIZATION> Saab </ORGANIZATION>, although others mentioned as possible suppliers include <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada-DeHavilland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION>, based near <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> ATR </ORGANIZATION>, a French-Italian company. Fort Worth-based AMR is coming off its most profitable year ever, during which it became the nation's largest carrier. <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> posted a 1988 profit of $ 476.8 million, a 140.3 percent increase from 1987 and 37.9 percent higher than the previous record of $ 345.8 million in 1985. The company also reported a first-quarter profit of $ 101 million, a 47.7 percent jump from 1988's first three months. Operating revenues were $ 2.45 billion. The purchase would be the fourth by American this year. In March, American announced a $ 3.09 billion deal with Dutch manufacturer <ORGANIZATION> Fokker </ORGANIZATION> for 75 F-100 planes and options for another 75; and an approximately $ 2 billion purchase of 25 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 757s and 10 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 767s. On Feb. 7, American announced another $ 7 billion deal to buy eight <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> jets with options for another 142.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> gave final approval Tuesday to <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s takeover of the <ORGANIZATION> Flying </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> air cargo service on the condition that Federal give up its U.S.-Japan small package service. Approval came after the White House indicated it would not object to the acquisition, according to documents filed by the department. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> earlier said it would not oppose the $ 880 million deal announced in December 1988 by both companies. The acquisition gives <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, Tenn.-based <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> a foothold in the international air cargo business. The department order considered several objections from other air freight companies. It transfers the foreign certificate authorities of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flying </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tiger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, also known as <ORGANIZATION> Flying </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION>, to <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>, provided that Federal surrenders its certificate for small package service between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, effective with the start of service by a replacement carrier. The new certificates are issued both in the names of <ORGANIZATION> Flying </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>, giving the company the option of operating under either name. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>, which serves the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with 104 cargo jets and 137 smaller planes, established routes to <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> before acquiring <ORGANIZATION> Flying </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION>. It has 63,000 employees worldwide. Flying Tigers, with 6,500 employees, operates 37 cargo jets and two passengers planes, with scheduled cargo service to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. The Flying Tiger Line was founded in 1945 by pilots who fought with Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Claire </PERSON> <PERSON> Chennault </PERSON>'s fighter group, the <ORGANIZATION> Flying </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION>, which flew missions over <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1941. Tiger International, <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION>' parent company, almost was forced into liquidation in 1986 after a run of losses analysts blamed on unsuccessful diversification efforts, high salaries and high fuel prices. But employees agreed to take a pay cut. The company showed a profit last year and paid employees $ 16.5 million in profit-sharing.

<HEAD>LTV First Quarter Net Income Declines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, buffeted by cost increases in aircraft programs and a 25 percent decline in steel operating income, reported a first-quarter profit Tuesday of $ 76.6 million, down sharply from a year earlier excluding a one-time charge. In the first quarter of 1988, the Dallas-based conglomerate suffered a net loss of $ 2.12 billion, but that period included a one-time charge of $ 2.26 billion resulting from a change in accounting for post-employment medical and life insurance benefits. Without the charge, <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION>'s income for the first quarter of 1988 was $ 131.2 million. First quarter sales declined, to $ 1.6 billion from $ 1.9 billion in the first quarter in 1988. Sales results for the company's steel bar division were being held for disposition. Sales declines in aircraft and energy products were offset by higher sales in missiles and electronics. In releasing its first quarter earnings, the company said cost increases are expected in its YA-7F aircraft development program and higher unit costs are projected on production of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 commercial aircraft components. `` The decline in first quarter sales and operating income reflects <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION>'s continuing rationalization of steel operations and the cost increases in the two aircraft programs,'' said <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hay </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer. <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> attributed the decline in steel operating income to the sale last year of its Warren, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, steel plant. `` Demand for flat rolled steel remained firm, most of our facilities are operating at a high percentage of capacity and orders are strong through the second quarter,'' <PERSON> Hay </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> proposed on Tuesday to limit the maximum amounts of 38 types of cancer-causing chemicals and other pollutants found in drinking water, a move that will cause increases in some household water bills. But the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said it ca n't meet a congressional deadline on two dozen other water pollutants because it is short of money and staff. The 38 chemicals, including many widely used pesticides and other highly toxic carcinogens, must be monitored and kept below the required levels in all public drinking water under the EPA regulations issued Tuesday. The rules will be made final after a period for public comment. But <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials said local water officials will have another 18 months before they will be required to comply. Even longer phase-in periods could be negotiated if local officials can show economic hardship, officials said. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> office which deals with drinking water contaminants, said most public water systems already meet the proposed requirements, but additional purification equipment will probably be needed in about 2,500 public systems, serving about 2 million people, mostly in rural areas. In some cases, a household water bill could go up as much as $ 460 a year, although the increase will generally be much lower, <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said. The additional costs will chiefly be because of equipment. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> estimated that the cost of public water in areas where additional pollution controls are required could increase from $ 10 to $ 460 a year, depending on the size of the water system and the contaminant and treatment technology involved. The water systems likely to be in violation of the federal standard will account for roughly 3 percent of all the water systems in the country and provide water for 2 million people, said <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>. Private wells are not covered by the regulations. <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said that when the regulations, covering 17 pesticides and 21 other pollutants, take effect, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> will have established maximum allowable levels for 55 of 83 dangerous drinking water contaminants singled out for action by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> nearly three years ago. Many of those federal standards probably will not go into effect for another year or more, however. Three years ago, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> told the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to establish federal standards on all 83 pollutants by June 1 of this year, but <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said the agency wo n't be able to meet the deadline on the 28 remaining chemicals. He said the process is expected to take another year as maximum safe levels and water treatment techniques for each of the remaining contaminants are worked out. `` If we had more money and manpower we could have sped those -LRB- calculations -RRB- up,'' said <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, blaming agency budget constraints and staff shortages for not being able to meet the deadline. The proposed standards cover 17 pesticides including alachlor, aldicarb and atrazine, which are widely used in agriculture; 11 synthetic organic chemicals that have been found to cause cancer or damage to the nervous system; and eight inorganic chemicals, including asbestos, mercury, cadmium, nitrates and nitrites; and two chemicals used to treat drinking water. The regulations also will require local water officials to monitor the chemical levels in their water supply, at times as frequently as every three months, and to make public those occasions when the federal standards are exceeded. While most of the nation's water supply is already thought to be in compliance with the federal standards, <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said about 2,500 small, mostly rural water systems likely will violate the regulations unless they install additional equipment. Officials operating about 80,000 water systems likely will have to increase monitoring activities to comply with the federal rules. The requirements `` are important steps in the continuing effort to assure that Americans have the safest drinking water in the world,'' said <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>. But some <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> critics maintained that the regulations, while slow in coming, are also too weak. <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, an attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said the maximum levels required by the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> is significantly higher than ceilings already required by a number of states. Furthermore, she said, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> is lifting some water pollutant standards, including the ones for aluminum and silver. Both pose health risks, she said.

 Consumers, environmentalists and politicians in scattered cities joined Tuesday in a one-day `` Boycott Exxon'' campaign over its huge oil spill in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and over rising gasoline prices in the industry in general. State attorneys general in the <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senators from <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> called for a federal investigation of why gasoline prices have risen sharply since the March 24 <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> spill. `` We are beginning the war of words and actions against any oil company that does n't understand its responsibility to protect the environment,'' said <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> state Sen. <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Amick </PERSON> at a boycott rally in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Surette </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gasoline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retailers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Billerica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, said his group surveyed dealers Tuesday but found that it was too early to assess the impact of the boycott. <PERSON> Surette </PERSON> accused <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of `` obvious negligence'' but said it was unfair for consumers to vent their anger at dealers, most of whom are small, independent businessmen. Consumer activist <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> `` should not be allowed to forget'' the Alaskan spill and that a boycott was the way to send a message to the oil giant. <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> joined representatives from several environmental and consumer groups in accusing Exxon of failing to be prepared for the spill and not rapidly responding to the accident that has fouled hundreds of miles of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s coast. Consumer groups in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state also asked consumers to join the boycott. In <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, about 400 chanting and sign-waving protesters rallied in front of <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> headquarters, urging consumers to boycott Exxon products. In <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, more than 100 people rallied in the shadow of Alaskan oil tankers being repaired at the shipyard where the ruptured <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> is scheduled to be inspected next month. Business was off at <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Keyes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Sicklerville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, where some customers cut up their <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> credit cards and turned them in. `` In the morning you -LRB- usually -RRB- get a lot of business here, but it's dropped off,'' said mechanic <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Saiia </PERSON> said. `` Ai n't nobody in there.'' <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement calling the boycott unjust, and added: `` Exxon believes in the basic fairness of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people and is confident that they will see <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s employees, dealers and owners as victims of human error, not as an institution that should be discriminated against for an accident that occurred while we were doing our job.'' Concern over tight gasoline supplies for the summer driving season escalated following the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil spill and an explosion at a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> oil rig. Crude oil prices have risen more than $ 7 a barrel since January. Since the Exxon Valdez accident, gas prices have increased an average 10 percent nationally, while the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> saw surges as high as 25 percent in less than a month, said <PERSON> Marla </PERSON> <PERSON> Rae </PERSON>, executive assistant to <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Frohnmayer </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said 10,000 credit cards out of 7 million have been cut up and returned to the company since the spill. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> said it had received no reports from dealers of a loss in volume of gasoline sold as a result of the credit card return or from boycotts. About 5 percent, or 620, of the 12,400 Exxon brand stations in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are owned and operated by <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>. The rest are independent. The Exxon boycott was endorsed by 16 Democratic <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> legislators. `` We want to show Exxon that corporations who harm the environment will pay a price in the marketplace,'' said Assemblyman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON>. Twenty <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> legislators also joined Tuesday in a call to support the boycott. Attorneys general of three <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> states want the nation's chief law officer to investigate why oil prices have risen sharply, especially since the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> ripped its hull on a reef in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> <PERSON> Frohnmayer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Eikenberry </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> announced Monday they will ask <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, for an investigation of gas prices. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sens. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Exon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON>, both <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> Democrats, called on <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> to investigate potential price gouging by the industry since the spill. They noted that gas prices in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> rose 20 percent from the first of March until mid-April.

 <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helicopter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday announced the planned layoff of 450 workers this month, with about the same number to follow next year. President <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> blamed the firings on a slowdown in attack helicopter production. He said temporary and regular employees would be laid off, including workers at plants in <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Culver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and in all divisions. The helicopter division of <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has 5,000 employees at its <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> plant and 3,000 in <LOCATION> Culver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The company has been building about 10 AH-64 Apache attack helicopters a month, but the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> has ordered that rate cut back to six a month beginning June 1990. <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> has delivered about 460 Apaches on a contract that called for 975.

As many as four groups of friendly investors have expressed an interest in buying or investing in the airline but do n't want to face the possibility of a pilots' strike, <PERSON> Rothmeier </PERSON> has The contract would unify the wages, seniority rights and working conditions of the pilots, who have been working under separate pacts since <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> acquired <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> in the fall of 1986. `` There are more than 100 items that we are in disagreement over,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Halvorson </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. Important issues left unresolved include earnings and the right for <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> to use non-union labor. The pilots want assurances that non-union pilots wo n't be hired to fly new planes purchased by <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s jet leasing subsidiary, <PERSON> Halvorson </PERSON> said. `` Any airplanes they buy, we fly,'' he said. <PERSON> Rothmeier </PERSON> has said the company's position on the issue is firm. Northwest has offered only small hourly wage increases, but has said wages for most pilots will increase as much as 38 percent under a broad upgrade in classifications for current pilots. `` The concept is good, but the numbers that they gave us were not'' adequate, <PERSON> Halvorson </PERSON> said. Talks between the two sides were last held in mid-April and broke off as scheduled. <PERSON> Rothmeier </PERSON> pleaded for expedited negotiations because of the takeover threat, but the pilots declined. Northwest spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON> said the company would not comment on the status of negotiations.

 <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> blamed the state <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utility </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> as it announced Tuesday a $ 5.7 million loss for the first quarter and a suspension of its common-stock dividend for the rest of 1989. The loss was blamed on disastrous investments in a nuclear power plant and in non-utility-related real estate. A spokesman said the company's $ 20 million in tax writeoffs for the quarter were an effort to cut its losses and begin recovering from bad investments. For the quarter, the company lost $ 5.7 million on revenue of $ 95.3 million, compared with earnings of $ 13.9 million, or 40 cents a share, on revenue of $ 89.5 million during the first three months of 1988. The company suspended sales of the over-the-counter stock Tuesday morning, a few hours before it announced it was suspending dividend payments on 35 million shares of common stock. Trading did not resume Tuesday, and the stock closed at $ 8.25, down 25 cents. Spokesman <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> said trading will resume Wednesday morning. <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> wrote off $ 15 million in investments in the <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION> nuclear plant near <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, and $ 5 million in real estate losses during the quarter. The utility said its board of directors decided to write off the <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION> loss because the company did n't get a rate increase it wanted. The <ORGANIZATION> PUC </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday granted it a rate increase of $ 15 million _ $ 23 million less than the company sought. The utility said it needed a $ 38 million rate increase over two years to pay for a sale and lease-back of its share in <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION>. After taxes, the company's loss from the plant was reduced from $ 23 million to $ 15 million.

<HEAD>Browning-Ferris, Wellman Announce Recycling Agreement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>

 <ORGANIZATION> Browning-Ferris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, one of the nation's largest trash haulers, said Tuesday it reached an agreement to supply plastic refuse to the nation's largest plastics recycling company. Under the agreement, <ORGANIZATION> BFI </ORGANIZATION> will ship plastics from its curb-side collection programs, recycling program and processing centers to <ORGANIZATION> Wellman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s facilities in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, officials said. `` This will serve everyone's needs,'' <ORGANIZATION> BFI </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruckelshaus </PERSON> said. `` It is expected to guarantee an assured market for all the plastics we are collecting in our recycling programs now and as we expand, to provide <PERSON> Wellman </PERSON> a growing supply of plastics so they can continue to grow,'' <PERSON> Ruckelshaus </PERSON> said. Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> BFI </ORGANIZATION> described the deal as the first of its kind between a major waste service and a recycling company. Terms of the agreement were not disclosed. <PERSON> Wellman </PERSON>, with 1988 sales of $ 314.6 million, manufactures a variety of products from waste plastics and other materials. Its primary raw materials are reclaimed soft drink bottles. `` We have long maintained that the key to effective plastic recycling lies primarily in establishing an effective and efficient collection program,'' Wellman President <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Duff </PERSON> said. `` Since <ORGANIZATION> BFI </ORGANIZATION>'s interest is also business-driven, we are confident that this joint effort will be successful.'' <ORGANIZATION> BFI </ORGANIZATION>, which has been involved in recycling since 1971, operates curb-side recovery programs that include yard wastes, paper, metal and glass containers, plastics and oil. The company also operates `` Recycleries,'' where materials for recycling are extracted from waste and where other materials are collected from the public. <ORGANIZATION> BFI </ORGANIZATION> also is involved in municipal and commercial sweeping operations, medical waste services, portable restroom services and asbestos abatement.
