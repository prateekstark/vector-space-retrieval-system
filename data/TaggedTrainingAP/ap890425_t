<HEAD>52 Students Arrested After Takeover Of University of Massachusetts
Building</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMHERST, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Fifty-two students were arrested Tuesday evening after occupying a University of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> building overnight to protest Defense Department-funded research. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, thousands of <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> students got an unscheduled holiday after demonstrators occupied the campus administration building to protest possible tuition increases, prompting officials to suspend classes. About 60 police in riot gear arrived at the University of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> around 5 p.m.. About two hours later, a bus drove away with 29 students who had camped inside Memorial Hall Those students were charged with trespassing, and another 23 students were arrested for lying in front of the bus to prevent it from leaving, police said. About 300 students stood outside the building chanting and looking on as the students inside the hall were arrested. About 35 students had occupied Memorial Hall since 1 p.m. Monday. They declined an offer to meet with administrators in the provost's office Tuesday morning, and instead presented a list of demands that included a halt to all <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> research at the 25,000-student campus. About 40 students left the building Tuesday morning after several university administrators told them they would be arrested after 5 p.m., said university spokeswoman <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>. The takeover was the second at the western <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> campus in a week. Seven protesters were arrested April 19 on charges of disorderly conduct and trespassing after also demonstrating against military-funded research on campus, particularly research into anthrax. All research at the university is non-classified and researchers must make their work public under university rules. About $ 11.6 million, or 22 percent of grant money received at the university, came from the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in 1988, according to the school. Chancellor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> issued a statement telling the students the research would continue on campus until school administrators decide differently. `` The policy will not be negotiated with students,'' <PERSON> Duffey </PERSON> said. The latest occupation began when students rallying Monday at the Student Union against military research marched toward the administration building. Several then ducked into Memorial Hall en route, and more followed. Members of the local chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Friends </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> have contended that the research is dangerous to the town, promotes militarism and should be banned. The university has argued the purpose of the anthrax research is peaceful and the strain of bacteria used is non-virulent and has been under study at the school for 23 years without incident. The <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION> health board has scheduled a hearing for Wednesday on the question of the safety of the anthrax research. Tuesday was the first time since 1969 that classes at <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> have been canceled because of student protests, said school spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> DeCiccio </PERSON>. Protesters demanding a face-to-face meeting with Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said they feared tuition at the college _ now $ 1,250 a year _ would be increased and the college staff would be reduced because of state budget cuts. The governor had no immediate comment. Tuition for next year has not been set, <PERSON> DeCiccio </PERSON> said.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can not `` wimp out'' on fraud in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s upcoming presidential vote and still maintain credibility in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, four <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senators said Monday after touring the region. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sens. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>., <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Robb </PERSON>, D-Va., and <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Fla </LOCATION>., hopscotched through <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> over the weekend, visiting with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> The scheduled May 7 election in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, which the senators said is widely expected to be stacked in favor of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s candidate, is a test of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attitudes toward next year's Nicaraguan elections `` We can not allow to go unchallenged what is obviously a massively fraudulent election in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>. The senators called <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> a test in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sincerity, saying the nation's actions will be used to judge attitudes toward next February's elections in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, which pit a leftist Sandinista government against the U.S.-backed Contra rebels. `` If we wimp out in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, and passively let a fraudulent election go forward ... I think our moral standing within <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and our credibility to the world community will be seriously compromised,'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must immediately focus world attention on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, persuading as many foreign observers as possible to oversee the vote even though <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has sought to ban such activities. `` One of the things we have failed to do is to bring international pressure with respect to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said reports that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had approved aid to the Panamanian opposition were understandable, because the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has legitimate economic and military interests in the nation, especially the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. But he said he was puzzled by the $ 10 million amount reported. `` I was surpised, because the people with whom we met indicated they were expecting to spend approximately $ 1 million on the oppsoition campaign, and they had already raised a substantial amount of that,'' the senator said. `` I was unclear where the figure $ 10 million came from.'' In <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, the senators said, Sandinista foreign ministry official <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> met with the senators to discuss next year's scheduled election in that country But <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> refused to answer the senators when they asked point-blank if the Sandinistas would peacefully transfer power to the winners of the February 1990 election, <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said. In a visit to the Yamales Contra camp in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said, he found the rebels in high spirits. He said they would prefer to be fighting, but understood their role in pressuring the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> to comply with their commitment to democratize <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.

 Comedian <PERSON> Lucille </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>'s first words to her daughter after last week's emergency heart surgery was about her hairdresser's appointment, actress <PERSON> Lucie </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnaz </PERSON> says. `` I went to mom's bedside where she was all tied to tubes and things and I told her, ` Hello mom, I love you,''' Miss <PERSON> Arnaz </PERSON> told 150 people Monday at the <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hotel </LOCATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> Second Century Award ceremony. `` She mumbled something under the oxygen mask, but I said I could n't hear her. Finally I asked the nurse if I could lift the mask a little to hear what she was saying. So I did, and mom said, ` Would n't you know _ this is the day I was going to get my hair done.''' Miss <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> was honored for her work in helping young people in the entertainment field. Miss <PERSON> Arnaz </PERSON> accepted the award on her mother's behalf. The 77-year-old actress was in serious condition and improving daily, said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wise </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Cedars-Sinai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. `` The outlook is very encouraging,'' he said. `` Her doctors have her in the chair for longer periods each day. Her spirits are good and she's cracking jokes.'' She was moved Monday from the cardiac surgical intensive care unit to a step-down unit, `` technically another intensive care unit,'' said Wise. `` She should be in her own room toward the end of the week. At the luncheon, Miss <PERSON> Arnaz </PERSON> said she was glad the award was n't postponed after her mother's heart attack `` because it means very, very much to her at this time. Presenting the award, comedian <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> told of being visited by Miss Ball on the second night of her <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> show, `` Once Upon a Mattress.'' `` She came backstage to visit us all and she spent 30 to 35 minutes in my dressing room answering my questions,'' Miss <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> said. Miss Ball's husband, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Morton </PERSON>, also attended the luncheon, where guests signed a huge card with the `` I Love Lucy'' heart logo and the words, `` We Love <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> _ Get Well Soon.'' Wise said the mounds of get-well wishes arriving at the hospital represents the biggest outpouring of affection for any celebrity confined to <ORGANIZATION> Cedars-Sinai </ORGANIZATION>, known as the `` hospital to the stars.'' `` We've received a tidal wave of mail with a couple thousand letters coming in today,'' said Wise. `` It's taken four volunteers several hours to sort it. She wants everything sorted so she can see every one of them when she gets home.'' Inside a package addressed to Miss Ball, <PERSON> Wise </PERSON> said, `` You can hear ` Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star' playing on a music box inside.'' The surgery was performed April 18 when doctors replaced her aorta and aortic valve with the donated organ tissue of a 27-year-old man.

 <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s top environmentalist squabbled over the pace of the oil spill cleanup Monday as skimmers in the Gulf of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> sought refuge from rough seas for the second day in a row. Hatchery owners on Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>, meanwhile, announced that 24 million salmon fry have been released into the sound, where they must swim through seas hit by the spill. The salmon had to be released Sunday and Monday in conjunction with the bloom of plankton in the sound to enhance their rate of survival. `` We really have no choice but to release them now,'' said <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarty </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the non-profit <ORGANIZATION> Prince </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sound </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aquaculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which owns three hatcheries in the sound. It is unclear what will happen to the fry as they migrate to the open sea if they encounter oil, <PERSON> McCarty </PERSON> said. As cleanup work continued in the sound, gale warnings and seas swelling to 18 feet kept aircraft on the ground and skimmers close to shore Monday, said coordinators of the military's role in the cleanup. Exxon, however, called a news conference to announce that the cleanup was ahead of the pace calculated in the oil company's federally approved plan, which figures the cleanup will be done by Sept. 15 K.T. <PERSON> Koonce </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for exploration and production, said 70 percent of the 10.1 million-gallon spill had evaporated, dissipated or been recovered. The company said 1.8 gallons had been recovered. An estimated 1.2 million gallons remains afloat. The oil spilled March 24 from the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION>, a fully loaded tanker that ran aground on <LOCATION> Bligh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reef </LOCATION> as it steered from the Valdez terminal through Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelso </PERSON>, commissioner of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s Despartment of <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION>, questioned <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s claim and said the oil company's efforts remain inadequate. `` I would look carefully at the figure and not take it at face value,'' said <PERSON> Kelso </PERSON>, adding that the estimate was based on <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s computer models and could be off by as much as 50 percent `` What I want to see is some results,'' he said after <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s news conference While the rough seas kicked oil onto beaches that had previously been spared, Monday's weather also broke up oil and increased the likelihood that more crude will be carried to the open seas of the Gulf of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. `` We see this -LRB- storm -RRB- as a good thing,'' said <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gleason </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. Fishermen from Homer and other maritime communities south of <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> have sewn absorbent material into nets and are picking up oil in much the same way they might be gathering herring this time of year. A cleanup priority has been set for beaches where seals come out with their pups each summer. Thousands of sea birds and hundreds of otters already have been found dead. State officials have canceled or postponed herring, black cod and shrimp harvests in the sound, and closed a portion of the <LOCATION> Kodiak </LOCATION> herring fishing grounds. Fisheries officials in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> were expected to decide Wednesday whether to cancel the May 15-16 halibut season. Heavy oil has been reported around the <LOCATION> Barren </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> at the mouth of <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Inlet </LOCATION> where many large boats congregate for the 24-hour open season. In <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, meanwhile, Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> warned oil companies not to use the nation's worst oil spill as an excuse to raise gasoline prices. `` If they are, it is going to be a very difficult situation for them,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who plans a firsthand look at the cleanup next month, said in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Allegations have been made that a temporary shortage of oil caused by the spill was used a pretext for gas price hikes. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> made his comments after meeting with former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> as he left on a trip to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>.

 The Associated Press will introduce three new services for readers this year to help meet the changing needs of the news industry, <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> President and General Manager <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boccardi </PERSON> said. `` I want to reaffirm something that I think you know is true, at least I hope you know is true,'' <PERSON> Boccardi </PERSON> told news executives at the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> annual meeting Monday. `` That is that I want quality service and responsiveness to be the twin themes of everything the AP does.'' Earlier Monday, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> both addressed the annual meeting and luncheon, highlighting the start of the 103rd annual convention of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, reporting on his first 100 days in office, listed among his accomplishments savings and loan legislation, ethics proposals, the beginning of a war on drugs and agreements with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on the federal budget and Contra aid. `` In three short months we've made a good start coming to grips with issues demanding urgent attention and decisive action,'' he said. At the same time, defense and foreign policy reviews, environmental legislation and a program to deal with homelessness `` are all on the near horizon,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> added. He also suggested his relationship with the media had matured after a sometimes-rocky presidential campaign. `` Both of us, government and the news media, need one another and we owe each other a measure of respect, honesty and integrity equal to the work we're engaged in,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. The president also pledged continued administration efforts to win the release of <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> corrrespondent, who last month began his fifth year as a hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Hours before departing on a trip along the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> rim </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> addressed his remarks to the `` declinists'' both at home and abroad who have predicted a diminished standing for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as a global power. `` The point that I will stress to my Asian hosts is that when Americans express doubts about the health of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> society, it's usually a sign of renewal, not of decline,'' he said <PERSON> Boccardi </PERSON>, who followed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at the luncheon, told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> annual meeting that improving technology was quickly changing the business of reporting and delivering news, and that the pace would only accelerate. As an example, he noted that this year the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> was able for the first time to deliver a presidential inauguration picture in time for East Coast afternoon newspapers, by using direct transmission from a digital camera onto the AP photo network. He said the news products to be introduced later this year are aimed at different sections of the newspaper _ new state weather maps, a sports statistic page and a regular story package aimed at readers over age 50. The state weather maps would compliment national and regional maps already provided. The AP also will supply a national weather map in color via its GraphicsNet system of computer-to-computer transmission. The full-page layout of sports agate, complete with graphic labels and headlines, would be transmitted over the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>'s GraphicsNet system and updated throughout the day The biweekly package of stories and columns aimed at Americans age 50 and over, dealing with such subjects as retirement planning, health and legislation affecting the elderly. An added staff member will be assigned to this package, called `` Prime Time.'' In his `` report card'' to the members, <PERSON> Boccardi </PERSON> also said the AP this year will complete the conversion to a 9,000-word-a-minute high-speed transmission system for <ORGANIZATION> DataStream </ORGANIZATION> and DataFeature news copy, after a delay caused by a worldwide shortage of advanced computer memory chips. He also said a new highspeed photo service, PhotoStream, will be running on a test-basis by mid-year. The <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>'s annual report noted that 72 more daily newspapers joined the news cooperative in 1988, bringing total membership at the end of 1988 to 1,483 dailies, representing 95 percent of daily <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> newspaper circulation.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Xinghua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clothing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Factory </ORGANIZATION> has abandoned plans to buy new machines from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> because it does n't have the electricity to run them. `` Without the right connections it would take years to get approval for the extra power,'' said <PERSON> Man </PERSON> <PERSON> Ying </PERSON>, energy manager at the 250-employee factory in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. The factory also ca n't buy air conditioners for the sweltering summers and this past winter went days without heat because of a lack of coal. `` We send out special teams to look for coal,'' she said, adding that they sometimes must pay free market sellers and profiteers up to 130 yuan -LRB- $ 35 -RRB- a ton for it, three times the state-set rate. <PERSON> Xinghua </PERSON> is forced to shut down once a six-day week, every Friday, in the midst of the worst energy crisis in Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s 40-year history. But it is more fortunate than factories in the key industrial cities of <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Shenyang </LOCATION>, which operate only three or four days of their usual six-day week. In parts of <LOCATION> Jiangsu </LOCATION> province, another industrial center near <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, up to a third of the factories were closed and 40 percent of the power plants had stopped working at the end of the year because of coal shortages. In <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, 500 factories employing 100,000 now operate only on night shifts because they have no power during the day. Not only factories are affected. In <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, a city of 10 million people, elevators in high-rise buildings do n't work, new color televisions sit idle and people stock up on candles. The official Guangming Daily noted that even the headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> has been ordered to shut off all electrical appliances every Thursday. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has been losing an average 200 billion yuan -LRB- $ 54 billion -RRB- a year during the 1980s due to power cuts. Last year the losses were believed to be double that as up to one-third of production capacity was unused. The crisis reflects the inability of energy production to match the nation's explosive industrial growth. Industrial output increased by more than 20 percent in 1988, but production of coal, used for 70 percent of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s energy, was up only 4 percent. Energy supplies have also failed to cope with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s new-found prosperity which has resulted in a surge of demand for televisions, refrigerators, microwaves and other electrical appliances. In <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> last year, energy consumption by households jumped 29 percent, while power supply was up by only 3 percent. The Guangming Daily noted that one large luxury hotel in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> today consumes as much energy as all of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> did in the early 1950s. Another problem is that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, although the world's largest producer of coal with 970 million tons last year, ca n't get the power to the places it is needed. Most of the nation's coal is mined in the north, but industry is centered mainly along the southern coast. Half the country's badly overtaxed railway system and a third of river transport is devoted to carrying coal, but that still was n't enough. Last year about 8 million tons, or 3.5 percent of the state coal supply quota, was not delivered. According to a report in the weekly publication Outlook -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Liaowang </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, one large coal mine in <LOCATION> Shanxi </LOCATION> province, in the heart of coal country, had to stop operations temporarily because it lacked fuel to run its bulldozers. Low investment in energy industries, inefficient small mines and artificially low state-set prices for energy have widened the gap between supply and demand. Profiteering by officials with access to coal supplies _ even in the army _ is pandemic. Coal should sell for the state-price equivalent of $ 8 to $ 11 a ton but it goes for $ 54 to $ 80 after passing through the hands of various middlemen on its way to <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>. The government is considering various possible solutions, including more investment in energy production, higher taxes for energy use and higher energy prices, to achieve what appears to be an impossible goal of producing 1.5 billion tons of coal by the year 2000. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> now has no nuclear power but is building two plants along the southern coast and has plans for others. As a stopgap measure, the government is hoping that its harsh austerity campaign begun last fall will slow the economy down enough to relieve the energy crisis. `` If we consider energy to be the lifeblood of modern society,'' the Guangming Daily said, `` today's <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> can be compared to a patient suffering from anemia.''

 When it withdraws from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> will be at peace for the first time since its war for independence began half a century ago against the French, Japanese and eventually the Americans. Reformers now in control hope ending nearly 11 years of occupation will bring better relations with the outside world, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. They believe <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> risks economic disaster without expanded trade and assistance from abroad. Orders for <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s invasion of neighboring <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in December 1978 came from founders of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> made inflexible by the long struggle. Several have resigned or died since, and the reformers pledge to withdraw the remaining occupation forces by Sept. 30. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> says 50,000 of its soldiers remain in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, but foreign intelligence estimates put the number as high as 70,000. A new and bloodier round of civil war between the Hanoi-sponsored Cambodian government and the three-party guerrilla groups opposing it may begin after the withdrawal, but the departure will be a boon to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. Its occupation, aided by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, angered nations on which Vietnamese trade and economic development depend, such as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations: <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s invasion overthrew the brutal <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> regime, which was allied with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> army made a punitive strike into <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> early in 1979. Because of sanctions and its isolation, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> soon found itself in worse shape economically than the devastated country it had occupied. <PERSON> Ngo </PERSON> <PERSON> Dien </PERSON>, Vietnamese ambassador to <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, says relations with <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have improved and trade along the <LOCATION> China-Vietnam </LOCATION> frontier has resumed. `` After the withdrawal, we will see even more changes,'' he added. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> says it will not consider aid or diplomatic relations until Vietnamese military forces leave <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, but <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>'s pledge and its efforts to account for Americans still missing from the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war have caused more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressmen to recommend quicker reconciliation. <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> talks of turning <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION>'s `` battlefields into markets.'' As a condition for a return to normal relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has demanded that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> force <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to leave <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, leaders of the two countries, are to meet next month in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> for the Chinese-Soviet summit in 30 years. Asked whether <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> made its decision under Soviet pressure, <PERSON> Ngo </PERSON> <PERSON> Dien </PERSON> said: `` Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> of course welcomed the withdrawal because he has something in his hands for the summit.'' `` Some people may call it pressure. Some people may call it good coordination between close friends who have the same aim.'' Improving relations with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> might enable the non-communist world to wean it from dependence on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and encourage the limited steps <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> has taken toward a more open, freer society. For three centuries, <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> has found itself shrinking with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s steady territorial expansion. Communist-led Vietnamese guerrillas used Cambodian and Laotian territory as sanctuaries and supply routes for the war against the French and the Americans, and helped communist movements to victory in the two countries. Since economic reformer <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Linh </PERSON> became party chief in late 1986, however, <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> has taken steps to get out of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and has withdrawn troops from <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>. A Soviet diplomat based in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> said privately that some Vietnamese `` saw themselves as the rulers of this country, but luckily the others got the upper hand.'' <PERSON> Uch </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiman </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s political department in the government installed by <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, suggested greater independence for <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> will accompany the end of occupation. `` For the moment, I think we have to stick together because of the political configuration in the region, but I think in the future we do n't want to wall ourselves in,'' he said. `` We certainly want to expand our relations to all neighboring countries, especially the <ORGANIZATION> ASEAN </ORGANIZATION> countries.'' According to the Soviet diplomat, `` <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s influence will remain'' after withdrawal, `` but it will not be monopolistic.'' <ORGANIZATION> Ngo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dien </ORGANIZATION> suggested <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> would stop using military means to resolve problems and would fix its attention on economic development.

<HEAD>Genes May Influence Happiness on Job, Study Suggests</HEAD>

 Genes may influence how satisfied one is at work, according to a study. But the study does not imply that people who dislike their jobs are genetically doomed to unhappiness at work. The apparent impact of genes is quite modest, suggesting `` we're not totally hard-wired'' for job satisfaction, said industrial psychologist <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Arvey </PERSON> Besides, he said, just as nutrition can modify the genetic influence on a person's height, the job setting may affect the hypothesized genetic contribution to job satisfaction. The study suggests that genes may be one reason that some people seem happy no matter what they do, while others have trouble finding a satisfying job, <PERSON> Arvey </PERSON> said. The research is presented in this month's issue of the Journal of Applied Psychology by <PERSON> Arvey </PERSON>, a professor at the Industrial Relations Center of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Carlson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, and colleagues <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON> <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Bouchard </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Segal </PERSON>. <PERSON> Arvey </PERSON> said the study does not prove genetic influence over job satisfaction, but only supports the idea. He also noted that the study was small, and cautioned against applying the results to the general population. Two scientists who have studied genetic influence on personality said the study fits in with previous research. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Loehlin </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> said other research suggests genetic influence on personality and temperament, and an effect on job satisfaction appears plausible. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION> said Finnish studies of twins have found evidence that genes may influence a person's job choice, satisfaction with life, and frequency of changing jobs for such negative reasons as dissatisfaction or being fired. But psychologist <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamin </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Northeastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, who has analyzed nature-versus-nurture research, said Monday he was skeptical. The reason for studying identical twins reared apart is that since twins in a pair share identical genes but grow up in different environments, some similarities between them may reflect genetic influence. But <PERSON> Kamin </PERSON> said previous studies showed twins reared apart tend to grow up in similar family environments, which he said could explain such similarities as degree of job satisfaction. The <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> study focused on 34 pairs of identical twins who had been separated at an average age of less than 6 months. They were not reunited until about age 32, on average. Twenty-five pairs were women. Each twin completed a 20-item questionnaire about satisfaction with the `` major job'' in his or her life. <PERSON> Arvey </PERSON> said the job list was diverse, including research chemist, coal miner, assembly line worker, computer analyst, machinist, nurse and financial planner. Seventeen women said being a housewife was their major job. When researchers analyzed the various levels of general job satisfaction reported by the 68 people, about 30 percent of the differences appeared to be explained by genetic influence. The rest was attributed other factors such as environment. Comparing jobs held by each member of twin pairs, researchers found evidence that twins tended to hold jobs with similar degrees of mental complexity, physical demands and physical coordination requirements. That finding supports the idea that genes also affect what jobs people seek, researchers said. But analysis showed it does not explain the apparent genetic influence on job satisfaction. <PERSON> Arvey </PERSON> said there are several possible ways genes could influence happiness in the workplace. Affecting personality is a `` very likely mechanism,'' he said. Alternatively, he said, genes may influence what people pay attention to in their job environment, such as supervision, or may affect what people want from a job.

 Thousands of grieving friends and relatives of the fallen 47 crewmen from the battleship USS <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> gathered quietly Monday and heard President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> praise their loved ones as `` brothers in eternity.'' `` We join today in mourning for the 47 who perished, and in fact, for the 11 who survived,'' the president told a packed memorial service at <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION>. `` They all were, in the words of a poet, ` the men behind the guns.' `` They came from <LOCATION> Hidalgo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. They came to the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> as strangers, served the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> as shipmates and friends, and left the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> as brothers in eternity. In the finest <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> tradition, they served proudly on a great battleship, the USS Iowa.'' The president, a World War II <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> pilot, said he was proud to recommission the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> in 1984 and said it had earned 11 battle stars in two wars. But with the still-unexplained fire and explosion last Wednesday in the battleship's No. 2 gun turret, he said, `` Fate has written a sorrowful chapter in the history of this great ship.'' The <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s commander, Capt. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON>, said the turret's crew was the best gun crew on the ship, and called its chief _ Chief Gunner's <PERSON> Mate </PERSON> <PERSON> Reginald </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziegler </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gibson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> _ `` my No 1 chief.'' Victims' relatives and hundreds of sailors and officers in dress blues were among the 6,000 people crowded into a hangar for the service. A bouquet of red roses was placed in front of the podium; behind were an American flag and the battleship's banners. Outside, another 2,000 people listened to the service on loudspeakers. As many as 500 <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> crewmen were unable to attend the service because they were delayed by traffic and were not permitted to enter the hangar because of security measures to protect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Many were angry they could not attend, said Machinist's Mate <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Finn </PERSON>, 38. `` It was very important to them,'' <PERSON> Finn </PERSON> said. The service came a day after the World War II-era battleship eased into its home port, its gun barrels scorched and its 1,500 crewmen at the rails in white uniforms and black armbands in memory of their dead shipmates. <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON> told the crowd of mourners that he remembered the men of turret No. 2. `` I remember their faces as they toiled at their guns, sweating an honest sweat that comes from young men dedicated to a great cause,'' he said. `` I remember as they talked among themselves, looking so much like sailors of the past, sharing the exuberance of the times and the dreams of the future,'' he said. `` They were the life, the spirit and the soul of our ship. ... They made the ultimate sacrifice for us. ... The men of Turret Two will be part of the spirit of the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> forever.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> recounted seeing the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> off the coast of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> as a naval aviator in World War II, and the great sense of confidence the big ship lent to the fleet. Addressing the children of the victims, he said: `` You must never forget that your father was <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s pride.'' At the end of the service, while the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hymn </ORGANIZATION> was played, President and Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> greeted and consoled the families of the lost men. After the 45-minute service, the families attended a private reception with <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said 45 victims' families attended the service. At a press briefing following the reception, <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON> praised the hundreds of men who fought the fire for their courage. `` God gave birth to 500 heroes,'' the captain said. `` Fire on a ship is the most terrifying fear ... you have nowhere to run. `` Our extensive training paid off,'' he said. `` Besides the firefighting crews, we had cooks, engineers, deck seamen, <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> all fighting to save the ship.'' <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON> said the blast occurred just as he was turning to Vice Adm. <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, commander of the 2nd Fleet, to tell him to watch the No. 2 turret because it contained his best crew. `` This was my best turret,'' <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON> said. He said turret chief <PERSON> Ziegler </PERSON> `` was the most meticulous of men. He was my No. 1 chief of the 84 chiefs aboard. `` Nobody in that turret did anything unless they were qualified,'' <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON> refused to give a definite answer to reporters' questions about whether the damaged turret could be repaired, saying the battleship could operate without it if necessary All but 11 men in the huge gun turret died almost instantly last Wednesday when the explosion ripped through it. At the time, the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> was conducting open seas gun exercises off <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said the investigation into the blast is continuing. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials have refused to speculate on the cause of the explosion. Cmdr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morse </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s weapons officer, said the guns were thoroughly inspected the morning of the accident, and <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON> said he had no hesitation about the guns' safety. `` I'll be in the turret for the first shot to go off,'' the captain said. One of the survivors, Gunner's Mate 3rd Class <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, said that at first the men down in the powder magazine in the lowest level of the turret did n't know anything was wrong. `` We were waiting for the gun to fire, and we were n't sure,'' he said. When the men discovered that no one was answering the interior turret communications link, <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> ordered the powder returned to the magazine and the compartment evacuated. The sailors found smoke everywhere as they climbed through hatches and up ladders outside the turret toward the sea deck, <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> recalled. `` My first thought was that I'd better get to a lifeboat station, because if the fire got to the magazine things would be bad,'' he said.

 Years of war and defoliation in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> failed to eradicate a small population of the world's rarest rhinoceroses near <LOCATION> Ho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Minh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, wildlife officials say. An American researcher said Monday that he and a team of Vietnamese biologists had found tracks of a population of perhaps 10 to 15 <LOCATION> Javan </LOCATION> rhinoceroses in the eastern part of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s Song Be province. Since the 1960s the rhinos had been thought extinct except for about 50 living on the western tip of Java, said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaller </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, a division of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. `` It was suspected that some still survived in <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION>, but there was no definite evidence of them,'' <PERSON> Schaller </PERSON> said. Live animals were not sighted, but a dead one was found and the animal's tracks left no doubt about their identification, he said. The find is important not only because it improves the survival odds for the <LOCATION> Javan </LOCATION> rhinoceros, but also because the rhinos can be used to encourage preservation of wilderness in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Schaller </PERSON> said. `` You may well say that the rhino is a national treasure of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` But the real treasure is the habitat there, the forest. `` Many of these ... charismatic species are in effect symbols, flagship species, in that they arouse emotions. They motivate a government to protect an area, because they get popular support.'' In <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, as elsewhere in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, rhino horn is used as a constituent of many different medicines, <PERSON> Schaller </PERSON> said. The dark gray Javan rhinoceros is similar to the African black rhinoceros, but is chunkier and has heavy skin folds that give it an armored look. An adult weighs 3,500 pounds, stands 5 -LCB- feet tall and is up to 11 -LCB- feet long. <PERSON> Schaller </PERSON>, who has tracked endangered animals around the globe, most recently in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>, found the rhinos' tracks during an expedition to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in February and March. He was there with <PERSON> Vo </PERSON> <PERSON> Thanh </PERSON> <PERSON> Son </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanoi </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Yuan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dang </PERSON> and <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinh </PERSON> <PERSON> Thuy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s national research council to make the first wildlife survey of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s southern forests. The tracks were found along the <LOCATION> Dong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, 75 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Ho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Minh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, formerly <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION>. The region where the rhinos were found is a hot, humid patchwork of forest, native tribesmen's fields and huge expanses of bamboo up to 40 feet tall. `` The Vietnamese are real conscious of conservation, and I think they'll make an effort'' to protect the rhinos, <PERSON> Schaller </PERSON> said. He recommends stiff penalties for killing and selling rhinos, and the enlargement of a wilderness reserve near where the rhinoceroses were found.

 A DC-9 jet carrying 55 passengers was forced to turn around minutes after takeoff when the pilot discovered flames shooting from an engine. The <ORGANIZATION> Midway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> twin-engine jet landed safely at <LOCATION> Midway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> on the city's southwest side with no injuries, said <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the airline.

Ms. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said a compressor, which mixes air and fuel, failed and the fuel ignited as it was discharged out of the rear of the engine. She compared it to a car backfiring _ `` a big backfire from a big engine.'' `` I'm sure the passengers heard a loud bang and the pilot noticed a loss of power in the engine,'' Ms. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said Emergency vehicles were summoned as the plane returned using only one engine.

<HEAD>Chairman Wants to Eliminate New York's Board of Estimate, Expand
Council</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ALAN HARPER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The head of a commission appointed to rework the city's unconstitutional government proposed eliminating the powerful <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estimate </ORGANIZATION> on Monday and expanding the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to 50 members. The mayor would take control of contracts _ a lightning rod in view of the city corruption scandals surrounding Board of Estimate-awarded contracts that have resulted in criminal convictions. However, various bodies would have oversight responsibilities. Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> and City Comptroller <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldin </PERSON> were generally pleased by the proposals made by <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> A.O </PERSON>. <PERSON> Schwarz </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Charter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The five borough presidents who sit on the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estimate </ORGANIZATION> opposed them, however, with <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Golden </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> saying <PERSON> Schwarz </PERSON> `` is telling the boroughs to drop dead.'' At a public hearing, <PERSON> Schwarz </PERSON> also put forth the idea of a bicameral legislature, but not as a formal proposal. He said a new, 19-member house would be the equal of the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, but that it would only work if it gave greater representation to blacks and Hispanics. The commission was created by the mayor to look into ways city government could restructure itself as court challenges to the Board of Estimate made their way through the legal system. In March, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled that the board was unconstitutional because it violated the one-person, one-vote doctrine by giving each borough equal weight even though they varied widely in population. The commission, which had been on hold pending the court's ruling, then went into high gear with a self-imposed mandate to get its proposals on the November ballot The chairman's proposals are the first formal agenda around which the 15-member commission can debate. <PERSON> Schwarz </PERSON> presented part of the proposals Monday for discussion with the rest to be reviewed by the commission Tuesday. His proposals are not final. Under his proposals, the powers of the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estimate </ORGANIZATION>, made up of the borough presidents, the mayor, the city council president and the comptroller, would be dispersed. The comptroller no longer would be involved in policy and would be limited to fiscal matters and oversight and audit functions on contracts. `` I think it is a useful focus for reconstituting the city government,'' Comptroller <PERSON> Goldin </PERSON> said. `` The comptroller's role has always been overwhelmingly fiscal. This recognizes that reality.'' The <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> would expand from 35 to 50 members, with the districts to correspond as closely as possible to community board districts. The city council president would continue as an ombudsman.

 <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> slapped <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cagney </PERSON> and <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>, shook <PERSON> Miriam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>, yelled at several leading men and shot one. And between these film clips shown at a <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> tribute on Monday night, several people who worked with <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> praised her for her artistry and versatility. `` Working with <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> was as happy and rewarding as any experience I've ever had. Barring grand opera I ca n't think of anything beyond her range,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mankiewicz </PERSON>, who wrote and directed the 1950 movie `` All About Eve.'' <PERSON> Ann-Margret </PERSON>, <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> also spoke in honor of Miss <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> during the program at <PERSON> Avery </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>. The actress herself, who spoke last, proved that she still has verve and the ability to respond to the moment. `` I had hoped one day someone would, on one of my award evenings,'' she began, and was interrupted by laughter. `` Are you laughing, thinking I'm bragging?'' she asked, then continued, `` would show not only clips from my most well-known films but would include scenes from my earliest films.'' That was done, as a scene from the first of Miss <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' more than 80 movies was shown. In the brief clip from 1931's `` Bad Sister,'' <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagel </PERSON> came in while Miss <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> was powdering a modestly diapered baby, kissed her and exited. Two of the speakers mentioned being warned by others that <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> could be selfish. <PERSON> Mankiewicz </PERSON> said other writers and directors predicted he and the star would have a disastrous head-on collision. `` Directors said, ` She will rewrite and she, not you, will direct.''' They were wrong, <PERSON> Mankiewicz </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON>, who appeared with <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> in `` Dark Victory'' in 1939, said she'd been given advice by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> theater friends. `` They said, ` She'll turn you around so the camera can only see your ear. If the set has a lot of furniture, try holding onto something.' `` For the first two or three days I tried to do that. I found she was always sure I was properly lighted; she was wonderfully kind and thoughtful, so I stopped. Afrerwards she said she thought they'd got somebody who was raving mad. We became good friends and stayed that way.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> acted with <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> once, in `` Right of Way,'' made for TV in 1983. `` I jumped at the chance,'' <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said. `` From the first day, it felt just great to be there with <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> on the set and watch the way this wonderful actress works. I consider myself very fortunate to have worked with this woman I love and admire. It means a lot to me to be here tonight.'' <PERSON> Ann-Margret </PERSON>'s first film role, at age 18, was as <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' daughter in the 1961 `` Pocketful of Miracles. <PERSON> Ann-Margret </PERSON> said, `` Miss <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> was so kind and so caring. `` Nobody has matched her intelligence and incredible energy. There's nothing like watching her entering a scene with her eyes blazing, ready to stand up for herself or cut somebody else down to size.''

<HEAD>Police To Investigate Palestinian Press Cards</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police Minister <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bar-Lev </PERSON> says he has ordered an investigation into press cards Palestinians are issuing foreign journalists for the occupied lands, where <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> police have posed as reporters. Many foreign reporters have acquired such cards since a scandal last month involving two police officers who were filmed using a `` Press'' sign on their vehicle during a raid against Arab rioters in east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Police later imposed limitations on the practice, but did not rule it out altogether, saying it was a legitimate decoy method in dealing with the 16-month Palestinian uprising. In addition, Jewish settlers living in the occupied lands have sometimes used `` Press'' signs to pass unharmed through Palestinian roadblocks where stone-throwers hurl rocks at cars with the yellow Israeli license plates. Palestinians have alleged that <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> secret service agents were also presenting themselves as journalists. Masked Palestinian activists have often stopped reporters to check their credentials. <PERSON> Bar-Lev </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio Monday that police would look into the Palestinian-issued press cards. `` Those issuing these cards are an organization in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` We will check if it's against the law, and what law, and what steps can we take against people issuing these cards.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Slater </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said foreign journalists had to use the Palestinian cards because <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> security officials had posed as journalists. `` After police were posing as journalists, the Palestinians saw the Israeli press cards as identifying either a real journalist or a police agent,'' he said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. `` I can understand that the Palestinians want to make our work easier and give us their cards.'' `` It gives them some possibility to check if the man is really a reporter and we accept it, it makes it easier for us,'' said <PERSON> Slater </PERSON>, whose organization represents 200 to 300 foreign journalists posted in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` If a reporter has to get a card from some element, it's not a violation of some norm but a natural thing in every conflict in the world ... in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' he added. But <PERSON> Yoram </PERSON> <PERSON> Ettinger </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, said that `` the very acceptance of a Palestinian card in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, I think, is a challenge to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s sovereignty.'' `` As far as I know the card has a map of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> river to the sea which means the elimination of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' he said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. Neither <PERSON> Slater </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Ettinger </PERSON> identified the organization that produces the press cards. The Israeli news agency <ORGANIZATION> Itim </ORGANIZATION> said it was a Jerusalem-based organization called `` Palestinian Press Office.'' <PERSON> Radwan </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayyash </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journalists </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> based in east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, said his office has been issuing cards for foreign journalists for the last two years. There is no map on these cards. `` The cards are not a challenge to anybody and have no political significance whatsoever,'' <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayyash </PERSON> said. `` It has nothing to do with the uprising or an independent Palestinian state. Moreover, our association has a license from the Israeli <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>.'' He said the cards were issued upon request by foreign reporters who `` told us, we are harmed by your people, would you do something to help us and we did.''

 Ambassador <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON>'s pinstripe pants are wearing a little thin these days He will miss his prime minister's arrival from <LOCATION> Dominica </LOCATION> this weekend because he'll be flying to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, where he doubles as ambassador to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. Not to worry, says <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON>, puffing contentedly on his pipe. He will leave the welcoming ceremonies to the capable hands of his local embassy staff _ his wife, <PERSON> Angela </PERSON>, and their 25-year-old son, <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> is the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> diplomatic representative of the 86,000 people of <LOCATION> Dominica </LOCATION> -LRB- pronounced <LOCATION> Dom-i-NEE-ca </LOCATION> -RRB-, a mountainous, lushly forested island nestled between the French islands of <LOCATION> Guadeloupe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Martinique </LOCATION> in the eastern <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> His embassy, the smallest in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, occupies the <ORGANIZATION> Benjamins </ORGANIZATION>' eighth-floor apartment in a high-rise condominium overlooking suburban <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION> His wife says they have `` the best view of any embassy in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.'' The embassy's only official decoration is the <LOCATION> Dominica </LOCATION> national flag, mounted on a six-foot pole in the foyer. <LOCATION> Dominica </LOCATION> is too poor to furnish <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> with a chauffeur-driven limousine, so he drives to his diplomatic appointments in the family's 1987 <LOCATION> Plymouth </LOCATION> sedan. When the ambassador invites guests to an embassy dinner party, his German-born wife dons an apron and prepares the food. `` I am what you call a gourmet cook,'' says Mrs. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON>. `` I love to do my own cooking.'' <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON>, 65, a retired economist and official of the International Fund for Agricultural and <ORGANIZATION> Rural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> agency, has served without pay as <LOCATION> Dominica </LOCATION>'s ambassador to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and the Food and <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> since 1986. He gets an annual $ 25,000 expense account to cover the costs of telephone calls, correspondence and his shuttle flights between <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, where he spends eight months a year. While he's away, Mrs. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> handles routine embassy affairs, and their son steps in when they're both traveling. `` We get up early and get our work done like any other embassy,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> says. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> and his wife are staunchly proud of their country, which gained its independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1978, and their beloved leader, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Eugenia </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, first female prime minister of the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. She arrives Sunday for three days of meetings with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, legislators and a private group seeking to raise $ 600,000 to rebuild <LOCATION> Dominica </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> building, which was destroyed by fire in 1979. `` <LOCATION> Dominica </LOCATION> is one of the most unspoiled and physically one of the most beautiful countries in the world,'' <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> said in a recent interview. The island, 29 miles long and 15 miles wide, contains vast rain forests, volcanic peaks, waterfalls, hot springs, a cratered `` boiling lake'' and 365 rivers _ one for each day of the year. It is the home of the world's only Sisserou parrots and the only full-blooded Carib Indians, and the waters off its southwestern coast are considered a scuba diver's paradise. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> also praises his country's 95 percent literacy rate, a new highway network, the doubling of <LOCATION> Dominica </LOCATION>'s production of bananas _ its main export _ an excellent debt-payment record and plans to build an international airport to spur tourist traffic. The ambassador reminds people that he represents the Commonwealth of <LOCATION> Dominica </LOCATION>, not the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, even though his embassy receives phone calls and mail _ some of it top secret _ for the other, much larger <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> nation. Says Benjamin: `` Whenever I see the ambassador from the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, I say, ` Would n't it be a good idea for us to merge our two embassies? Then we could share our secrets fully'.''

 Police in the southern city of <LOCATION> Changsha </LOCATION> arrested 98 people, just six of them students, for looting that occurred during a student demonstration last weekend, an official newspaper reported today. The People's Daily said those arrested were caught looting 28 shops and a shopping arcade Saturday in what the official press described as the worst rioting in 40 years of Communist rule. Rioting also broke out Saturday in the ancient capital of <LOCATION> Xian </LOCATION>, with crowds throwing rocks and setting fire to buildings and vehicles.

In <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on Saturday, 150,000 students congregated on Tiananmen Square in the center of the city for a peaceful demonstration. Student leaders in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> have made efforts to keep unemployed youth and other potential troublemakers out of their ranks. Most of the other demonstrations have also been peaceful, although foreign sources said students at the <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hefei </LOCATION>, eastern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, last week smashed windows and furniture in a campus cafeteria.

 The ethics case against <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> dominates <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> conversation, but lawmakers found out over the weekend that folks back home have other things on their minds. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s chief accuser, Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, R-Ga., used town meetings in his suburban <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> district to cite repeatedly from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee report charging <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> with 69 violations That was fine, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Norton </PERSON>, a Douglas county real estate broker. But he was more concerned over sewage and other pollution in the <LOCATION> Chattahoochee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. `` I'd be more enthusiastic about <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> if he'd get as much impact on the environment and our rivers as he did on <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>,'' he said. Politicians found reactions like that were commonplace last weekend in their first trips home since the ethics committee announced it had reason to believe <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> had violated House rules. The panel, formally known as the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, issued its equivalent of an indictment of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. It will decide later whether to report actual violations to the full House for disciplinary action. The charges center on allegations that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> used a sweetheart publishing deal and bulk book sales to evade House limits on outside income, and that he accepted gifts from a friend who had an interest in legislation. The committee is continuing to investigate an oil well deal that netted a big profit for the speaker even though the well was a dud. And as a grassroots political topic, many lawmakers are finding the <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> case is a dud, too. Rep. <PERSON> Jolene </PERSON> <PERSON> Unsoeld </PERSON>, D-Wash., said only newspaper reporters asked her about <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> during her district visit The freshman congresswoman handled questions from voters on topics including trade, fishing and forestry. Apparently her tastes mirror her constituents' _ she said she repeatedly fell asleep when she tried to read the ethics panel volume. Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass., who has made several television appearances on the <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> case to take on the speaker's accuser, received only a single question on the topic at a <ORGANIZATION> Wellesley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> forum _ and that was from a professor <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Barstow </PERSON>, a professor of theater studies, said he was concerned the <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> case would lead to a `` general perception of corruption'' among the Democrats. Political science major <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenkrantz </PERSON>, a senior who helped organize <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s appearance at the school, said the <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> case was less important to her than issues such as abortion and the federal budget. `` It does n't affect me personally,'' she said. In <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s home district, people probably do take his performance more personally. There, 79 percent gave him a job rating of good to outstanding, according to a poll conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegram </ORGANIZATION> in the days following the ethics committee report. Nationwide polls released today showed <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> to be far from a front-burner issue. A <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll found more than half the people responding were ignorant of the charges. A <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> poll found that only a third said they were closely following news about <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, and less than 40 percent knew his party. However, the same polls showed a strong majority _ 77 percent in the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> survey _ believed he should resign if the charges against him are found to be true. `` My reaction is to wait on any direct verdict until all the evidence is in,'' said <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Lakian </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> student who heard a speech there by <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>. `` I would hope the public would give <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> his day in court.'' `` He's guilty as hell'' was the early line from <PERSON> Galen </PERSON> <PERSON> Rottinghaus </PERSON>, a farmer in Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Slattery </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> district. But a <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reporter who spent two days with <PERSON> Slattery </PERSON> found that the congressman only received a Wright question at about every other meeting. <PERSON> Slattery </PERSON> says when the issue comes before the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, he wants to judge <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> on the facts and not on public opinion. But, he acknowledged, `` if the speaker loses the battle of public opinion ... that will significantly weaken his political position back home.''

<HEAD>Safety Board Looking At California Air Traffic Control Operation</HEAD>

 A <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> staff report recommends several changes in air traffic control operations over southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> as a result of incidents of airplanes flying too close together, a board source says. The board was taking up the report at its public meeting today after its investigation into the `` loss of standard separation'' between a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet and an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jetliner on Feb. 13 over <LOCATION> Westminster </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The report recommends increases in staff and training at the Coast Terminal Radar Approach Control Facility in <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, some improvements and expansion of the facility itself and several technical changes, the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The investigation of the British Airways-American incident was expanded to cover seven other operational errors over the past year at the facility just south of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The traffic control operation handles about half a million flights a year in the skies between <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, which is one of the busiest flight areas in the country outside major airport control zones. The board meeting on <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> air traffic control problems comes two days after two reports of airliners nearly colliding in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> area. A <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet coming in from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and a commuter plane flew about 100 feet apart as they approached <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday, and 45 minutes later a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 en route from <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> reported coming within 400 yards of a small <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> plane near <LOCATION> Westchester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. The two jetliners in the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> incident flew within 1.9 miles of each other, both at 9,000 feet, and <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> officials at the time said the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> pilot had to make a hasty turn to avoid a collision. Although the planes were not close enough for the incident to be considered a `` near miss,'' <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> rules say they should have been at least three miles apart horizontally and 1,000 feet vertically. The British <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 was carrying 286 people from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> plane, a British Aerospace 146 with 70 people aboard, was landing at <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> after being diverted from <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> airport, whose runway had been closed due to a power failure. The board inquiry is its first major investigation into an air traffic control operation since the board began recommending upgrading at <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s O ` Hare International Airport after operational errors increased in 1986. O'Hare had more than 30 flight-handling errors in 1988, and the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> has ordered several changes, including the hiring of additional controllers.

<HEAD>Postal Service Does its Part to Stamp out Drugs</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 If you're waiting for a mail delivery of illegal drugs, beware the postman. He may be delivering your arrest warrant. With President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> placing a high priority on eliminating the `` scourge of drugs,'' even the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is getting into the act. The service is making arrests on narcotics distribution charges at more than twice the rate of last year, says Inspector <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON>. `` In fiscal 1988, we arrested 425 people for distributing narcotics through the mail,'' <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> said. `` In the first six months of this fiscal year, we have arrested 440 people.'' Among their recent finds were $ 8,000 worth of PCP packed in baby food jars and mailed from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to Broken Arrow, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, and illicit steroids being distributed by two men in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> who were arrested April 17. Officials said that case, the result of a two-year investigation by postal inspectors and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, was the largest illicit steroid ring ever busted. There are 1,800 postal inspectors, of whom 800 do criminal investigations including mail fraud, child pornography and internal theft, <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> said. About 50 are assigned to focus on drugs, but when a case comes along, `` We draw on all the other people in the office. ... We'll even bring them from across the country if the magnitude of the case calls for that. Unlike many agencies that announce their seizures and annual haul of illegal drugs with great fanfare, the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has remained relatively low key. A question about exactly how many seizures were made and how much in illegal drugs was seized nationwide in the last fiscal year, for example, was a stumper. `` Well, we've had 440 arrests this year, but we may have had more seizures such as something being sent to a P.O. box and no one ever picking it up,'' <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> said. He noted that the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which for the most part works off tips provided by other agencies, generally does n't make large seizures compared with other agencies due to the nature of the mails `` In a boat or a container ship or an airliner, they can move tons in those kind of things,'' he said. `` In the mail you ca n't do that, at least not in an individual package.'' Often, the mailing of narcotics is not for distribution, just for the personal use of the recipient, he said. Private mail services such as <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parcel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> are not under the same scrutiny as the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mail. Spokesmen for both companies said they cooperate with federal and local authorities on drug investigations, but neither would indicate exactly how often this has occurred or whether they instigated any of the probes. The <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is cooperating with the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> on a program in which mail from 29 high-risk drug source countries is cleared at the port of arrival, according to <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Shimkoski </PERSON> of Customs. `` This will prevent ground transfers to inland destinations, eliminates potention monkey business,'' he said. Already, Customs has seized record quantities of drugs at 21 international mail branches. In fiscal 1988, Customs seized 164 pounds of heroin, 1,600 pounds of opium and 1,310 pounds of marijuana. There were no significant amounts of cocaine mailed, <PERSON> Shimkoski </PERSON> said. In the first half of fiscal 1989, <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> seized 65 pounds of heroin, 216 pounds of opium, 10 pounds of cocaine and 297 pounds of marijuana at the mail branches. He said the numbers may appear to be low compared with the previous year `` but there tends to be a pickup when you get into the warmer months.''

 In one minute, <PERSON> Cam </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> had to prepare a speech on poets and cheese. He did n't fret and at a national forensics competition he delivered a six-minute talk so lyrical that he won in his category. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> was one of about 1,000 students from 129 colleges and universities in 35 states who competed in the 19th <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forensic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Individual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Events </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tournament </ORGANIZATION>. The five-day competition ended Monday with finals in the nine events _ after-dinner speaking, prose, poetry, informative, persuasive, rhetorical criticism, impromptu, extemporaneous and dual drama interpretation. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> student, won the impromptu category and the pentathlon award for his scoring in at least five events. His impromptu speech was on the quote, `` Poets are mysteriously silent about cheese.'' He said that he thought the author, <LOCATION> G.K. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chesterson </LOCATION>, meant poets have trouble explaining the concrete and mundane aspects of life. Then he disagreed with <PERSON> Chesterson </PERSON>. A tricky assignment, but one that <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said will serve him well next year as a law student at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's a really good preparation for law school because it's the kind of thing that prepares you to interact with people,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. `` We have to persuade to win. It's not enough to just seem impressive.'' An after-dinner speech on the fear of homosexuals helped <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Sculley </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Bradley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> win a national forensics title while teammate <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Braun </PERSON> won two events _ poetry and dual drama with <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Farruggio </PERSON>. The Illinois university took home the sweepstakes award for most points accumulated by a school, its fourth such title in six years. Other winners were <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin-Madison </ORGANIZATION>, rhetorical criticism; <PERSON> Joey </PERSON> <PERSON> Callow </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION>, informative; <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Andanto </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, prose; <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakoby </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, extemporaneous; and <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Heffernan </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin-Madison </ORGANIZATION>, persuasion. `` Despite the pressures on university budgets, forensics is something strong. ... This is a way a university shows off what it does in the classroom,'' said tournament director <PERSON> Christina </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin-Eau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Claire </ORGANIZATION>. Well-known personalities who have competed in forensics include President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, television talk-show host <PERSON> Oprah </PERSON> <PERSON> Winfrey </PERSON> and actress <PERSON> Shelley </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, according to tournament literature. The audience sitting on folding chairs in the <ORGANIZATION> Upsala </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> gymnasium Monday laughed loudly at the 10-minute, after-dinner speeches of six finalists. <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Gering </PERSON>, a senior speech communications major from <ORGANIZATION> Mankato </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, said she enjoyed the competition because `` you get a chance to perform.'' The 22-year-old's after-dinner performance charmed some. `` I represent the non-conformists of the world,'' Ms. <PERSON> Gering </PERSON> told the audience. `` I do n't do lunch. I eat my food, thank you.''

<HEAD>St Paddy's Surprise: Three Mile Island Siren Jolted Residents</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> wants to know why a warning siren blared for 50 minutes near the <LOCATION> Three </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> nuclear plant on St. Patrick's Day, frightening residents enough that some began to pack their belongings. The siren was heard by residents of <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, late in the evening of March 17 _ 11 days before the 10th anniversary of the nation's worst commercial accident at the plant. During the accident, pregnant women and preschoolers had been advised to evacuate within five miles of the two reactors. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> said he, his wife and two children thought it was an `` odd time for a test'' when they were awakened by the siren last month at 11:20 p.m. It lasted until 12:10 a.m., and the couple said they could get no information from neighbors, television and radio stations, or the police on the reason why. `` Unless you were involved, you can not realize the anxiety and concern for the health of your family while the siren was sounding, nor can you share my anger at not being able to find out what was happening,'' <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> said in a March 23 letter to the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Reactor Safeguards. `` Those 50 minutes seemed like hours to me, my family and our neighbors,'' he said. `` Some of the neighbors began to pack up and leave the area. Even after the siren stopped, we had no idea if there was a problem.'' The advisory panel said it considered <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON>'s letter serious enough to warrant an investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> staff and GPU Nuclear, the plant operator. `` Events of the type described in Mr. <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON>'s letter reflect poorly on the industry's emergency planning efforts,'' <PERSON> Forrest </PERSON> <PERSON> Remick </PERSON>, chairman of the advisory panel, said in a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> on April 13. Three Mile Island officials are not sure why the alarm was sounded. The sirens are maintained by the utility, but are also used by <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> officials for other local emergencies not related to the plant. Once it began, the siren is supposed to be able to be shut off by remote control. But when that failed on March 17, the utility had to call a contractor to drive to the site and shut it off by hand, according to <ORGANIZATION> GPU </ORGANIZATION> Nuclear spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>. `` Fifty minutes when you're listening in the middle of the night is a long time,'' <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> said. `` When you're us and you have to find out what the problem is, it's not that long. I'm sure it was for him -LRB- <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> -RRB-.'' The most frustrating thing, <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> said Monday in a telephone interview, is that he and his neighbors followed emergency procedures by tuning to designated television and radio stations _ but still could get no information. An <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> official looking into the incident recently told <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON>'s wife that information was indeed available from one radio station `` but I guess we do n't listen to them,'' he said

 Government will have to curtail domestic farm production if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> falls behind in world agriculture markets, says the dean of agriculture at <ORGANIZATION> Purdue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` If we're not competitive, we're talking about downsizing agriculture,'' Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Monday. International trade has arisen as one of the most important considerations for lawmakers working on the 1990 farm bill, which will decide government policies for years to come. <PERSON> J.B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Sparks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodities </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, told the committee that technology, which was the issue of previous decades, has successfully increased farm production. Future domestic demand will grow only slightly, creating a need to pursue foreign markets, he said. Former agriculture secretary <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergland </PERSON>, who now heads the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said farm yields are increasing all over the world, making other countries less dependent on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We're not the lowest cost producer,'' <PERSON> Bergland </PERSON> said. He said <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> produces soybeans cheaper than the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> is the world's most efficient dairy producer. Lawmakers are also looking into the Export Enhancement Program, which provides subsidies for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm exports to make them less expensive abroad. On Monday, at a conference for agriculture reporters, Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON>, D-Kan., said he believes the the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> has put <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> on hold He said <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> has refused to give its consent to any new sales under the program since the end of February. <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON>, who chairs the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> soybean and wheat subcommittee, said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> defended the importance of the export subsidy program during his campaign and Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> also has supported it. The <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> appears to be in conflict with the rest of the administration, the congressman said. The <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> has scheduled a meeting to review the program, but denies that it has suspended it. Last week, Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON>, D-Neb., raised the same concern voiced by <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON> and sent a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> saying there should be no further delays in EEP sales A spokesman for <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON>'s office said Monday the budget office had not responded. Both <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON> said the Export Enhancement Program is essential to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> strength at trade talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> where American negotiators are trying to get countries around the world to remove or reduce subsidies on agricultural products.

<HEAD>Court to Rule on Federal Judge's Authority to Impose Tax</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> will decide whether a federal judge may order local taxes to be raised in order to pay for racially balanced schools, in the first desegregation case the court has heard for years. The justices announced on Monday they will rule on tax increases ordered by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. The increases are designed to raise hundreds of millions of dollars to improve decaying, predominantly black schools in the city. The last time the court heard arguments and ruled on desegregation efforts was in 1982, in cases from <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. In the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> case, the court will hear an appeal by state officials that <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> exceeded his authority. The city's schools were segregated by <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> state law until 1954. From 1954 to 1984 the percentage of black students in the city climbed from 22.5 to 67.7 percent. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> ruled in 1987 that the school facilities had `` literally rotted'' and ordered them upgraded. The 8th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld most of <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>'s ruling last August The appeals court said, `` There are still vestiges of the dual school system lingering in the -LRB- city school district -RRB-, and the district and the state have not met their obligations to disestablish that system.'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> ordered creation of so-called magnet schools, providing that by the 1991-92 school year every high school and middle school in the city, and about half the elementary schools, will offer distinctive areas of concentration such as foreign languages, performing arts or math and science. The judge also called for capital improvements costing some $ 260 million to be completed by the fall of 1990. To enable the city school district to pay its share of the desegregation plan's costs, the judge imposed a 1.5 percent income tax surcharge and raised school district property taxes to $ 4 per $ 100 assessed valuation through the 1991-92 fiscal year. State officials said the $ 4 per $ 100 levy represented a doubling of the local property tax. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> ordered the tax increases because no money was available to finance the construction of new schools. Between 1970 and 1983, school district voters had turned down six proposals to increase taxes for education. He also authorized the school district to issue $ 150 million in 20-year capital improvement bonds.

 Some officials in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration say public confidence in the nation's food system needs a lift. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, White House special assistant for agricultural affairs, says a new interagency task force has been formed to `` examine our policies in this whole area'' of food safety and make recommendations for changes, if any are needed. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> congressman from <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, told a meeting of farm journalists on Monday that the task force includes representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're going to take a good look at what we're doing now and what we might -LRB- be doing -RRB- in the future to increase public confidence and to ensure that our programs ... remain the best,'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. Speaking earlier to the same group, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journalists </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said that sensationalism and misleading news stories about food safety can hurt consumers when accurate information is needed most. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> cited recent cases involving potential food supply hazards. One of those was about chemicals such as Alar used in apple production. A recent study by a private environmental group, the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, suggested that children may be exposed to dangerous levels of carcinogenic chemicals in fruits and vegetables because they eat large amounts in proportion to their weight. The council's study singled out Alar, and alarms were raised throughout the country about the possible hazards of eating apples. Government regulatory agencies, including the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said there was no need to panic and that there was no reason for parents to keep apples from children. `` We need to make sure that these volatile issues are handled as well as possible from a communications standpoint,'' he said. `` Obviously, we have freedom of the press in this country, and the media can do what it wishes in this area _ just as it does in other areas.'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> added: `` And if folks choose to provide coverage for misleading research studies or choose to distort or sensationalize, they're privileged to do so, that's the price we pay for a democratic society.'' In the meantime, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said he hoped `` we can do an effective job of keeping these issues in proper balance.'' One reporter asked what <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> meant by `` proper balance'' in news reports. `` That means making sure that the facts are out, and not simply someone's distorted interpretation of what they read, see or hear,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which sometimes in the past has been accused of sticking up for farm interests at the expense of consumers and environmentalists, needs to have a spotless reputation on such sensitive issues, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said. `` We're going to play it straight in the department in these areas, and I hope we can establish a reputation for credibility on all fronts,'' he said. `` If we say something about an Alar stituation, or we say something about any other food safety question, my intent is that we do it in such a way that it will command the respect of everyone who views that issue or evaluates it in any way.'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said he wants <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> `` to have the respect'' of both sides of an issue. In the case of Alar and the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resource </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s report which triggered the apple scare, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said that `` great attention in the media was given to a study that had not been subjected to peer review. He said the study had been superseded by other research, which had been subjected to review. `` None of that seemed to emerge in the media treatment of that issue in its initial stages,'' and the result, he said, was `` sensationalism and a distortion of the facts.''

<TEXT>
 A rising price for the yen and an increase in wages have driven the cost of labor in Japanese industry to 95 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cost last year, when reckoned in dollars, according to the latest figures from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>. The average cost per hour was $ 13.90 in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and $ 13.14 in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Low wages in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> were often cited in the past as a reason for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s ability to sell its goods. In dollar terms, the average cost of a worker was only half the cost in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as recently as 1985. Since then, the price of the yen has risen fast: it took 238 yen to buy a dollar in 1985; last year the average price was only 128 yen. Costs are put in dollar terms so that they can be compared from one country to the next. When the dollar cost of a country's goods goes up, as <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s cost has done, its goods become more expensive and _ in theory at least _ harder to sell on world markets compared with the goods of its competitors. `` The dollar cost is the only one that people use when figuring how competitive a country is,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>, professor of economics at <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said in an interview Monday. In practice, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> still sold $ 77 billion worth of goods last year beyond what it bought. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had the opposite situation, a trade deficit of more than $ 152 billion. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Evans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, who makes weekly worldwide forecasts from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, cited other figures from the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to show that Japanese labor cost in the auto industry as still only 75 percent of the cost in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He saw that as a major reason for continued high <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imports and low exports. `` It is almost certain that the 1989 figures will show a further deterioration in our trade deficit,'' he wrote in a comment on the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> figures. The amounts Japanese employers pay for labor have been steadily increasing in Japanese terms as well, from an average of 904 yen an hour in 1975, then equal to only $ 3.05, to 1,685 yen last year or $ 13.14. This translates into even greater purchasing power for Japanese wage-earners, since Japanese price rises have been smaller than in any other big industrial country. Writers have been pointing out recently that these increases still leave the standard of living low for many Japanese, compared with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and West European countries. In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> labor costs were 30 percent to 40 percent higher last year than in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. They were 10 percent to 20 percent higher in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. `` That should mean more exports and fewer imports for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, though the dollar has been going up again this year,'' said Art Nees, in charge of international comparisons at the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>. `` But it takes time for the effects to show.''

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has rejected a plea by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to hold negotiations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on reducing battlefield nuclear missiles and instead will proceed with work to improve the weapons. The dispute, which is causing strains within the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance, was aired for nearly four hours Monday by high-level West German and American delegations. West German Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> and Defense Minister <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> then headed back to <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> to bring the bad news to Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s political future could be clouded by failure to persuade the Americans to open negotiations with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on the U.S.-built Lance missiles. The West German electorate is turning more toward disarmament, and the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION> are gaining ground in the polls against <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s own <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>. Local elections are being held in June. Before leaving for <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, however, <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> told German reporters the talks were `` encouraging.'' They did not elaborate. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s formal presentation will be made in his governmental declaration to the West German parliament on Thursday. Among the Americans at the meeting Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, Secretary of Defense <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, the president's assistant for national security affairs. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> made it clear before the meeting that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would oppose reducing short-range nuclear missile strength while the Soviets hold an advantage in non-nuclear forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said through a spokeswoman he understood `` the Federal Republic's problem regarding the timing of any such decision'' to modernize. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> also was seeking a delay in plans to extend the range of the Lance missiles. The meeting was hastily arranged Friday, when <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> called <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Unless the issue is resolved, it could disrupt the summit meeting <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will attend at the end of May with the leaders of the 15 other <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> countries in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s domestic concerns conflict with the determined drive by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> to keep the Lances on West German soil. <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> gave no indication as they left the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> whether they had made any headway. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> issued a brief statement that described the meeting as `` useful and friendly.'' He said the discussions would be continued `` in an effort to reach an agreement within the alliance.'' `` Secretary <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> has said many times that it would be preferable if we could move to modernize our short-range nuclear weapons, although we understand the Federal Republic's problem regarding the timing of any such decision,'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said as the parties met. `` And he has said that we think it would be a mistake to engage in arms control negotiations on SNF -LRB- Short-range Nuclear Forces -RRB-.'' <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION>, speaking at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> before the meeting, said negotiating at this point with the Soviets over the missiles would be a mistake because of their overwhelming superiority in non-nuclear forces. `` For the foreseeable future, certainly as long as there is overwhelming Soviet conventional superiority,'' the <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary said, `` there's absolutely no rationale at all for us to talk about eliminating or significantly reducing those short-range forces.'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would proceed with `` early work'' to improve the Lance missile system. `` It does not require a firm commitment, now, or a specific decision, now, by a specific government,'' he said. Opponents of the missiles are concerned that having an arsenal of Lances is an incentive to use them, and that any nuclear conflict between East and West would spread to a world-threatening war. British Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> will fly to <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> on Sunday to try to persuade <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> to suspend his campaign for U.S.-Soviet negotiations on the issue. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> has support among several of the smaller <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> countries, including <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>.

 Carriage drivers are raising a stink over a city plan to clean up the streets by putting horses in diapers. `` The people proposing this do n't know one end of a horse from the other,'' said driver <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Nugent </PERSON>. Sitting behind a gray beauty named <PERSON> Rover </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nugent </PERSON> was one of more than 30 drivers who rode their carriages Monday to a hearing to protest the plan. Drivers say the diapers _ reusable vinyl sacks strapped to a horse's rear _ leak, smell bad, attract flies and bees and can cause sores and infections. They also say all mares would have to be replaced because their anatomy can not tolerate the diapers. `` We feel it's inhumane,'' said carriage owner <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Grill </PERSON>, who testified at the hearing while drivers chanted `` Clean up crime, not horse manure.'' The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Horse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carriage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> pays $ 2,000 a month to a private sanitation service to remove manure from Central Park's carriage routes. Grill said drivers would be willing to pay to double the cleanup effort if the city dropped the diaper idea. Dr. <PERSON> Fay </PERSON> <PERSON> Smimmo </PERSON>, a veterinarian consulting for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recreation </ORGANIZATION>, said the diapers should n't bother horses if adjusted properly. Many of the diapers are made by Amish communities where horses are used everyday, she said, and special models are available for mares. <PERSON> Smimmo </PERSON> said diapers are used successfully by horses in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. `` When I first heard about the diaper idea, I thought, what a stupid thing. But then when I started talking to drivers around the country, they said it works fine,'' she said. The diapers are scheduled to go into use May 1.

 Privacy was hard to come by in their parking lot home, but a brown killdeer successfully hatched a family in front of a group of birdwatchers. Decoy tactics by her mate drew little attention as those who had marveled at the nest witnessed the hatching of four eggs Friday. Last month, the killdeer and her mate spent about 10 days digging out their nest in the mobile home parking lot. Oversized trucks and mobile homes moved within feet of the nest, but the mother did not abandon her duty unless the male took over. Although both parents shooed away curious humans, the first two plum-sized baby birds sneaked out and, on wobbly legs, scampered inches toward an onlooker. `` Last week she took off and he sat on the eggs awhile,'' said <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Karr </PERSON>, a bird-watcher and employee at <ORGANIZATION> Sonshine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Homes </ORGANIZATION>, where the birds hatched. Co-worker <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Weekley </PERSON> added: `` She'll be glad when the baby birds are gone. I'll bet she'll never come here again.'' After the chicks hatched, the killdeer family escaped to the edge of the parking lot, <PERSON> Karr </PERSON> said Monday. He said he has seen the parents, but the babies `` are nowhere to be found.'' The brown killdeer has orange markings and typically is a shore bird. About 10 inches long, it runs on long, spindly legs and often nests in gravel.

<HEAD>Former CIA Station Chief Indicted Again</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agent was indicted anew on charges he lied about helping the Nicaraguan Contras, but a conspiracy allegation was omitted for apparently the same reason such an accusation was dropped against <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>. Six months after charges against <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> were dismissed on a legal technicality, a new indictment against the former station chief in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> was returned Monday. Missing was the charge that he conspired to deliver arms to the Contras when such aid was banned by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The original conspiracy charge alleged that <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> worked with former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> and arms dealer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> to set up the covert arms-supply network. The new indictment focused on charges that <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> lied to obstruct inquiries of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>'s inspector general and the presidential commission headed by former Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, that investigated the Iran-Contra affair. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Wieghart </PERSON>, a spokesman for prosecutor <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, refused to comment on why the conspiracy charge was not contained in the new indictment. But it appeared that <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> decided not to pursue that arms-resupply allegation because it was fraught with the same secrecy concerns that forced him to drop similar charges against <PERSON> North </PERSON>. Earlier this year, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> dropped charges that <PERSON> North </PERSON> conspired with others to divert $ 15 million in U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan rebels when the government refused to release secret documents the trial judge ruled were needed for <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s defense. A federal court jury in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is deliberating on 12 related charges against <PERSON> North </PERSON>, including allegations he lied to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about the Iran-Contra affair. Legal observers have considered the <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> case even more laden with secrecy problems because his lawyers are expected to seek court approval to disclose details of his <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> activities in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, where he used the alias <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON>. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> avoided those issues by obtaining a narrow indictment charging that <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> lied when he denied he helped set up the airstrip in northern <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> for the resupply operation and said he did not know that <PERSON> North </PERSON> was involved in the effort. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> is also accused of lying to the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> by stating that the airstrip was built by the <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rican </LOCATION> government to train pilots for a possible Nicaraguan invasion of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. Each of four charges in the indictment carries a maximum five-year sentence and a $ 250,000 fine upon conviction. The original five-count indictment, brought in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, was dismissed Oct. 19 after a judge ruled the charges should have been brought in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> because <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> was questioned at <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Langley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, just across the <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> gave <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> the option of bringing the charges again in federal court in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> is to appear there May 1 for arraignment before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>.

 The Who just ca n't stop talking about their generation. The legendary British rock group plans to celebrate their founding 25 years ago with their first tour in more than six years. `` We felt like we were n't trying to resurrect the band. This is a celebration of the music we created, after all these years,'' lead singer <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Daltrey </PERSON> said Monday. <PERSON> Daltrey </PERSON> joined composer-guitarist <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Townshend </PERSON> and bassist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Entwistle </PERSON> in announcing the planned tour of 25 North American cities this summer. It will be their first since a `` Farewell Tour'' of 1982-83. The band rode to fame a generation ago with the hit `` My Generation,'' a teen-protest song that included the line, `` Hope I die before I get old.'' They're now in their 40s, with <PERSON> Townshend </PERSON> acknowledging he has impaired hearing. And they have n't played together since a brief, rusty appearance at Live Aid in 1985. Does the band's chemistry still exist? `` We do n't know whether it's still there or what it is or where it comes from. We're going to get in the rehearsal studio and see what happens,'' <PERSON> Townshend </PERSON> said. Drummer <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> will join the group, and there also will be a keyboardist, horn player, percussion section and backup singers. The original Who drummer, <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>, died in 1978. The tour will include two full-length performances of the rock opera `` <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON>,'' with guest stars, in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The latter concert will be videotaped. Proceeds from those concerts and the video will benefit the <ORGANIZATION> Nordoff-Robbins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Therapy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> for autistic children. The band last performed `` <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON>,'' by <PERSON> Townshend </PERSON>, in its entirety 17 years ago in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The Who will play concerts with an intermission for the first time. `` I do n't know if that says anything about age,'' said <PERSON> Townshend </PERSON>, 43. The band will play at least three hours, performing music from the group's albums as well as the artists' solo efforts. <PERSON> Daltrey </PERSON> said they had decided against making an album to be released while they're touring. `` One of the reasons we stopped is we were on that album-tour-album-tour rat race of the rock' n' roll industry. To come back and do all that again we thought was a mistake,'' he said. Of his hearing problem, <PERSON> Townshend </PERSON> said: `` It's a ringing in the ears at the kind of frequencies at which I play the guitar. ... If I expose myself to loud electric guitar, particularly my own, my hearing suffers.'' `` I'm still very nervous about how I can work on stage without further damage to my hearing,'' he said, but then drew a laugh by adding: `` We're going to play very, very quietly.'' Scheduled stops are: <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> June 24; <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rutherford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, June 29; <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, July 4; <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, July 5; <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, July 7; <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, July 9; <LOCATION> Foxboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, July 12; <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, July 16; <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, July 18; <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, July 19; East Troy, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, July 21; <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, July 25; and <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, July 27; <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, July 29; <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, July 30; <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, Aug. 5; <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, Aug. 8; <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, Aug. 11; <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, Aug. 13; <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, Aug. 15; <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, Aug. 18; <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, Aug. 22; <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, Aug. 26; <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, Aug. 28; and <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, Aug. 30.

 Police arrested 58 flag-waving, slogan-chanting animal rights activists after they blocked traffic in a busy intersection and forced open a door at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is the first step in voicing your opinion and letting it be known that people are opposed to this kind of cruelty to animals,'' said <PERSON> Zakki </PERSON> <PERSON> Jewad </PERSON>, 25, of Silver Spring, Md. Organizers said the aim of the demonstration in this <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> suburb was to kick off a week of civil disobedience and rallies at research centers and universities nationwide. `` We're protesting the murders of millions of animals in research laboratories every year,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, 61, of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, who came to Monday's rally toting a sign and dressed in a full-length black cape and hood to represent death. During the demonstration, about 200 activists gathered on <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION>'s grassy lawn for speeches and vegetarian lunches <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> was targeted for the demonstration because it is the largest funding source for animal research, protesters said. Police arrested 37 activists after they linked hands and blocked traffic on a busy street for about 30 minutes. Officers dragged many across the road to allow traffic to get by. They were charged with disobeying a police officer and were released at the scene, according to <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> police. Following the arrests, the protesters proceeded to <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION>'s main administration building where they began to pound on doors and windows of the facility. One of the doors broke open and police arrested 21 of the protestors and charged them with trespassing. Some also were charged with breaking and entering, according to <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> officials. `` I really feared for the safety of the building,'' said Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Raub </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> Deputy Director. `` That group was absolutely out of control.'' <PERSON> Ginger </PERSON> <PERSON> Redmon </PERSON>, who said she had been arrested in two other animal rights protests, said the civil disobedience `` shows we have a strong commitment.'' <PERSON> Raub </PERSON> denied that animals were mistreated at <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's a fabricated story from start to finish,'' he said. `` There's no basis for that claim.'' To defend their research, medical and scientific experimenters plan to use this week to speak out in support of the use of animals in medical research, pointing to the medical breakthroughs such research has brought _ from coronary bypass surgery to cataract removal, from vaccines to antibiotics. `` There's no such thing as anybody not having received some benefit from animal research,'' said <PERSON> Frankie </PERSON> <PERSON> Trull </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Biomedical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, a nonprofit group that supports animal research. Animal research defenders also say most laboratory experiments are n't painful and about 90 percent of the animals used in such research are rodents bred specifically for lab experimentation. But <PERSON> Ingrid </PERSON> <PERSON> Newkirk </PERSON>, director of People for the <ORGANIZATION> Ethical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treatment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animals </ORGANIZATION>, said too much money goes toward unnecessary animal research. She estimated that the federal government spends as much as $ 6 billion a year on research using animals and said the same results could be derived in ways that do n't harm or kill animals. `` When it comes to feelings, they -LRB- scientists -RRB- believe that a rat is nothing more than a test tube,'' <PERSON> Newkirk </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Trust Fund Will Financed for Next Three Decades</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

 The Social Security old age and disability trust funds are financially sound and should be able to pay benefits until nearly the middle of the next century, according to a report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The report by the trustees of the Social Security system projected that income to the Old Age and Survivors and <ORGANIZATION> Disability </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Funds </ORGANIZATION> will exceed benefits paid out for the next three decades. After that, the combined trust funds will run a deficit until funds are exhausted in 2046. `` However, the expected accumulation of the trust funds during the next 20 to 30 years provides ample time to monitor the financial status of the program and to take corrective action at some time in the future,'' the report said. The report was signed by members of <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trustees </ORGANIZATION>, which includes Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, Labor Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, Health Secretary <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> and Social Security Commissioner <PERSON> Dorcas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON>. In this calendar year, the two funds combined will take in about $ 294 billion and will pay out about $ 236 billion. About 130 million workers will be covered by the program this year. The assets of the funds increased by $ 41 billion in calendar year 1988 from the previous year, in part because of the growth in the nation's economy, the report said. Based on intermediate economic and demographic assumptions, the combined trust funds are expected to swell to a level about five or six times the annual amount paid in benefits in the next 20 to 30 years, the report said. Under the worst conditions, combined funds would be expected to increase to about two-and-a-half times annual payout during the next 20 to 25 years, the report said. However, the report said, financial problems could occur within the next 10 years in the <ORGANIZATION> Disability </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> under these conditions. The Old Age and Survivors Insurance program pays benefits after a worker retires and to survivors after a worker dies. Disability Insurance pays benefits after a worker becomes disabled.

<HEAD>Bush Says Foreign Policy, Environmental Decisions Coming Soon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ESPO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> seems eager to look to the `` long road ahead'' as he rounds out 100 days in office, pledging to use the next several weeks to complete a detailed foreign policy review, draft environmental legislation and intensify his war on drugs. In all that he does, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> pledged Monday in a speech at the annual meeting of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, he intends to work closely with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think the work we've done these past three months demonstrates the value of tough, principled negotiation'' with the Democratic majorities of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, he told newspaper publishers gathered for the session. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s speech was the final act of rare back-to-back appearances by the president and vice president. Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who spoke to the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> meeting two hours earlier, said the biggest surprise of his first 100 days in national office was the enjoyment he receives from foreign travel and participating in foreign policy discussions. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who is off on a long trip to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, noted that as a senator most of his travel was back and forth between <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and his home state of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. In his remarks, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> pledged he would follow `` every intelligence lead'' in attempts to secure freedom for <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> correspondent <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> has been held captive for more than four years since being abducted in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The president told his audience he was n't able to `` give you any good news'' about the prospects for <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s release. But, he said, `` we will go the extra mile and do everything we can.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> summarized his first 100 days in office _ which end on Saturday _ by saying he is `` off to a good start ... and there's more to come. `` So while I'm pleased with all we've accomplished in these three months, there's a long road ahead of us,'' he said. `` I'm optimistic that our reforms will produce lasting results, that the long-range planning we do today will pay off in the future.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> identified several key issues as being `` on the near horizon.'' They include completion of a defense and foreign policy review, which will include decisions on arms control that presumably will pave the way for the next round of negotiations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` We are mapping strategies for a period of remarkable change in international affairs,'' he said, `` change more wide-ranging and rapid than at any time in the postwar period.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not mention recent complaints from Soviet officials that his new administration is missing an opportunity for progress by moving too slowly to address arms control and other U.S.-Soviet issues. Instead, he said Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> has met with Soviet Leader <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and will do so again next month. Also on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s list for the immediate future are legislation to strengthen the Clean Air Act, attack homelessness and curb the increased use of lethal weapons by drug dealers, he said. Summarizing his first 100 days as president, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> cited agreements with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on a deficit-reduction package that avoids tax increases and on providing non-lethal aid to the Contra rebels. He also ticked off several proposals he has made, including legislation to bail out the savings and loan industry and to strengthen ethics in government. In addition, he said his crackdown on drugs had begun with a first-of-its-kind attack on the problems in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> and the decision to ban the import of certain types of semiautomatic weapons. He also took credit for legislation to restrict the export of hazardous wastes, and said he has launched an initiative to deal with the debt owed to developed nations by the Third World. Most of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s AP speech was devoted to looking ahead to his Asian and Australian trip, including a pledge to maintain the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as a great <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> power. The vice president fielded questions after his prepared speech and said his first three months in office have given him a close-up view of the office of the presidency. `` I work every day in close quarters with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' he said. `` I see how he formulates his policies. I'm there to give my opinion.''

 A second effort to impose a youth curfew as part of an effort to curb the drug trade in the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> again failed to pass constitutional muster in a federal court. Hours before it was to take effect late Monday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Richey </PERSON> blocked enforcement of the curfew for at least 10 days pending a further hearing. `` There are serious First, Fourth and Fifth amendment concerns raised in this issue,'' <PERSON> Richey </PERSON> said, mentioning the constitutional safeguards of the right of assembly, reasonable search and seizures and due process. The bill, which would have required people under age 18 to be off the city's streets, sidewalks and other public spaces by 11 p.m. Sunday through Thursday and midnight Friday and Saturday, with some exceptions, was to have taken effect for 90 days at 11 p.m. Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> D.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> had approved the curfew April 4, amending a broader bill struck down by <PERSON> Richey </PERSON> on March 20. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spitzer </PERSON>, legal director for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, argued that no curfew could prevent youths from becoming involved with drugs and crime. `` It's absurd to think a youngster who's out dealing drugs and carrying a gun is going to go home and go to bed when the clock strikes 11,'' said <PERSON> Spitzer </PERSON>, who represents 15 plaintiffs. <PERSON> Spitzer </PERSON> said the curfew bill discriminates against poorer juveniles and defines the word `` parent'' too strictly, ruling out other adult relatives or friends. <PERSON> Spitzer </PERSON> pointed out that employers, not employees, are required by law to possess youths' work permits Assistant corporation counsel <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON> told <PERSON> Richey </PERSON> the <ORGANIZATION> D.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> adopted the `` least restrictive measure'' it could to tackle juvenile crime. The law would not infringe on constitutional rights, he said, but rather would place `` reasonable restraints'' for `` a valid reason,'' he said. Under the law, police would take violators to the nearest police station and call their parents. The first violation would not result in a fine, but parents would be fined $ 100 for the second curfew violation and $ 300 for all subsequent violations. The exceptions in the amended bill include minors accompanied by a parent; returning home from an activity sponsored by a church, school or non-profit organization; traveling in a motor vehicle; employed during curfew hours; or on an emergency errand. Only one federal court has upheld a curfew bill, in <LOCATION> Middletown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, in 1975, according to <PERSON> Spitzer </PERSON>. Since then, federal courts have struck down curfew laws three times.

 Some of the nation's top law enforcement officials worked in the dark for a while because construction crews could n't connect an emergency generator supplying power to part of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Electrical power to the southwest portion of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> building was knocked out last week when a power cable was severed by construction crews installing anti-terrorist security barriers on the west side of the building, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Burstion-Wade </PERSON>. Power was restored about 6 p.m. Monday but the outage inconvenienced many top officials for most of the business day. A large generator inside a tractor-trailer was plugged into the building to provide power.

He said that further inspection showed cracks and stress corrosion in the bolts. `` In this case, there was no accident and no loss of life,'' <PERSON> Reitz </PERSON> said. `` But you would have a big problem if this happened in flight. So a grounding order was issued immediately to ensure safety.'' The bolts at issue sit atop the main rotor hub and help hold the main rotor blades to the shaft.

 Acting President <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> has accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of secretly giving $ 10 million to opponents of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as part of a plan to retain control of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> said Monday that `` Panamanian traitors'' were conspiring to renege on the 1977 treaties under which control of the vital waterway is to be ceded to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in the year 2000. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s de facto ruler, accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of playing a `` dirty game.'' He told a news conference that `` the men who speak of democracy have dirtied their hands. `` The <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people _ and it is important that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> know this and that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> not be deceived _ are supremely angered.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been at odds with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, once a strong ally, since last year, when a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grand jury indicted him on charges of drug trafficking and money laundering. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and World Report said in its May 1 issue that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has signed a secret intelligence directive to give $ 10 million to the Panamanian opposition. It says the money was to be used for printing, advertising, transportation and communications for opposition candidates in May 7 elections. White House officials have refused to comment on the report, saying it involves covert operations. Attorney <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, who is running against Noriega-backed presidential candidate <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Duque </PERSON>, on Monday denied receiving any campaign funds from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We have n't asked for or received, nor are we going to receive, cent from foreigners nor from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> nor from any other power,'' <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> said in a television appearance. `` All the money we have used in this campaign has been Panamanian money and we would not accept any foreign money.'' The opposition has accused <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> of planning to rig the May 7 vote, in which Panamanians will choose a new president, two vice presidents, 67 legislators and 510 local representatives. <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> has called the election a plebiscite on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s de facto rule. <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> contended Monday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would resort to military intervention if its attempts to `` destabilize'' <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> failed. Last year, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration set in motion a plan to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday that if that approached failed, the administration wanted to organize a coup. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> rejected the coup plan, however, on grounds that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> might be assassinated, the Times reported. A presidential order forbids <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> participation in assassinations. Last spring, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> imposed economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in an attempt to force out <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> this month extended the sanctions, which include sharp restrictions on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies that do business in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, a hold on assets of the Panamanian government in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and a prohibition on tax payments by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> organizations to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s foreign minister has told the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> that his government will retaliate against <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> unless that country stops supporting the guerrillas trying to overthrow the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> regime. `` If the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> fails to adopt necessary measures for defusing the present tense situation, and if Pakistani aggression and intervention against our contry is continued, we will have no choice but the firm and patriotic defense of our country,'' the envoy, <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakil </PERSON>, said Monday. In a 90-minute speech, the foreign minister said <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> was as vulnerable to rocket attacks as <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, which has been bombarded by rockets transported across the Afghan-Pakistan border. He also charged that the guerrilla assault on the Afghan city of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> was being organized, armed and financed by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> with help from the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> are among major supporters and arms suppliers of the insurgents, who began fighting after a communist coup in April 1978. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> also serves as headquarters for seven guerrilla groups. Soviet troops entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 to back the government and completed their withdrawal Feb. 15 under U.N.-mediated accords. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> continues to supply the Afghan army. In the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> accords, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> pledged not to intervene in each other's affairs. The <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> insist that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is violating the agreement and want the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to take measures to end the alleged violations. The guerrillas laid siege to <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> on March 6 in their first major offensive following the Soviet troop withdrawal. Capturing it would give them a base for the exile government they formed in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> two months ago and help them gain momentum for an attack on <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the capital, 75 miles to the east. <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> is about 45 miles west of the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> frontier.

 Interest rates on short-term <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities have bounced back after a sharp drop last week. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sold $ 7.2 billion in three-month bills in Monday's auction at an average discount rate of 8.66 percent, up from 8.57 percent last week. Another $ 7.2 billion was sold in six-month bills at an average discount rate of 8.72 percent, up from 8.59 percent last week. The rates were the highest since April 10, when three-month bills sold for 8.71 percent and six-month bills averaged 8.78 percent. The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors _ 8.98 percent for three-month bills with a $ 10,000 bill selling for $ 9,781.10 and 9.25 percent for a six-month bill selling for $ 9,559.20.

 When <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> took office as prime minister, skeptics doubted that the man known for his cautious, back-room political style would be able to create a commanding role for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> on the international stage. Ironically, he proved successful at his diplomatic efforts, but it was his main strength _ fund-raising for the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> _ that brought him down after only 18 months on the job. In announcing today that he intended to resign as <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s 46th prime minister, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> took responsibility for a scandal that made the country's <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s least popular prime minister since World War II, according to polls. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, 65, took over as prime minister from the charismatic <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> in November 1987. Within two months of taking office he had visited the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and established a first-name relationship with former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. He traveled frequently to other countries. Under <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s leadership, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> surpassed the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as the world's biggest foreign aid donor to developing countries. It also earned new respect as a contributor to diplomatic efforts. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> also played busy host to dignitaries from 164 nations in February at the state funeral for Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, an unprecedented gathering of world leaders. But his popularity sagged among the Japanese with increasing revelations that he and members of his <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> had accepted bargain-priced stocks and other donations from the <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, an information conglomerate that allegedly attempted to buy government influence. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> acknowledged receiving more than $ 1 million from Recruit. He also confirmed that he borrowed about $ 381,700 from the company in 1987 and repaid the money a few months later. Recruit was a major donor to <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s fund-raising parties. Party tickets are an important tool in raising the money needed to gain and maintain office in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> was partly motivated to resign out of fear his term would be remembered for nothing but the Recruit scandal, said <PERSON> Yotaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Konaka </PERSON>, a political analyst. <PERSON> Konaka </PERSON> said the prime minister did not want to see the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> lose its 35-year hold on the nation's parliament in summer elections, or watch his newly implemented _ and highly unpopular _ tax reform program be canceled. `` Other than the emperor's funeral, he must have realized that the tax reform was his only domestic achievement,'' <PERSON> Konaka </PERSON> said. `` If the tax reform is erased, it will make him a prime minister with no achievement whatsoever.'' The eldest son of a rice-wine brewing family, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> was born Feb. 26, 1924, in a village in western <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. After serving as a pilot trainee at the end of World War II, he completed his university studies, taught English and social studies for several years, and then turned to politics. He was elected to his local state assembly at 27, and then won a seat in the powerful lower house of the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in 1958 at age 34. His political skills gained him key posts. He became finance minister in 1979 under Prime Minister <PERSON> Masayoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ohira </PERSON> and continued to hold that high post under <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>'s administration.

 The dollar finished lower against the Japanese yen Tuesday, but share prices on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> gained markedly following Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s announcement that he will resign. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, a 223.89-point loser on Monday, regained 438.86 points, or 1.34 percent, to finish at 33,244.78 points. The gain was the third-largest for one day this year. The dollar closed at 131.17 yen, down 0.21 yen from Monday's 131.38-yen finish The currency started higher at 131.65 yen and gradually fell while ranging between 131.05-131 .65 yen The yen rose as participants began buying the currency after the news about <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s resignation as well as the possibility of an interest rate hike by the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION>, traders said. Market players expect <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s resignation, coming after much uncertainty, to stabilize the yen, said a trader with a commercial bank in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> announced his decision to resign following a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> meeting late Tuesday morning. Also encouraging yen-buying were expectations that the Japanese central bank might raise its interest rate soon. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> Governor <PERSON> Satoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sumita </PERSON> at the bank's branch chief meeting Tuesday said the bank would swiftly take appropriate measures if instability of prices occurs. On the stock exchange, dealers attributed the sharp gain in the market's main index to <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s decision to resign. `` Investors have already expected the resignation to come sooner or later, and were reassured by the news'' because they believed the resignation would remedy current political instability, said a dealer with <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity.

 Two Palestinians who are American citizens have become entangled in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s military justice system and one disappeared after answering a summons to an army headuarters. Relatives of <PERSON> Jafer </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamayel </PERSON>, 25, said he complied with the army summons on April 13 and they have since been unable to locate him. The other American, 16-year-old <PERSON> Mansour </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdallah </PERSON>, was accused of throwing stones and has been held for three months without bail and without appearing in court, his lawyer said. Human rights activists say <PERSON> Hamayel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Abdallah </PERSON> are among thousands of Palestinians who are being denied basic legal rights under military justice in effect in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Army officials deny the allegations, saying the military has set up a special office to help lawyers find clients and that bail has been granted in hundreds of cases. `` We believe we have a liberal judicial system in the territories, but we should not be judged in the same context as Western countries that are not in a state of war,'' an army official said earlier this year. In the cases of <PERSON> Hamayel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Abdallah </PERSON>, both of whom had lived in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, the army was unable to locate either one even after being given details three days earlier by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. An army official, who could not be identified under military regulations, said he could not locate them because he did not have Israeli-issued identification numbers for them. Palestinian lawyer <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuttab </PERSON> said <PERSON> Abdallah </PERSON> has only a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> passport and not an Israeli identity card. <PERSON> Hamayel </PERSON>'s relatives said he had his Israeli card with him when he disappeared and they did not know the number. <PERSON> Hamayel </PERSON> was born in <PERSON> Kufr </PERSON> <PERSON> Malik </PERSON>, a mountain village known for its resistance to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation. On a visit Monday to the village 15 miles north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> slogans, <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags and a poster of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> adorned the main square. <PERSON> Hamayel </PERSON> left <PERSON> Kufr </PERSON> <PERSON> Malik </PERSON> in 1983 after being imprisoned for three months on charges of violating <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> law by raising <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags, said his uncle, <PERSON> Ata </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamayel </PERSON>, 39. He said <PERSON> Jafer </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamayel </PERSON> then lived for six years in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, joining his parents who went to the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> island in 1966 and now own a clothing store. The uncle said the young man had studied accounting at <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> InterAmerican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ata </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamayel </PERSON> gave this account of his nephew's disappearance: Several months ago <PERSON> Jafer </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamayel </PERSON> became a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen. On April 4, he returned to <PERSON> Kufr </PERSON> <PERSON> Malik </PERSON> to renew his Israeli-issued identity card. Without the card he would lose the right to live in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. Shortly after his arrival he was given a summons to appear at the military headquarters in <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> and went there April 13. Later that day, a <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> man saw <PERSON> Jafer </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamayel </PERSON> being held in a tent jail at the headquarters but the family has not seen him since and has not been notified by the army of his fate. Ata <PERSON> Hamayel </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consular officials were refused permission to see his nephew at the <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> headquarters. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consulate </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Good </PERSON> said efforts were made to find <PERSON> Jafer </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamayel </PERSON> but `` we have n't been able to make contact with him yet.'' Good refused to discuss details of the case. <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Sayyad </PERSON>, <PERSON> Abdallah </PERSON>'s lawyer, said the youth was arrested Jan. 23 in his native <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Surda </LOCATION> on charges of throwing stones and setting up road barricades. <PERSON> Sayyad </PERSON> said military officials failed to present <PERSON> Abdallah </PERSON> at court hearings March 19 and March 30 and have not responded to a request that the youth be released on bail. The lawyer said another court hearing is scheduled for Sunday. Good said consular officials visited <PERSON> Abdallah </PERSON> on March 24 and are trying to get him released on bail. He said <PERSON> Abdallah </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hamayel </PERSON> are the only two Palestinian-Americans being held under military detention. Good said he did know how many American citizens have been arrested since the Palestinian uprising began in December 1987 in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> but added: `` We never had more than three or four at a time.'' About 7,000 Palestinians with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> passports live in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and Israeli-annexed Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, according to Good. He said only a few live in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Army officials say at least 20,000 Palestinians have been arrested during the uprising, which has claimed the lives of 444 Palestinians and 18 Israelis. Army figures showed 6,650 Palestinians were being detained as of early April with 3,627 awaiting trial, 1,187 held under emergency laws that require no charges or trial, 974 awaiting sentencing and 862 serving sentences.

 <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> put a hand on an old family bible, looked into the eyes of an old family friend and took the oath of mayor, a job his late father held for 21 years. But in Orchestra Hall, surrounded by many state and local officials whose careers started with the blessing of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> boss <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, the new mayor said his administration would not resemble his father's vaunted army of loyal foot soldiers. `` Business as usual is a prescription for failure,'' he said Monday after he took the oath on his 47th birthday, noting that his father instilled him with values, but policies will be his own. `` The old ways of doing business simply are n't adequate to cope with the new challenges we face,'' <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> said City Hall will be open to all _ a pledge that produced optimism among his black election opponents and their supporters. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> is the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> city to replace a black mayor with a white. `` He appears to be using a reconciling approach as opposed to a polarizing approach, and that is good,'' said <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who supported two blacks and had warned during the campaign that <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> would return to the machine politics that marked the elder <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>'s reign. <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> was sworn in by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> <PERSON> Marovitz </PERSON>, a family friend who presided at the elder <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>'s six inaugurations. `` This is a sentimental journey for me,'' said the 83-year-old judge. The new mayor delivered an upbeat speech, mentioning few specific goals but acknowledging that the city's school system, labeled the worst in the nation by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Education Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, needs an overhaul. `` Today our foundation is crumbling and nothing but genuine school reform will repair it,'' <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> said. The former <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutor was elected April 4 to complete the last two years of the second term of the late <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s first black mayor. <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> succeeds <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, who had been acting mayor since <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s death 17 months ago. <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> defeated <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, who is black, in the Democratic primary Feb. 28 and then defeated black <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> and Republican <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON> in the general election. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s first election in 1983 led to a few years of bitter debate in <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, with a white majority blocking his programs. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> predicted that black aldermen would not act as obstructionists during <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>'s term. `` Wherever he -LRB- <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> -RRB- is correct, we're going to move right along with him,'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said, but if aldermen disagree with the mayor they will `` protect the gains of this community.''

 A chunk of ice the size of a volleyball crashed through the roof of a house during a thunderstorm and a meteorologist said it may have come from an airplane. `` You can safely say it was related to the thunderstorm, but I do n't think it fell out of the sky by itself,'' said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Buehner </PERSON>, meteorologist for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> office at <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. `` It had to have some kind of assistance.'' Most likely the ice accumulated on the wing of a plane and then fell off, <PERSON> Buehner </PERSON> said. But he checked with the control tower and was told there had been no reports of abnormal ice buildup. The ice smashed through the roof into a bedroom of a house owned by <PERSON> Duane </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cline </PERSON> as <PERSON> Cline </PERSON> was reading the newspaper in his living room Monday night. <PERSON> Cline </PERSON> said when he first heard the noise, he thought a car had crashed into his house, as one did a few years ago.

The ice apparently had broken into about 20 pieces, with the largest about the size of a softball, he said. <PERSON> Cline </PERSON> said he planned to store the ice in his freezer and may have it tested.

 <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parks </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who founded <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sausage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the first black-owned business to raise money with a public sale of stock, has died after a long illness. He was 72. Parks, who began to suffer from Parkinson's Disease in the mid-1970s, died early Monday at the <ORGANIZATION> Meridian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Multi-Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nursing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Towson </LOCATION>, hospital officials said. Baltimore-based Parks Sausage makes scrapple, sausage and other meat products for sale in stores from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. The company's slogan, `` More Parks Sausages, Mom,'' is well known throughout the Northeast. Parks founded the company in 1951 in an abandoned dairy in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. He took it public in 1969. `` That's so significant,'' said <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haysbert </PERSON>, the current chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sausage </ORGANIZATION>. `` Public financing of companies is what <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is all about. Underlining that achievement is that only three or four other black firms have followed Parks into public financing since 1969.'' Parks Sausage was one of the largest black-owned companies in the nation when <PERSON> Parks </PERSON> sold his interest in it in 1977 for $ 1.58 million. Parks also served on the <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> from 1963 through 1969 and pushed bills opening public accommodations to blacks and easing bail requirements for people accused of crimes. `` He was not a civil rights person in the confrontational sense,'' <PERSON> Haysbert </PERSON> said. `` But he worked behind the scenes to convince powerful people of the illogic of racism.'' `` I think that I proved that black businessmen not only can be successful, but that they can be successful on the same terms as anybody else,'' Parks once said. Parks was born in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and grew up in <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. He said he became interested in business while studying at <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. At the university, he roomed with Olympic sprinter <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, became the first black on the school's swim team and was the only black in his marketing classes.

 A pudgy super-hacker who agreed to plead guilty and spend a year in prison for computer fraud must stand trial after all because a judge thinks the proposed sentence is n't harsh enough <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Mariana </PERSON> <PERSON> Pfaelzer </PERSON> surprised <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitnick </PERSON>, his defense attorney and a prosecutor by rejecting their plea agreement on Monday and ordering <PERSON> Mitnick </PERSON> to trial. `` You have been engaged in this activity for far too long and no one has adequately punished you,'' the judge told the defendant, citing two previous convictions for computer fraud in 1981 and 1987. `` This is the last time you are going to do this.'' The judge suggested the 25-year-old <PERSON> Mitnick </PERSON> remains a danger and rejected a prosecutor's belated claim that <PERSON> Mitnick </PERSON> did n't destroy anything of value. <PERSON> Mitnick </PERSON>, clad in a blue prison uniform, appeared stunned by the rejection. Outside court, defense lawyer <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> expressed disappointment and said the judge's action took him by surprise. `` She obviously considers him a far greater menace than I do or the government does,'' he said. <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said it was unlikely <PERSON> Mitnick </PERSON> would agree to any new bargain involving a longer sentence. When the case began last December, prosecutors portrayed <PERSON> Mitnick </PERSON> as a brilliant youth obsessed with junk food and computers who used the code name `` Condor'' to infiltrate computer systems in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. They suggested he might have gained access to top secret <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> computers, but such charges were never brought. Last month, they agreed to a plea bargain. Under his plea, <PERSON> Mitnick </PERSON> had admitted he infiltrated <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s computer system and stole one of its programs. He also admitted stealing 16 <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> telephone codes and using them to make long-distance calls for free. The prosecution had agreed to dismiss two additional charges, one of which alleged <PERSON> Mitnick </PERSON> infiltrated the computer system of <ORGANIZATION> Leeds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. If <PERSON> Mitnick </PERSON> stands trial, those charges would be reinstated. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> told the judge he had `` thought long and hard'' before entering the agreement and concluded that <PERSON> Mitnick </PERSON>'s actions were n't seriously destructive. `` This is not a case where Mr. <PERSON> Mitnick </PERSON> destroyed anyone's computer or inserted viruses in a computer,'' he told the judge He also noted that the government would have to grant immunity to an alleged co-conspirator, <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> DiCicco </PERSON>, to obtain his testimony against <PERSON> Mitnick </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Pfaelzer </PERSON> was unmoved. `` I do n't think a year is long enough. And I'm not going to honor the agreement,'' she said. A pretrial report recommended a higher sentence, she noted.

<HEAD>Amnesty Says Capital Punishment In US Arbitrary, Racially Biased</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL WEST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, which opposes capital punishment in all circumstances, said today that the use of the death penalty in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> appears arbitrary and biased against blacks and Hispanics. In a 268-page worldwide report titled `` When the State Kills,'' the human rights group condemned the use of the death penalty as a `` judicial lottery'' that does not deter crime. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and 99 other countries execute people for crimes. `` Despite a range of safeguards, the use of the death penalty in the <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> appears to be arbitrary and racially biased,'' <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said in the report's introduction. The London-based group, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1977, criticized <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> for executing convicts for crimes committed when they were juveniles. In June 1988, 30 prisoners in 14 states were under sentence of death for crimes committed when they were under age 18. This is permitted by 25 states, the report said. As of May 1988, 2,048 prisoners were under the death sentence in 35 states, according to the report. Ninety-eight prisoners were executed from 1977 to May 31, 1988, including three juveniles, two in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and one in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. The report mentioned the case of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Roach </PERSON>. He pleaded guilty in 1977 when he was 17 to two murders, sexual assault, kidnapping and other charges, and was executed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> on Jan. 10, 1986. Amnesty said there are regional disparities in the numbers of death sentences. Four states _ <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> _ have accounted for more than three-quarters of all executions since 1977, the report said. `` Jury selection procedures in most states allow prosecutors to exclude committed opponents of the death penalty from sitting as jurors. ... Studies have indicated that this practice has created ` death-prone' juries,'' according to the report. It said black defendants, especially in Southern states, have often been convicted by all-white juries after prosecutors have excluded black prospective jurors. Blacks comprise 12 percent of the national population but 41 percent of prisoners under sentence of death, the report said. `` The evidence suggests that race _ especially that of the victim _ has an important bearing on the likelihood of a death sentence being imposed, especially in the Southern states. Although blacks and whites are the victims of homicide in almost equal numbers, most offenders who are sentenced to death are convicted of murdering whites.'' This was the case in 86 percent of trials in 1987, it said. Between January 1977 and May 1988, according to <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION>'s report, 45 of the 98 people executed were black or Hispanic and 84 were convicted of killing white victims, the report said. It cited the cases of <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jasper </PERSON> <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> as two since 1985 in which evidence emerged after the executions that strongly suggested innocence. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> also finds deficiencies in legal aid available to capital defendants. The lawyers often are `` inexperienced, ill-equipped to handle such cases and severely limited in their resources,'' it said. Most states do not provide legal representation for capital defendants after appeal to state supreme courts, so `` in order to file further appeals on constitutional grounds, they must rely on volunteer lawyers working without payment,'' the report said. Many prisoners awaiting execution may be mentally ill or mentally handicapped, it argued, and said at least six such prisoners have been executed since 1984. The report cites a 1987 study saying 349 people convicted of capital offenses between 1900 and 1985 turned out to be innocent and 23 of those people were executed.

 Much of the nation enjoyed fair skies today, but an unusual span of foul weather brought more rain to <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and thunderstorms produced hail and damaging winds in the Plains. The eccentric weather pattern over <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> created a series of mini-floods, traffic tie-ups and accidents, and clogged drains in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Elsewhere, thunderstorms produced golf ball-size hail in northeastern <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, and wind gusts up to 59 mph in northeastern <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A plan to make the city's government constitutional by expanding the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and setting up a new commission drew good reviews from the mayor but was panned by presidents of the five boroughs. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> A.O </PERSON>. <PERSON> Schwarz </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Charter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, outlined proposals Monday that would give the mayor more direct control over awarding contracts, previously the domain of the powerful Board of Estimate. The mayor would be required to submit his plans to communities for review, though. The proposals also would increase the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to 50 members from 35 and create a new commission to oversee city-owned land, rule on zoning changes and award city franchises, also currently the board's province. The mayor would appoint four of the 11 commission members. The plan comes one month after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled that the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estimate </ORGANIZATION> was unconstitutional because it violated the one-person, one-vote doctrine. <PERSON> Schwarz </PERSON> said he hoped his plan would provide fair representation for all New Yorkers. <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, the city's smallest borough with about 400,000 residents, has the same presence on the board as the other four boroughs, including <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> with 2.2 million residents. <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Borough </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamberti </PERSON> said the proposals `` are a disaster for <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and all local communities. It makes the authority of the mayor almost czar-like.'' <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Borough </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Golden </PERSON> said <PERSON> Schwarz </PERSON> `` is telling the boroughs to drop dead.'' But <PERSON> Schwarz </PERSON> said the plan would give borough leaders more say over land use, budget formulation and budget oversight. Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> and City Comptroller <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldin </PERSON> were generally pleased by the proposals. `` The principles that the chairman lays out in his report would seem to be quite positive,'' said mayoral spokesman <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> Chanin </PERSON>. Under the plan, the comptroller no longer would be involved in policy and would be limited to fiscal matters and oversight and audit functions on contracts. `` The comptroller's role has always been overwhelmingly fiscal,'' <PERSON> Goldin </PERSON> said. `` This recognizes that reality.'' The Charter Revision Commission, which was created by the mayor, has set a goal of getting a proposal for governmental change on the November ballot. The chairman's proposals are the first formal agenda on which the 15-member commission can debate. They are n't final.

 A confessed North Korean agent wept today as a court sentenced her to death for the 1987 bombing of a South Korean airliner in which 115 people were killed. Officials said they expect 27-year-old <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hui </PERSON> to be pardoned. Ms. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> shook with grief as Judge <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> <PERSON> Sang-hwak </PERSON> pronounced her guilty of violating national security and aviation laws and sentenced her to die by hanging. She said nothing before being whisked away by security agents. Relatives of the victims sat quietly as <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> said there was no doubt that Ms. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> was guilty of planting a bomb aboard a <ORGANIZATION> Korea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 707 that disappeared on Nov. 29, 1987 over the <LOCATION> Andaman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> as it approached the Burmese coast. The plane was en route to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> confessed on South Korean television in January 1988 that she planted the bomb as part of a plot by senior leaders of communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to disrupt the Olympic Games, held successfully in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> last summer. She said at a hearing on April 4 that she wanted to die to atone for the deaths. She has a week to appeal the sentence, but defense lawyers said no decision had been made on the matter. South Korean officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Ms. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> was expected to be pardoned on grounds she was duped by communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and has repented. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has denied it had anything to do with the plane bombing and has claimed it was engineered by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to embarrass the north. The two Koreas have been bitter rivals since the division of the peninsula at the end of World War II. Judge <PERSON> Chung </PERSON>, who headed the three-judge panel hearing the case, said the destruction of the plane underlined the threat the north poses to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s freedom and survival. `` We have an enemy which always tries to our destroy liberal democratic system. We must face that reality with resolute determination,'' he said in a 13-minute statement. The sentencing came after three hearings during which Ms. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> often sobbed into a hankerchief as she listened to testimony that the plane exploded in less than a second, killing all aboard instantly. The bodies were never recovered. Ms. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> arrived at the courthouse today under heavy security and hundreds of police surrounded the building to prevent protests by angry relatives or a possible threat from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> agents. Relatives of the victims disrupted the earlier proceedings and often yelled `` Kill her!'' They were silent today as <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> read the verdict and gathered in small groups outside afterward. Some relatives expressed satisfaction with the death sentence, but others urged mercy. Ms. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> said she and another intelligence agent pretending to be Japanese tourists planted the bomb disguised as a radio and a liquor bottle when they flew from <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Abu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dhabi </LOCATION>, where they got off. The pair were arrested a short time later in <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> and attempted to take cyanide hidden in cigarettes. The other agent, an elderly man, died, but <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> recovered and was extradited to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>.

 A bookmaker said he took as much as $ 1 million in sports bets from baseball great <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, prosecutors say. A transcript of a pre-sentencing meeting at <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> last Friday in the case of the bookmaker, former <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> restaurant owner <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON>, contained the $ 1 million allegation and a letter from baseball Commissioner <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> <PERSON> Giamatti </PERSON>. The transcript, which was released Monday, does not indicate that <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> bet on baseball. The <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reds </ORGANIZATION> manager would face a year's expulsion from baseball if he had bet on baseball games and a lifetime ban if he had bet on his team. <PERSON> Giamatti </PERSON>'s said in his letter to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> that he believes the bookmaker's testimony was truthful. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, baseball's all-time leader in hits, has declined to comment on <PERSON> Peters </PERSON>' statement or the commissioner's letter. But the judge was angry with <PERSON> Giamatti </PERSON>. `` There is evidence here, in my opinion, of a vendetta against <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> is to be sentenced by <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> on charges of cocaine distribution and tax evasion.

 Investigators were searching today for the cause of an explosion underneath <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s massive Rouge complex that killed two maintenance workers, tore holes in parking lots and flipped cars. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Spelich </PERSON> said the bodies of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, in his early 50s, and <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Stiener </PERSON>, 27, were found Monday evening in an underground tunnel. <PERSON> Spelich </PERSON> did not know how or when they died. The explosion Monday morning shook the underpinnings of the 1,100-acre complex just west of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and knocked out power to factories, including the plant that makes Mustang automobiles. <PERSON> Spelich </PERSON> said the complex would operate normally today, except for one glass-making building. Divers searched for the men after the tunnel was flooded with 4 to 6 feet of water. The blast apparently ruptured a water pipe, <PERSON> Spelich </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Spelich </PERSON> said the victims were employed by <ORGANIZATION> Doetsch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON>, a bus driver at the complex, said soon after the explosion he saw flames shooting 300 to 500 feet into the air for a short period. No fire damage was found, however. On the ground, concern that asbestos from steam pipe wrappings might escape into the air caused workers to wear masks and protective clothing. About 6,500 first-shift employees were sent home after the explosion. Monday afternoon shifts were canceled.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s first major domestic trip as president is off to a rocky start and there are more pitfalls on the horizon of his hectic four-day journey across <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The president's travels through <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> could end up as a melange of frenzied motion, mixed messages and missed opportunities. Even his aides expressed private concern over some of the scheduling. For example, in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> walked among the audience at a memorial service Monday, trying to console relatives of the 47 sailors killed on the battleship <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. Oddly, he seemed to snub almost half the relatives, ignoring the final three rows of grief-stricken families. White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> explained later that a military escort had steered <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> away after he completed the first four rows, incorrectly telling him he had met with all the immediate relatives. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> thought it was `` really a tragedy'' that some relatives had been ignored. If <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s journey embodies a particular theme, it's not obvious. Monday, his main focus was a review of his first 100 days in office. Today, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> delivers a speech in <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION> focusing on industrial competitiveness, deficit reduction, capital-gains tax cuts and other subjects. Then he jumps on Air Force One, flies to a military depot in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and hops a helicopter. His destination is a 213-acre ranch seized by the government from an alleged marijuana kingpin. He spends the evening in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> at a Hispanic salute to the president. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s trip underscores that he has adopted a different media strategy than <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who tried to shape news accounts by focusing on a single message each day and reinforcing it with colorful backdrops. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is all over the lot in terms of subjects and his staging is nothing spectacular. Privately, some members of the White House staff are embarrassed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s scheduling. It is rife with the kind of miscues that even a novice political candidate would avoid. It reinforces criticism that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has not been able to spell out in his first 100 days what he wants to do, the vision he has for his presidency. From the start of the trip, things went awry at the <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> memorial service. Despite the somber nature of the occasion, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> flashed a bright smile at the end of his speech and held a fixed grin on his face as he met one-by-one with the victims' relatives. His reaction was a nervous one; clearly he had been moved by the ceremony. He was seen with tears on his cheeks as he walked back to Air Force One. Explaining the contradiction between his smile and his sorrow, the president said later, `` The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> family's not very good at that kind of thing, anyway. But you've got to deal with it; you've got to show them concern. You know how you do it? Pray for strength.'' Next stop was <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> for an appearance before newspaper publishers at the annual meeting of The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. White House aides had considered using the occasion for an announcement about how <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will deploy nuclear missiles. However, the news leaked out several days ago that he wants to proceed with a mix of MX missiles and single-warhead weapons, denying <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a headline-grabbing pronouncement. As a result, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> merely ticked off the accomplishments of his first three months in office, declaring `` we've made a good start'' and promising `` there's more to come.'' Then he hurried away without a question and answer session. Next stop was a tree-planting ceremony in <LOCATION> Bismarck </LOCATION>, N.D. From the media's standpoint, the trip has major faults. There was no time to file stories after events in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The first filing stop was after 5 p.m. EDT _ dangerously late to win a prime spot in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> newspapers. TV network correspondents had to drop off in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to get their spots on the air and then race across country to catch <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will hold his first meeting with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> since the inaugural. It will be five hours before time is earmarked for reporters to send in stories, after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> arrives in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> to address the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> state legislature. That speech is to focus on energy issues _ competing with the stories about the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> reunion. On Thursday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> attends an international drug enforcement conference in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, rushes off to dedicate a drug-interdiction facility, and then hurries off to dedicate an Alzheimer's center. The trip concludes two days before the end of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s first 100 days in office _ a time for assessments and course corrections. Members of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s White House staff say they expect the next 100 days will be smoother.

 Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> headed for <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> today after paying a courtesy call on <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and praising the former president's support for anti-communist rebels around the world. `` President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did n't just say that freedom works here in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said in remarks late Monday in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to Citizens for the Republic, a fund-raising group that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> organized in 1976. The vice president then flew across the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, getting in some exercise en route early today by playing basketball with <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents during a refueling stop for <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Two at <ORGANIZATION> Hickam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Base near <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. Asked about the impending resignation of Japanese Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> amid an influence-peddling scandal, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he did not have all the details, but added: `` It's a democracy and whoever the leader of that democracy is, we'll work with.'' Noting that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> fought for aid to anti-communist guerrillas in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said the ex-president `` was n't content to sit back and wait for history to do our work for us; he wanted to give history a little nudge now and then. Nowhere was the so-called `` Reagan Doctrine'' more successful than in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, where Soviet occupation troops withdrew after long-running battles with U.S.-backed rebels, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` I believe that the defeat of Soviet forces in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> is having a profound impact on the evolution of the Soviet political system,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` For in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, the central myth of Soviet rule, the myth of the inevitability of Soviet triumph, was shattered.'' The fund-raising group also presented <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> with its `` <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Award.'' At a 30-minute meeting in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s office in a skyscraper with an ocean view, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> presented the former president with the American flag that had flown over the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> until the Soviets invaded the Afghan capital in 1979. The flag was later hoisted May 15, 1988, when the Soviets announced they would leave the country. `` I am very proud to have this,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as the two posed for pictures with their wives. In a brief question-and-answer session with reporters, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has done well in his first 100 days. `` He is there to keep in progress the things we did for eight years,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. Before leaving on his 27,000-mile, 12-day trip to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> attended a fund-raising event for <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s library and spoke briefly to the American Samoan community. The `` bold and strong'' message that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he would deliver to allies on his trip is that, `` American is strong _ she is healthy.'' After a refueling stop in <LOCATION> Pago </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pago </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Samoa </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s first stop was <LOCATION> Canberra </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s capital. After <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was visiting <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> before returning to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>5 Black Activists Acquitted of Subversion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A union leader acquitted of charges he tried to take control of an impoverished black township says he will rebuild the community organizations that authorities alleged were subversive. A judge on Monday acquitted <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayekiso </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metalworkers </ORGANIZATION>, and four other black activists of subversion charges ad said the boycotts they organized were legal protests of poor living conditions. Happy supporters carried <PERSON> Mayekiso </PERSON> on their shoulders from the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to the nearby <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> after the verdict. Police ordered the crowd to stop singing and chanting and told reporters to leave. <PERSON> Mayekiso </PERSON> told a news conference later that he and the other defendants would resume their activities and rebuild the community organizations that authorities said were undermining the township government. `` We're going to start where we left,'' <PERSON> Mayekiso </PERSON> said. `` The message we have been given is that the structures are legal.'' <PERSON> Mayekiso </PERSON>, 48, was charged with attempting a political takeover in 1985-86 of <PERSON> Alexandra </PERSON>, an impoverished black township adjoining some of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>'s most luxurious white suburbs. He had been jailed for 30 months until Judge <PERSON> P.J </PERSON>. <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> freed him on bail in December. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> said Monday the state presented no direct evidence that the defendants, their <ORGANIZATION> Alexandra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> or the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had planned unrest, attacks on police, the resignation of township council members or the establishment of people's courts. The judge said he had toured the township and seen the poor conditions. He said the community had developed a lack of faith and trust in authorities. According to <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Walt </PERSON>, the boycotts were intended to improve living conditions, not make the township ungovernable. The case attracted international attention. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> called the prosecution `` malicious and outrageous.'' `` The South African authorities knew all along that <PERSON> Mayekiso </PERSON> had committed no crime, but they jailed him for 901 days and subjected him to a long and costly trial,'' <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> said in a statement. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> criticized the state for first charging the defendants with treason. After acknowledging treason could not be proved, prosecutors substituted the lesser charges of subversion and sedition. In the trial, <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> asked the prosecutor whether rent and consumer boycotts were illegal in 1985-6. The prosecutor acknowledged they were not, but the government has imposed emergency decrees since that outlaw the organization of boycotts. During that period in <PERSON> Alexandra </PERSON>, dozens of people were killed in clashes with security forces and in attacks by crowds on township council members and black policemen. The entire council resigned and most black policemen moved out of <PERSON> Alexandra </PERSON>. Since then, the government has detained or restricted leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Alexandra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and undertaken a $ 45 million redevelopment program to provide sewage, electricity and paved streets to most of the 100,000 residents. Those acquitted with <PERSON> Mayekiso </PERSON> were <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Tshabalala </PERSON>, 38; <PERSON> Obed </PERSON> <PERSON> Bapela </PERSON>, 30; <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mdakane </PERSON>, 30, and <PERSON> Mayekiso </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Mzwanele </PERSON>, 24.

<HEAD>Bourbon Drinker Asks Damages for Son's Birth Defects</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A lawyer for a 4-year-old with severe birth defects said the child deserves to be compensated because a liquor company did not warn the boy's mother of the dangers of drinking during pregnancy. But a lawyer for the <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> B. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Distillery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Deerfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, said Monday the mother had been repeatedly warned over a period of years about the risks of alcohol and she kept drinking up to a half of a fifth of bourbon per day. No warning on the part of a manufacturer would have persuaded her to stop, the attorney said. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorp </PERSON>, the 4-year-old son of <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> and <PERSON> Candace </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, was born mentally retarded, neurologically impaired, developmentally stunted and malformed, according to the lawsuit filed by his parents. The Thorps contend that the liquor company should have provided labels warning that alcohol can cause birth defects. In court papers, Mrs. <PERSON> Thorp </PERSON> said she did n't know her drinking would damage her child. The case focuses attention on a federal law taking effect in November that will require labels on all beer, wine or hard liquor that alcohol can cause health problems and birth defects. In his opening statement Monday, a lawyer for the boy and his parents, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> was the victim of fetal alcohol syndrome and deserves enough money to take care of him for the rest of his life. <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON> said <PERSON> Beam </PERSON> knew about a link between alcohol and birth defects in 1978 but made no effort to inform the public. <PERSON> Beam </PERSON> decided, along with 22 competitors, not to place warnings on its beverages, <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON> said. Had warning labels existed and the information been out, the Thorps `` could have acted to see what could be done to safeguard this child,'' he said. In opening statements by the defense, lawyer <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON> said, `` Family members and doctors tried for years to get Candy to stop drinking. ... -LRB- She -RRB- ignored every warning she got. `` Evidence will demonstrate that <PERSON> Candace </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorp </PERSON> was warned not once but repeatedly'' about the possible effect of alcohol on pregnancy, he said. `` A warning on a bottle label would not have done any good.'' He also said he will prove that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>'s rate of development is not much different from that of his older sister, and that his condition is due to poor nutrition during pregnancy, heredity, and severe neglect during his early years by parents who are admitted alcoholics. In court documents, lawyers for <PERSON> Beam </PERSON> said, `` Beam does not concede that maternal alcohol consumption causes birth defects.'' An estimated 30,000 children are born each year nationwide with fetal alcohol syndrome, according to a 1982 study by researchers at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> leader today urged Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> or members of her immediate family to attend a memorial service for the 95 soccer fans killed in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s worst sports disaster. `` It is never too late to do the right thing,'' city council leader <PERSON> Keva </PERSON> <PERSON> Coombes </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> radio. `` All we can do is say we think you're making a mistake. Please, please come.'' The only members of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s royalty planning to attend Saturday's service in <LOCATION> Liverpool </LOCATION> are the <LOCATION> Duke </LOCATION> and Duchess of Kent.

A message from the queen will be read aloud by church leaders conducting the service. <PERSON> Coombes </PERSON>, leader of <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION>'s Labor Party-controlled local government, said the royal family is out of touch with ordinary Britons. `` It looks as if their advisers are ... are starting to lose the feel of ordinary men and women up and down the country, who are very keen on the monarchy,'' he said. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s royal family also was criticized for failing to attend a memorial service for the 270 people killed in the bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103. <PERSON> Coombes </PERSON> said either the queen, her husband or one of their children should attend Saturday's service for <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> fans who were crushed to death at a soccer match in <LOCATION> Sheffield </LOCATION> on April 15. Prince <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, heir to the British throne, and his wife Princess <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> visited the injured at a hospital in <LOCATION> Sheffield </LOCATION>. Buckingham Palace said today that <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> would visit the <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Football </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> next week. `` Everybody appreciates their going to the hospitals and comforting those who are alive, but I think they need to listen a bit more closely perhaps to ordinary men and women than some of their advisers in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Coombes </PERSON> said.

 Two pregnant correction officers say a city health official told them to have abortions or face losing their jobs.

 The founder of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said today the rebel slaying of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> colonel was justified because of American `` aggression'' in the country. `` I think we can not say that what happened was bad at all,'' <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Sison </PERSON> told a <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> radio station of the killing Friday of Col. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> `` </PERSON> <PERSON> Nick </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON>, 51, a Vietnam War hero and former prisoner-of-war. Communist rebels have said they shot and killed <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> McAllen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, man was ambushed en route to work at the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> headquarters. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> continues with perpetuated aggression,'' <PERSON> Sison </PERSON>, who lives in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, told independent radio DZXL. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON>'s body will be flown to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> today, but they refused to give further details at the request of his family. Military Chief of Staff Gen. <PERSON> Renato </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> said <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON>'s killing adds a new dimension to the 20-year-old Communist insurgency. `` They are apparently targeting foreign nationals and that is a new situation for all of us,'' <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Villa </PERSON> told reporters. `` You can not win a war in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> through assassination and murder.'' Defense Secretary <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> charged the rebels are escalating `` their terror campaign'' because `` they have failed in their military struggle'' against the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> armed forces.'' He called on the public to rally behind the government so the international community sees it can `` effectively take measures to protect the population and also our foreign visitors.'' Police chief Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Montano </PERSON> said police are more interested in destroying the rebel capability for assassinations than in arresting individual killers. `` It is immaterial whether we get the real hit men or not,'' <PERSON> Montano </PERSON> said. `` What is more important to us is the destruction of their terror machinery. The Communist hit man can be anybody.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> maintains six military facilities in the country, including <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Subic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION>, both north of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. The lease on the bases expires in 1991. Last Sunday, the Communist-led <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> urged political parties to ally themselves with the front in its campaign against the bases. `` I think it is preferable that a national alliance is created to fight and oust the Americans from the bases,'' <PERSON> Sison </PERSON> told the radio station. He founded the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> in 1968 and was arrested Nov. 10, 1977. He remained in jail until a month after President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> took office in 1986. <PERSON> Sison </PERSON> then went abroad and won political asylum in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> last year after the military filed subversion charges against him.

 Princess <PERSON> Tokhye </PERSON>, one of the last survivors of the ancient <PERSON> Yi </PERSON> <PERSON> Dynasty </PERSON> that ruled <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> for five centuries, was buried today amid prayers for the woman one mourner called `` the unhappy princess.'' Official mourners dressed in traditional white hemp clothes and tall hats carried the lacquered black coffin to the grave site on a hillside in the royal burial grounds east of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. The princess died Friday at age 77. `` She was the most beautiful and most noble of princesses,'' said <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>, who attended the funeral. `` And she was the most sad.'' The grave site was chosen by a traditional pungsu, or fortune teller, who decides the most auspicious location and timing of a burial. He used a compass to align the casket in keeping with a Korean belief that a corpses' feet must point south to ensure a happy afterlife. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hae-suk </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Yi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynasty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> who helped arrange the ceremonies, said Princess <PERSON> Tokhye </PERSON> probably would n't mind if her feet did n't quite point due south because her life had been difficult. `` She was a very unhappy princess,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>. `` She would be used to being a little off.'' About 75 people, many of them spectators, attended a traditional Confucian burial ceremony at <LOCATION> Changdok </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palace </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, where the princess spent the last years of her life as a recluse. The body was then taken to the royal burial grounds. Princess <PERSON> Tokhye </PERSON>, a daughter of King <PERSON> Kojong </PERSON>, the last <PERSON> Yi </PERSON> <PERSON> king </PERSON>, was born to a royal concubine named <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> in 1912, two years after her father was forced to abdicate by the Japanese, who took control of <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. At age 13, she was sent to school in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and later married a Japanese nobleman much older than herself. Her mother died before she could return to <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and her only child committed suicide. In 1951, the princess was divorced from her Japanese husband and in 1962 she returned to her homeland, suffering from diabetes and aphasia. Visitors said she was sometimes heard humming or singing to herself, but she had n't spoken for many years.

 With a nurse monitoring the blood pressure of one panel member, the jury in <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s Iran-Contra trial resumed deliberations today. The 12 members beginning their fourth day of considering <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s fate have yet to actually discuss his guilt or innocence, with their time so far spent reviewing documents `` We are reading through documents that pertain to charges,'' jury foreman <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said in a note to the judge Monday, adding, `` No talking.'' Juror <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 53, experienced bouts of high blood pressure Monday and a note sent out to the judge in the afternoon asked for a nurse to take her blood pressure. The monitoring continued today. Federal court rules provide that a jury can proceed with 11 members at a judge's discretion. Losing two members, however, would in all likelihood result in a mistrial. There is a provision under which a jury could reach a verdict with fewer than 11 members if both sides agreed to it and the judge approves it. North is charged with 12 criminal counts, including lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and to the attorney general during the Iran-Contra affair, illegally converting travelers checks to his own use and conspiring to defraud the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>. At the jury's request, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> moved it out of a small room across from the judge's chambers and into the main courtroom where <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s trial took place. The jurors were deliberating around the two big tables where prosecutors and <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers tried the case. Meanwhile, at least one of the panel's members was angered by an invitation to give interviews after the trial is over. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said that NBC News had left unsigned letters at the jurors' homes containing the invitations. He called it `` most inappropriate ... quite disrespectful of the situation we are dealing with.'' One of the letters was picked up by a deputy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshal, who informed the juror and withheld the document. The juror `` was angry'' about having gotten the letter and mentioned it to other members of the panel, who `` said they did n't want anything to do with'' the invitation, said the judge <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubble </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said, `` It was intended for them to see them when they got home after they made their decision after the trial. ... I think once people understand what happened, there's not much of a problem with it really.'' She added, `` We're sorry if there was any inconvenience or misinterpretation.''

He was sentenced to 14 years' jail in February 1985 for his part in the 1984 kidnapping and murder of <PERSON> Popieluszko </PERSON>, a Roman Catholic priest who fervently supported the independent trade union that was banned by authorities at the time. <PERSON> Popieluszko </PERSON>'s body was recovered from the <LOCATION> Vistula </LOCATION> river northwest of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. The other officers received longer sentences and a court upheld the verdicts during a 1985 appeal. However, <PERSON> Chmielewski </PERSON>'s sentence later was reduced twice, most recently in 1987 when the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> cut his prison term to four years on humanitarian grounds. The sentences of the other three killers also have been reduced sharply. <PERSON> Popieluszko </PERSON> has become a symbol of Solidarity's struggle and his grave at the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> church where he served has become a pilgrimage site for Poles and foreigners. This weekend, Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> laid flowers on the grave to mark the priest's name day. Solidarity was suppressed when martial law was declared in December 1981, and outlawed the following October. It was legalized earlier this month.

 Palestinian attackers today stabbed to death two Arabs accused of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. The deaths were the latest of several recent attacks on alleged collaborators. Underground leaders of the Palestinian uprising had called for Wednesday to be a day of vengeance against Arabs aiding the Israelis. Army officials said they were unaware of the two deaths. Three Palestinians were reported shot and wounded in clashes with soldiers today, one in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, another in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> city of <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON> and a third in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>'s Shati refugee camp. Seven children between the ages 8 and 14 also were struck with rubber-coated metal pellets in confrontations with troops in <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports and hospital officials said. The army said it was checking the reports. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Suseya </LOCATION>, Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> urged Israeli Jews to keep settling the occupied lands. The government said Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> would visit the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> next month to give details of <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s plan to hold Palestinian elections in the territories occupied in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. In <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fauzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhareb </PERSON>, 45, was fatally stabbed near his home early today, Palestinian reporters said. The reporters, who requested anonymity for their own safety, said <PERSON> Muhareb </PERSON> was a collaborator and a drug dealer. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said police arrested three suspects. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the body of a 21-year-old Palestinian who was beaten and fatally stabbed was brought to a hospital. The victim, identified as <PERSON> Azam </PERSON> <PERSON> Qadi </PERSON>, was described as a collaborator by Palestinian sources. In a leaflet issued nearly two weeks ago, the Unified National Leadership of the Uprising called for Wednesday to be `` a day of accounting for the collaborators.'' Within the past week, at least five alleged collaborators were reported killed in the occupied lands. The latest deaths would bring to 24 the number of Palestinians slain as alleged collaborators this year, in addition to 11 last year, <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> sources say. Not counting the two reported deaths today, 444 Palestinians have been killed in the uprising, most by army gunfire during stone-throwing clashes. Eighteen Israelis also have been killed. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio reported today that uprising leaders called for the rape of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> women as a way of forcing their husbands to stop working in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. It said the threat had been carried out against six <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> women. But Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Zvi </PERSON> <PERSON> Poleg </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> commander in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, said he had no reports of sexual assault in connection with the revolt. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, speaking at the dedication of a new archaeological park aimed at luring more tourists to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, said Israelis would settle in all regions where Jews once lived. `` In every place where Jews ever set foot in past generations, the Jewish people shall return,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told 4,000 people in <LOCATION> Suseya </LOCATION> in the Judean desert. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s visit to the occupied lands comes as he tries to win <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for his <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace plan. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has been trying to get <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> to halt Jewish settlement in the occupied territories, where about 70,000 settlers live amid 1.7 million Palestinians. A <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> would travel to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in mid-May to discuss the plan further. The plan includes proposals to hold elections in the occupied lands and improve conditions for Palestinian refugees. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> rejects any <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> participation in the negotiations and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> `` land for peace'' formula.

<HEAD>Former Prime Minister Heath ``Affronted'' At Defeat By A Woman</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Former Prime Minister <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Heath </PERSON>, whom <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> ousted as <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader in 1975, felt affronted at being defeated by a woman, a former deputy prime minister said in a television interview released today. <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitelaw </PERSON>, who was deputy prime minister until retiring last year, said <PERSON> Heath </PERSON> also felt betrayed by the party. He spoke on a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> program about him titled, `` The Power Behind the throne,'' which is to be broadcast Wednesday. <PERSON> Whitelaw </PERSON> said he, too, was `` desperately upset'' when Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> defeated <PERSON> Heath </PERSON> and he doubted that a woman could lead a political party or be prime minister. `` That is a dreadful male chauvinist remark, but it had never happened before,'' <PERSON> Whitelaw </PERSON> said. `` So I had these questions in my mind. Was the country ready to vote for a woman as a leader? Would she have the strength of purpose? ... Would she be able to control a whole lot of men in a Cabinet?'' `` That makes one laugh today but it was true then,'' <PERSON> Whitelaw </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> ousted <PERSON> Heath </PERSON> after he lost two consecutive elections. She became prime minister when the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> won power again in 1979. In the leadership contest, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> outpolled <PERSON> Heath </PERSON> in a first ballot among Conservative members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Heath </PERSON> withdrew, <PERSON> Whitelaw </PERSON> joined the contest in the second ballot and she defeated him, too. <PERSON> Whitelaw </PERSON>, 70, became a trusted <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> supporter, serving in her Cabinets and being made a peer in 1983. He was deputy prime minister until he quit after suffering a stroke last year. In contrast, <PERSON> Heath </PERSON>, 72, is an embittered rank-and-file legislator who periodically attacks Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> publicly. <PERSON> Whitelaw </PERSON> described <PERSON> Heath </PERSON>'s attitude as `` strange and sad.'' `` But I think <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> felt desperately and totally betrayed by the party,'' said <PERSON> Whitelaw </PERSON>. `` So this rather shy, rather withdrawn man, felt deeply affronted,'' said <PERSON> Whitelaw </PERSON>. `` Certainly he would mind more than most people who had been beaten by a woman. Most men would n't like it, but I think he minded more.''

 A USS Iowa crewman who was in the gun turret that exploded and killed 47 sailors says he was waiting for its massive 16-inch guns to fire but the blast he heard `` did n't sound right.'' After the explosion, <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> recalled Monday, he and 10 others in the bottom of the turret tried to radio sailors on the five upper decks but none answered. `` We knew that something was drastically wrong,'' said the gunner's mate 3rd class, who is from <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. He said he then ordered the gunpowder magazine secured and the area evacuated. The quick actions of the 11 and other <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> crewmen were critical in preventing an even bigger tragedy aboard the World War II-era battleship, Capt. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON> said. `` I ca n't say enough about the hundreds of heroes who fought the fire and saved the ship,'' <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON> said. `` God gave birth to 500 heroes.'' The two spoke at a news conference several hours after a memorial service for the victims at the <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s home port. About 6,000 mourners heard President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> praise `` the men behind the guns.'' `` They came to the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> as strangers, served the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> as shipmates and friends, and left the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> as brothers in eternity,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Afterward, he and his wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, consoled victims' families <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials have refused to speculate on the cause of Wednesday's blast that occurred during a gunnery exercise off <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. Officials said they had no idea when an investigation would be completed. `` There was a tremendous amount of damage done and of course lives were lost so it will be a very thorough investigation,'' Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, said today. `` There are lots of theories floating around,'' <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON> said. `` Unfortunately, all the witnesses are dead.'' Officials also said they have n't finished assessing the damage to the turret. <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON> refused to give a definite answer to questions about whether the turret could be repaired. He said the battleship could operate without it if necessary. The <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> has three turrets, each with three 16-inch guns. The captain said there were no indications of any problems with the guns before the blast. The No. 1 turret had already fired its rounds, <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON> said, while in the second turret, the practice projectiles and five 110-pound bags of powder had been loaded into the right and left guns. <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON> said a projectile was loaded into the center gun and the crew was loading powder behind it when the explosion occurred. `` That was my best turret,'' <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON> said. `` The turret's senior chief was the most meticulous man I've ever met You talk about training ... nobody in that turret did anything unless they were qualified. Of the 84 chiefs on the ship, he was No. 1.'' He was referring to Chief Gunner's Mate <PERSON> Reginald </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziegler </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gibson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Ziegler </PERSON>, 39, was the oldest victim. The ship's weapons control officer, Cmdr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>, said the guns had passed a rigorous inspection that morning. They had been fired last in early February, he said. The powder also had been inspected before the exercise, <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> said the 11 on the turret's bottom level were not sure what had happened immediately after the blast, but they `` knew that did n't sound right.'' The men opened a door leading to the next level and immediately realized the turret was on fire. They escaped through a hatch that led to ladders outside the turret. `` As I was crawling out of the space ... smoke was filling all the spaces,'' <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> said. The first thing that came to mind was a nearby magazine full of powder, he said. Seven minutes after the explosion, <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON> ordered the ship's magazines flooded to prevent the fire from spreading and causing a larger blast <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> said there was a special bond among the 25 men in the turret with the rating of gunner's mate. Only one other survived with him. `` I lost 23 friends right there,'' he said. Some of his shipmates have n't recovered from the shock, <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> said, `` but I'm working on it. <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON> said he expected some crewmen would ask to leave the battleship after the trauma of the accident, but <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> said he would be willing to serve in a turret again. `` I do n't see the likelihood that it will ever happen again,'' he said. <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON> vowed when the ship goes to sea again, `` I'll be in the turret when the first shot goes up.''

<HEAD>Gingrich Book Partnership Reported Tax Loss Of More than $100,000</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The partnership created in 1984 to promote a book co-authored by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Whip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gingrich </ORGANIZATION> reported a loss of more than $ 100,000 during its first five years, according to partnership tax returns released today by <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>. The COS Limited Partnership was formed by 21 individuals or corporations that each put up $ 5,000 to pay for a promotional campaign for `` Window of Opportunity,'' written by <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, his wife, <PERSON> Marianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Drake </PERSON>. One person, <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, received a $ 5,000 share of the partnership for editorial work. The partnership is the subject of a formal complaint filed with the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee by Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ark </LOCATION>., accusing <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> of 10 apparent violations of House rules The committee has not indicated whether it will launch a preliminary investigation of <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>'s complaint. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> initiated the investigation that resulted in the filing of 69 ethics charges against <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> last week. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> has denied any wrongdong in connection with the book deal. He released several hundred pages of documents today identifying the 21 partners and detailing the organization's finances and incorporation history. The documents, including the partnership's tax returns for 1984-1988, were released in response to questions submitted by news organizations The partnership agreement with the book's publisher provided that the partnership would get half of the publisher's profits in exchange for promoting the book. But despite the partnership's expenditure of $ 51,571 to advertise and promote the book from 1984 through 1986, the publisher reported to <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> and his wife in 1988 that there was a net loss of $ 6,259 on the book. The 1988 accounting from the publisher showed that 58,996 copies of the book were sold to bookstores, but 29,981 of those copies were returned. Net sales of the book totaled $ 122,120. Because the partnership received no profits from the book sales, the $ 104,185 loss it generated between 1984 and 1988 was distributed among the partners, providing them with tax writeoffs. Mrs. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, as general partner of the partnership, received a $ 10,000 payment in 1984 for her work in setting up the organization, and later was given a 2 percent interest in the partnership for her work, according to the documents. She did not invest any of her own money in the partnership. In written responses to questions from reporters, Mrs. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said she also received a recent $ 1,500 payment from the partnership `` for part of the work I have done since the partnership was formed.'' `` I have worked hard in organizing and running this partnership,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said. `` I have been paid for my work and my legal responsibilities According to the partnership agreement, I am entitled to more than I have been paid so far.'' <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>'s complaint alleges in part that the payments and ownership interest in the partnership that Mrs. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> received were gifts that violated House rules limiting gifts that members may receive. The complaint also alleged that because of the unusual nature of the partnership promotional deal, the royalties <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> and his wife received from the book do not fit the definition of royalties in <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules and thus constitute a violation of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> limits on outside income. According to the documents released by <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, he and his wife each received $ 7,018 in royalties from the publisher. Under the agreement with the publisher, the three authors received a total 10 percent royalty on hardback sales and 8 percent on paperbacks. While the documents identify the 22 partners in the book promotional deal, <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> did not respond to questions about whether he had intervened with any agency of the federal government in behalf of any of the investors. The 21 investors were <PERSON> Richmond </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Aggrey </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Peachtree </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Bigard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Newton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Coors </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferst </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Guthman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Krieble </PERSON> of Old Lyme, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Milliken </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Spartanburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>; O.D. <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Gregor </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Incline </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoerner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Carrollton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Marguerite </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Thomasville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Peachtree </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Calloway </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Peachtree </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Flowers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Thomasville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>; Jean Hails of <LOCATION> Roswell </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>; Estate of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> McClain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> College </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mashpee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Thomasville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Carrollton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tidwell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Douglasville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Thomasville </LOCATION>, Ga.

<HEAD>West Germany Insists On Superpower Talks On Short-Range Weapons</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> said today it was sticking with its demand for superpower talks on short-range nuclear weapons despite <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s refusal to begin such negotiations. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> also said <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> would be speaking with other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> partners about the internal alliance dispute over the short-range weapons. `` We are going into the talks with our partners with the same position that we have already worked out,'' <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> told reporters. <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> and Defense Minister <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> had just returned from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, where they tried to convince <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials of the need to take up early talks with the Soviets on reducing short-range nuclear weapons. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> are concerned that negotiating the missiles issue with the Soviets could lead to stripping the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies of their ground-based nuclear weaponry, leaving them at the mercy of stronger <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact conventional forces. Most of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s short-range nuclear weapons _ 88 <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> launchers with a range of up to about 75 miles _ are based in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> also is opposed to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposals to upgrade the Lance missiles. The issues are expected to be at the forefront of the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> at the end of May. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s support for talks on the short-range weapons comes amid a growing anti-military mood among the populace and predictions that Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> could lose next year's elections The missiles are a subject of irritation in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Because of their short range, the nuclear-tipped missiles are designed to hit targets almost exclusively on German soil. <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> said his talks with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials had resulted in a `` better understanding'' of the positions of both sides, but he gave no indication there would soon be a breakthrough in attempts to resolve the dispute. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> will fly to <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> on Sunday to try to persuade <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> to suspend his campaign for U.S.-Soviet negotiations on the issue. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> has support among several of the smaller <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> countries, including <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>.

 A Cuban family from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> stranded in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> since a pre-Christmas sightseeing trip because of immigration problems reportedly may soon be allowed to return home. Immigration and Naturalization Service District Director <PERSON> Benedict </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferro </PERSON> will approve <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Fajardo </PERSON>'s bid for political asylum within the next few weeks, ending the family's exile in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Buffalo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported today. <PERSON> Fajardo </PERSON>, his wife, <PERSON> Bermaida </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora-Powers </PERSON>, and her two children have lived on charity since Dec. 23, when they were denied re-entry into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at the <LOCATION> Rainbow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Niagara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>. The couple, both considered illegal aliens, told border authorities that they had driven north to see snow for Christmas and had crossed the border into <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> to view <LOCATION> Niagara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fajardo </PERSON> owns a home and a small boat-building business in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. Officials have alleged he entered the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> illegally in 1985 from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. His wife and her children by a previous marriage allegedly entered the country illegally in 1986 from <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and an immigration judge ordered them deported last August. <PERSON> Ferro </PERSON> would not discuss the case in detail but confirmed that new information could substantiate <PERSON> Fajardo </PERSON>'s claims that he would face political persecution if he were returned to his native <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. `` Mr. <PERSON> Fajardo </PERSON>'s claim is clearly not frivolous,'' <PERSON> Ferro </PERSON> said told the News. `` If indeed it proves to rise to the level of a well-founded fear of being persecuted if returned to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, we will grant him asylum.'' `` It looks like we may be able to work something out,'' said Sister <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Rimar </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fajardo </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Charities </ORGANIZATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>. After they were denied re-entry, the Fajardos lived for several weeks in a motel in <LOCATION> Niagara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, then in a <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION> apartment under the sponsorship of <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> refugee groups. <PERSON> Fajardo </PERSON> had a previous application for asylum pending, but it was nullified when he crossed the border into <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, officials said.

 Police were examining evidence from skeletal remains found along a highway to see if it fits the pattern of a serial killer or killers believed to have slain at least eight women in the area. The remains were found Monday by state workers clearing brush along Interstate 195, about 12 miles east of <LOCATION> Dartmouth </LOCATION>, where bodies of four of the eight victims were found, also along the highway. `` The parallels are there,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbett </PERSON>, assistant district attorney for <LOCATION> Plymouth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. `` It's certainly reasonable to make the assumption that there is some connection between them.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Pina </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> district attorney, said a brief examination of the scene in <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> indicated there were `` exact, numerous similarities'' between the eight victims and Monday's discovery. <PERSON> Corbett </PERSON> would not say whether the body was that of a male or female, and added that officials were not able to determine whether it was a homicide. An autopsy was to be done today. Three other victims were found along Route 140 in <LOCATION> Freetown </LOCATION>, and the eighth was found along Route 88 in <LOCATION> Westport </LOCATION>. The three locations, all within a 10-mile radius, are in <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> is in <LOCATION> Plymouth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. The eight dead women had ties to Weld Square, an area of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION> associated with prostitution and drugs. Police have said that as many as three missing women may be additional victims.

 Christian army units and Syrian gunners poured rocket and artillery fire on <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in an escalation of violence today, the eve of an Arab League meeting aimed at ending the fighting. Police said at least two people were killed and 16 wounded in the bombardment, which began at midnight and raged until 6 a.m., then dwindled to sporadic exchanges. The deaths raised to 272 killed and 991 wounded the toll since the latest round of fighting broke out March 8 in the 14-year-old civil war that pits Christians against Moslems. The city shook as army troops under Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> fired 155mm and 130mm howitzer and mortar shells into Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The only sound other than the blasts of shells was the occasional siren of a Civil Defense ambulance. Civilians scurried to basements and underground shelters. The Syrians opened up on east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, the heart of the besieged 310-square-mile Christian enclave, with 240mm mortars and BM-21 launchers, which fire 40 122mm rockets in 20 seconds. Four shells crashed in the garden of east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s Comfort Hotel, which houses offices of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeepers and the U.N. Relief and <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, police said. Windows were shattered and windshields of five <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> cars were blown out, the hotel and a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official said. Shells destroyed the facade of the three-story <ORGANIZATION> Goethe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a West German cultural center in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Police said west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Sahel </LOCATION> hospital on the main airport highway took several direct hits that damaged equipment but hurt no patients. On Monday, Moslem forces fired rockets at a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> tanker as it delivered fuel to restart power stations, police reported. Much of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, including <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, has been without electricity since fuel for power stations' generators ran out nine days ago. Police said four rockets crashed into the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> about 700 yards from the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> navy tanker, the Penhors, as it unloaded 4,000 tons of fuel in the Christian town of <LOCATION> Zouk </LOCATION> north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The salvo was fired despite what <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> officers called `` solid guarantees'' given to French Ambassador <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanc </PERSON> by <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> and Syrian commanders that there would be no shooting while the tanker unloaded. The delivery of the fuel oil caused an interruption in the stream of refugees fleeing <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> from the Christian-controlled port of <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION> north of the city. An aide to <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said he ordered two Cypriot-flag ferries to stop picking up Christians while the Penhors unloaded. Foreign ministers of the 22-member Arab League are to meet in an emergency session in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, on Wednesday to find ways to end the violence. Three cease-fires arranged by the league have collapsed. An Arab League committee will recommend that the group send an observer force of people from all <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states to monitor a cease-fire, said <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Ahmed </PERSON>. The current fighting erupted after <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> government vying for legitimacy with a rival Moslem cabinet, clamped a blockade on illegal ports run by Moslem militias south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in a bid to restore long-eroded state authority. The <ORGANIZATION> Druse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> retaliated by shelling the Christian enclave. They soon were joined by the Syrians, who maintain 40,000 troops in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate. `` The observer force will not be a deterrent one, but rather a symbolic force assigned to oversee a cease-fire,'' <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. The truce would be an interim step aimed at stabilizing the situation in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> until a political solution is worked out, with provisions for arranging presidential elections and the formation of a a coalition government. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has said it will attend the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> meeting.

 Scientists at an Indian laboratory have achieved nuclear fusion in an electrolytic cell, a process first reported by two <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> researchers in March, an Indian researcher said. The experiment at the <ORGANIZATION> Indira </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gandhi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in this city on the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION> 40 miles south of <LOCATION> Madras </LOCATION> differs slightly from the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> work. <PERSON> Cherian </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathews </PERSON> said in an interview that he and two associates achieved the `` cold fusion'' April 16 after three days of experiments. He said the team used titanium cathode and platinum anode dipped in so-called heavy water, which contains a form of hydrogen called deuterium that has a neutron in its nucleus. The <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> researchers had used a cathode made of a palladium, a highly expensive element, to achieve cold fusion. Cold fusion aims at getting the deuterium atoms to fuse, forming helium and releasing energy. The reaction occurs at room temperature and hence is called cold fusion. Previously fusion had been achieved under extremely high temperature and pressure, as seen in the core of the sun. <PERSON> Mathews </PERSON> said his team experimented with ordinary water and heavy water. He said there was a significant increase in temperature -LRB- heat -RRB- during the experiment with heavy water, as compared to ordinary water. That suggests that the reaction involved nuclear processes, such as fusion, rather than chemical processes. Heavy water and ordinary water are chemically identical. The team did not measure the energy output. But <PERSON> Mathews </PERSON> said they had rough estimates of energy during the different experiments. He did not give details. The team also noticed an increase in the number of neutrons emitted but these could not be reproduced at will, he said. <PERSON> Mathews </PERSON>, 50, said he had worked with <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> after receiving a doctorate from <ORGANIZATION> McMaster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Court Tosses Out Dispute Over Lotteries in Minnesota Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, by a 6-3 vote, today tossed out a dispute over the federal government's power to ban newspapers from publishing lists of winners in privately run lotteries. The justices ruled that a controversy from <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> has become moot because the government no longer intends to enforce the ban. `` We conclude that there is no longer any live controversy on the issue of whether the -LRB- challenged -RRB- statute is constitutional as it applies to prize lists, and that this appeal is moot,'' the court said in an unsigned opinion. Justices <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> cast dissenting votes but did not explain why. Justice <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, in a brief dissenting opinion, said the court should have reversed _ not merely set aside _ a federal judge's ruling that had upheld the publishing ban. The <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> originally challenged a postal law that bars newspapers from carrying advertisements and prize lists. Postal laws currently prohibit use of the mails to disseminate information about any lottery not run by a state. Since nearly all newspapers rely on the mail for at least a portion of their distribution, the postal laws apply to them. But after the justices agreed last October to study the case, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> enacted a new law, to take effect in May 1990, dropping the ban on advertising for private lotteries. The newspaper association and the government agreed to drop that part of the case. Government lawyers then told the justices that the existing ban on publishing prize winners will not be enforced. The dispute had focused on lotteries and other gaming, such as bingo and raffles, sponsored by non-profit, charitable organizations and others. Lawyers for the <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> newspapers said, `` The revenue generated by charitable gaming is very substantial. In <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> alone it appears to exceed $ 200 million per year.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Magnuson </PERSON> upheld the ban on lottery advertising even though he acknowledged that the ads are a constitutionally protected form of commercial speech. The newspaper association appealed. The judge, however, ruled that newspapers can not be barred from running lists of private lottery winners unless such lists are found in advertisements. The government had appealed that part of his ruling. The case is <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, 87-1956.

 <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> courts jailed 25 people and fined 18 who took part in a protest against the violent crackdown on demonstrators in the Soviet republic of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, an activist said today. <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Mityunov </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> said in a telephone interview that most of the jail sentences ranged from seven to 15 days, and that other protesters were fined between $ 160 and $ 480. They were arrested during a demonstration Sunday on <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s Pushkin Square The rally was called by the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, which bills itself as an alternative to the Communist Party. The official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday that 47 people were arrested, but the daily <ORGANIZATION> Moskovskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> reported today that more than 70 people were arrested. In court cases completed by midday today, <ORGANIZATION> Moskovskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> said, seven people were warned, 13 were fined and 15 received administrative punishments. It did not specify what the administrative punishments were, but many were likely to be brief jail sentences handed out for violating rules of the Soviet administrative code. In addition to the 25 jail sentences and 18 fines, <PERSON> Mityunov </PERSON> said six people were warned and that it was uncertain what happened to eight others. He said one resident of <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> had been sent back to the Ukrainian capital. There was no explanation for the discrepancies between <PERSON> Mityunov </PERSON>'s figures and those published by <ORGANIZATION> Moskovskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION>. Thousands gathered at the square in central <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Sunday even though the demonstration was banned and authorities warned they would arrest protesters. The rally lasted several hours and a special <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> police force waded into the crowds to seize some protest leaders. Hundreds of people then marched about a mile from the square to the Arbat pedestrian mall where they held a memorial meeting for those killed in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. Nineteen civilians were killed in a clash between soldiers and demonstrators on April 9 in the Georgian capital, <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>, and one young man was later shot and killed for a curfew violation. Officials in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> condemned the crackdown and the party leaders in the republic were ousted and replaced. Officials revealed that some of the victims of the clashes were killed by a gas used against demonstrators. In <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>, the Georgian minister of health pledged today to pressure military authorities to reveal the type of gas used. <PERSON> Irakli </PERSON> <PERSON> Managarishvili </PERSON> told reporters an investigation by military prosecutors into charges a poisonous gas was used was ordered by Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. Doctors say some gas victims are suffering from paralysis of the central nervous systems. Several dozen of the approximately 105 patients still hospitalized in the Georgian capital after inhaling the gas signed a letter Monday to President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> appealing for an antidote.

 An explosion triggered by a gas leak ripped through the fifth floor of an apartment building this morning, killing one man and injuring 12 other people, officials said. Firefighters said the force of the blast in suburban Collegno hurled debris dozens of yards from the building and damaged nearby parked cars. It destroyed one fifth-story apartment and seriously damaged the floors above and below it, they said. One man was found dead in an elevator, authorities said, and 12 other people were injured, including a man hit by flying debris as he waited at a bus stop.

<TEXT>
 The Communist Party today accused a small group of students of conspiring to undermine the government by stirring unrest, and officials warned workers not to shut down factories in sympathy with the protesters. Students at <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> universities today boycotted classes for a second day to appeal for democracy, freedom of speech and press, and talks with the government. The boycott began Monday after a week of street demonstrations sparked by the April 15 death of former <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON>, an advocate of reform. Tens of thousands of students from more than a dozen universities have taken part. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> blamed the unrest on `` a handful of students with ulterior motives. `` This is a planned conspiracy, an upheaval, that in essence aims at negating the leadership of the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the socialist system,'' the paper said in an editorial broadcast today on national television and radio. The editorial was the strongest warning yet that government tolerance of the students was nearing an end. It said conspirators had used `` the grief of students to fabricate rumors in an attempt to create greater unrest. `` This is a grave political struggle facing the whole party and the people of all nationalities.'' It called on the nation to unite against public disturbances and protect `` hard-earned political stability.'' The broadcast of the editorial was played repeatedly over loudspeakers at several major universities. `` This is their first step. We can expect arrests to come soon,'' said one student activist at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Students and residents of the district where most of the strike-bound universities are located reported troops from outlying counties had moved into the area in preparation for an eventual crackdown. Informed sources said more than 10,000 troops had been brought in. The official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said late today that government officials had arranged a meeting with student representatives at <ORGANIZATION> Qinghua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, where most of the more than 10,000 students are boycottng classes. But it said students failed to show up and officials were told they had been unable to agree on who would represent them. The incident appeared to reflect a growing division among students who want to reduce tensions and those who want to hold more large-scale marches and rallies. Most students want to continue the protests in some form until May 4, the 70th anniversary of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s first pro-democracy student movement. `` The divisions are not serious,'' said one student leader. But poster boards at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> were plastered with pleas for unity. `` If we return to class, we will be condemned by the ages, we will be the scum of Chinese history,'' said one poster. `` Please remember ... We are writing history.'' Students leaders sent activists to street corners to give speeches explaining their demands for a free press, respect for human rights and an end to official privileges and corruption. Many also are calling for senior leaders such as Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> to resign. `` Most workers are sympathetic to the students, but they do n't dare take part,'' said a worker who used his lunch break to go hear taped speeches by <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students just outside the campus He said his factory and others were given orders to keep workers in line, but that the main obstacle was fear of losing their wages. `` The students have no responsibilities, but what can I do?'' he said as he held his small son. `` If I stop working what will my child eat?'' The students' condemnation of official corruption has appeal to many workers because profiteering on the sale of raw materials has become a major business for many factory officials. The students also have won sympathy among journalists, whose state-controlled publications have been barred from publishing news of the class boycott. Only two newspapers have mentioned the student marches for democracy, and one, Science and Technology Daily, managed to get its edition to the streets only after the reporters threatened to quit en masse.

 <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> today outlined $ 10 billion in <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget cuts and said the `` hard choices'' included reductions in dozens of weapons systems and a $ 1 billion slash in Star Wars research money. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, making his first appearance as defense secretary before his former colleagues in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that only the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> had been spared manpower cuts. `` No program was excluded from consideration during the budget adjustment process,'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel at the start of what was expected to be a day-long hearing. `` But my top priorities are quality people, forward strategy, readiness and sustainability, efficient procurement and strategic modernization. The adjustments we made to the budget were implemented within this context.'' Under the budget agreement reached earlier this spring between the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> is required to cut future spending plans by $ 10 billion for the next fiscal year. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said that in making the budget changes, `` not only did we have to make hard choices, but we also had to make sure that they were the right choices.'' Funding for Star Wars research has been cut by $ 1 billion to a new total of $ 4.6 billion for fiscal 1990, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> would retire or transfer to the reserves one aircraft carrier, seven destroyers and 10 frigates, and that the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> would lose its new F-15E ground-attack jet and delay production of the new B-2 stealth bomber. The Army has been told to cancel production of AH-64 Apache helicopters after fiscal 1991. The <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> has been told to scrap development of its new V-22 transport aircraft. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has been ordered to defer some purchases of the F-A-18 jet fighter and to cancel its planned last purchase of an SSN-688 nuclear attack submarine. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, who took office a month ago, said he had ordered a cut in active military strength totaling 16,800 positions, down to a total of 2,121,500. Of those cuts, 8,000 will come from the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, 5,600 from the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, and 3,200 from the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, the defense chief said. A request for a 3.6 percent pay raise in fiscal 1990 for armed services personnel has been left intact, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said, and training funds would not be cut. On the nuclear-missile question, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had decided to move ahead with two kinds of mobile, strategic missiles _ the larger, 10-warhead MX missile and the single-warhead Midgetman. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> had recommended moving the nation's 50 MX missiles from silos to deployment on railroad cars rather than developing the Midgetman. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> opted for quick deployment of the MX and research-and-development funding for the Midgetman. `` Further development of the Midgetman wastes funds that are sorely needed for other defense programs,'' Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said of the compromise decision But Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said he had no problem with the plan. `` The main thing is to preserve and protect the assets we've got, which is MX in silos, and then go forward and make them mobile. Congressional Republicans over the years have favored the MX while many Democrats prefer the Midgetman. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, a backer of the compromise proposal, said it was his opinion that the plan `` will move through the <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> reasonably smoothly,'' because of its bipartisan support. The <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> said the MX-Midgetman plan has the support of Democrat <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION>'s recommendation for Star Wars spending of $ 4.6 billion compares to a total of $ 5.9 billion proposed by former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. In total, spending for <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION>, formally known as the Strategic Defense Initiative, would be $ 33 billion over five years, compared to the $ 40 billion proposed by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` The Star Wars funding level is keeping pace with the technology that's moving now in several directions,'' said Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said the spending proposal for Star Wars `` is not going to be such a cut that it will permanently wreck the program. It still gives a viable, reasonable program, particularly if they do n't press for early deployment.'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said the focus of Star Wars will shift from deployment sometime in the 1990s to research on `` Brilliant Pebbles,'' a more advanced system consisting of thousands of orbiting satellites. The defense secretary also said the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> would delay work for one year on the B-2 stealth bomber, which at recent estimates of $ 500 million per plane makes it the most expensive aircraft in history. Original plans called for purchasing 132. `` The stretch-out on the B-2 is not that bad in that it was going to slip some anyway for technical reasons,'' said <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON>.

 A hijacker with explosives strapped to his back blew himself up after failing to force a domestic Chinese airliner carrying 50 people to fly to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> news agency reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said two passengers were injured in the explosion during Monday's attempted hijacking on a flight from <LOCATION> Ningbo </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Zhejiang </LOCATION> province to <LOCATION> Xiamen </LOCATION> in the neighboring eastern province of <LOCATION> Fujian </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Ningbo </LOCATION> is about 490 miles north of <LOCATION> Xiamen </LOCATION>. It said the hijacker, who was carrying a pass from the journalism department of a university, stabbed an airline hostess in the hand before charging into the cockpit and demanding to be flown to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>New Contracts Show Further Evidence Of Wage Gains</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Contracts settled through collective bargaining in the past three months provided workers average annual pay raises of 3.1 percent during the life of the pacts, the government said today. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report provided additional data suggesting the rate of wage gains was picking up and placing inflationary pressures on the economy. The 3.1 percent annual increase in wages won in contracts settled in the first quarter of 1989 contrasted with a 2.5 percent average for the 12 months ended March 31, indicating wage inflation has accelerated in the past three months. The first-quarter settlements covered 199,000 workers, about 11 percent of the approximately 1.8 million workers whose contracts were settled through collective bargaining in the past year. Although the report showed signs of recent wage acceleration, the rate of average wage gains during the life of the contracts was down for both those contracts settled in the past three months and those settled in the past year. The 3.1 percent average annual wage gains negotiated in the first quarter compared with a 3.5 percent average annual increases the last time parties to those contracts negotiated, the government said. For 12-month period, the 2.5 percent average annual wage gains during the life of new contracts compared to 2.7 percent in the prior contracts. Eleven percent of the workers whose contracts were settled in the past three months have a cost-of-living adjustment included in the pacts, but those workers generally received lower actual wage increases to offset expected <ORGANIZATION> COLA </ORGANIZATION> payments later. Workers in non-manufacturing jobs fared better than those in manufacturing in the first quarter, winning average annual raises of 3.3 percent compared with 2.3 percent in manufacturing.

<HEAD>Court Upholds law Imposing User Fees on Transporting of Hazardous
Liquids</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A unanimous <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today upheld a 1986 federal law imposing `` safety user fees'' on pipeline companies that transport natural gas and hazardous liquids. The court reversed the ruling of a federal magistrate in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> that the law, that allows the secretary of transportation to impose user fees to pay for pipeline safety programs, unconstitutionally gives the executive branch too much of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' power to impose taxes Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> wrote for the court that the law clearly is not an `` unconstitutional delegation of the taxing power by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to the executive branch.'' The user-fee system is being used to pay for pipeline safety programs costing about $ 8.5 million to $ 9.3 million a year. The law had been challenged by <ORGANIZATION> Mid-America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a transporter of hazardous liquids. It has been assessed a $ 53,000 fee in 1986 by the secretary of transportation. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, ruled in 1987 that the assessments are taxes, and therefore the law improperly gives the transportation secretary the power to set tax rates. In her opinion today, however, <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said, `` We need not concern ourselves ... whether the pipeline safety user fees'' are really taxes. Assuming they are, she said, `` We hold that the delegation of discretionary authority under <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' taxing power is subject to no constitutional scrutiny greater than that we have applied to other non-delegation challenges.'' Had the court upheld the magistrate's ruling, its decision could have affected a broad range of federal fees and taxes. As examples, government lawyers cited congressional authorization for the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to assess nuclear power plant operators for licensing and inspection, and for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to impose fees to pay the cost of its various programs. The assessments may be based on the amount of pipeline miles a company operates, the quantity of natural gas or liquid and how far it is shipped, or the gross revenue of the company. The case is <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Mid-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, 87-2098.

<TEXT>
 A former fruit picker behind bars for two decades for the fatal poisoning of his seven children was railroaded, attorney <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> told a special court hearing today. The 21-year-old record of the case was `` skewed by the prosecutor and the sheriff in this county,'' said <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, who represented the former field hand, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, before Circuit Judge <PERSON> Clifton </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>. `` That file comprises the anatomy of a frame ...'' <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, lawyer and author who first alleged a frame-up in the 1971 book `` <LOCATION> Arcadia </LOCATION>,'' was the first of many attorneys scheduled to be heard. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, wearing a gray suit and dark, horn-rimmed glasses, was applauded by onlookers when he was brought in to sit at the defense table. `` It is not the purpose of the court to determine innocence or guilt,'' said <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, who was appointed by the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in March to hear the appeal. `` We are trying to find out whether there was a fair trial according to law ... but it is impossible to separate one from the other.'' The hearing was expected to last all day and possibly into Wednesday. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> previously has indicated he would like to rule immediately. If that happens, <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> could be released from prison promptly. It could be difficult for the state to retry a 21-year-old case. For months, the once-hearty fruit picker who is now a graying 53-year-old man has been inching toward freedom with evidence suggesting he did not poison his children to collect on a life insurance policy. Earlier this month, special prosecutor <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> said the 1968 conviction should be overturned because evidence was withheld and witnesses lied under oath with the prosecutor's knowledge. But the man who put <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> behind bars sees his possible release as a miscarriage of justice. `` I am just as convinced today of the defendant's guilt as I was 20 years ago,'' said former state attorney <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaub </PERSON>, who is suing <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> and attorney <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> for alleged defamation of character. Defense lawyers claim baby sitter <PERSON> Bessie </PERSON> <PERSON> Reese </PERSON> poisoned the children while <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mae </PERSON>, were working in citrus groves miles away. <PERSON> Reese </PERSON>, who is in her late 60s and is immobile in a nursing home, has confessed to nurses to the 1967 deaths, according to an affidavit from nurses. No charges have been filed against her and prosecutors have said she has become confused. In a 200-page document filed with the court, <PERSON> Schaub </PERSON>, 67, called for the conviction to stand. `` To really try to understand how a human being could kill those innocent, defenseless little children, we must first realize exactly who and what <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> really was, this 32-year-old man who had more than 10 children,'' <PERSON> Schaub </PERSON> wrote. He also listed charges that <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> refused to support his children, refused to work regularly, neglected the children, deserted his first two wives and their children and was arrested for minor crimes. Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> York </PERSON> said <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>'s character is not the issue. `` The question is whether he received a fair trial, and everyone deserves a fair trial,'' <PERSON> York </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, a black man convicted by an all-white jury in this southwest <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> farming community, was originally sentenced to death. That sentence was commuted to life in 1972. His lawyers said <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> was an easy target because he was illiterate, poor and black. They said prosecutors suppressed evidence that would have shown <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> had not yet purchased the insurance and that a cellmate of <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>'s has recanted statements that he heard <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> confess. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> was transferred Sunday from the <ORGANIZATION> Tomoka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> to the county jail in <LOCATION> Arcadia </LOCATION> so he can attend the hearing. If freed, <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> would visit the graves of his children then return to <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> for a shrimp dinner. <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said he has found a job and housing in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> for <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, who has learned recently about contemporary technology such as television remote controls and telephone answering machines. `` I wo n't believe it until I am free,'' he said in a recent interview at the prison. `` I've been promised freedom too many times before.''

<TEXT>
 Transport Secretary <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> has announced improved airport security measures following the bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103. He told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Monday the measures include examination of radios and computers and planned use of a thermal neutron analysis machine for bomb detection at <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gatwick </LOCATION> airports. More airport security inspectors would be employed and the government would give more money for research into detecting explosives. <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> said he would discuss the thermal neutron analysis machine being developed by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> in talks this week with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>. British press reports say the machines cost $ 850,000 each. <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> said under the new measures, all hold baggage on high risk flights is being screened and aircraft design changes are being carried out to make it more difficult to hide arms or explosives. `` This package represents a concerted effort to tighten up security. The aim is to give passengers and air crew a high level of security,'' <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> told reporters later. New York-bound Flight 103 blew up over <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, on Dec. 21, 1988, killing all 259 people aboard and 11 on the ground. The flight originated in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, changing planes at <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION>. Investigators say a bomb in a portable radio in the hold destroyed the plane.

 Newspapers should take advantage of technology to stay close to their readers, <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. President <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Batten </PERSON> told publishers gathered today for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> convention <PERSON> Batten </PERSON>, chief executive officer of Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` If newspapers are going to be as successful in the future as they've been in the past, we have to be much more zealous about getting close to our customers and staying there. Technology can help us do that. `` Used intelligently, the telephone and the computer can let us recreate the kind of personal relationships that newspapers had with their customers 20 or 25 years ago.'' For example, he said, the Providence -LRB- <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION> -RRB- Journal-Bulletin uses a voice service to offer telephone recordings of soap opera updates, publishing a daily access code for readers to call. The Journal reported more than 20,000 calls a month. In <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Boulder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Camera </ORGANIZATION> gets more than 77,000 calls a month on a system that offers recordings of sports scores and stories. The call-in systems are relatively inexpensive, requiring little more than a personal computer, phone lines and tape recordings, <PERSON> Batten </PERSON> said during a session on the convention's second day. It ends Wednesday. In addition, the industry has little choice but to change in dealing with the aging of the baby-boom generation, an increase in two-income households and the growing cultural diversity of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population, he said. `` These are threats, not to our existence but to our pricing flexibility, to our ability to finance the news coverage that our communities deserve and that we want to provide,'' <PERSON> Batten </PERSON> said. `` We can respond to those threats ... we can do that by using technology to take some modest steps that will bring us closer to the customer who keeps our business going _ the reader.''

<TEXT>
 Teen-agers accused of beating and raping a jogger joked about the assault when first jailed, but now some of them reportedly have been angrily taunted by fellow inmates at a juvenile center. A grand jury has begun hearing evidence against eight teen-agers, age 14 to 17, charged with beating and raping a 28-year-old woman, an investment banker who remains in a coma. `` It could have been my mother. It could have been my sister,'' a counselor at <ORGANIZATION> Spofford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Juvenile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> quoted residents as yelling at one of the accused youths, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported today. Officials said the suspects were no longer laughing and joking. `` They're really, really quiet and scared,'' the newspaper quoted another <LOCATION> Spofford </LOCATION> worker as saying. The victim was attacked the night of April 19 while she ran alone on an isolated stretch of road in Central Park. She was unconscious for about four hours before passersby spotted her. Doctors say she probably will live but they are worried about brain damage that may have occurred while she lay unconscious for four hours.

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is considering a proposal from its chairman that would force savings and loan owners to back their lending with more of their own capital. According to a draft document circulated among committee members and obtained Monday by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, is offering a plan with moderately stricter capital requirements than the bill passed earlier this month by the subcommittee on financial institutions, chaired by Rep. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON>, D-Ill. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>' committee is scheduled to hold its first public session on the bill Wednesday, after a private meeting of committee Democrats today Both <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>' plan and the subcommittee's bill include a risk-based formula for capital that offers a break to S & amp; Ls making low-risk loans such as home mortgages. But the <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> proposal would require most S & amp; Ls to maintain a somewhat higher base of `` tangible'' or `` real money'' capital, which includes cash and assets readily convertible to cash. The subcommittee's bill provides for a base of tangible capital of $ 1.50 for every $ 100 in loans, while another $ 1.50 could consist of `` goodwill,'' an intangible asset representing the value of an institution's customer loyalty and name recognition. Together, they amount to `` core'' capital of 3 percent. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>' plan also provides for core capital of 3 percent, but it's tougher on goodwill, allowing it make up only one fourth, rather than one half, of the core. Both the <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> and subcommittee legislation represent advances over current rules, which do not require owners to put up any real money if they have enough goodwill and subordinated debt _ money <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls borrow _ on their books. As of the end of 1988, goodwill was the biggest loophole, accounting for a third of the industry's $ 60 billion in capital. Subordinated debt amounts to about $ 4 billion. S & amp; L industry critics are targeting goodwill because it can not be sold when an institution closes. The subcommittee bill would allow <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls to maintain goodwill on their books, in some cases for as long as 40 years. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> would eliminate it in 20 years. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration had wanted to get rid of it in 10 years. The <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>' plan is also stricter with risky activities conducted in S & amp; L subsidiaries, such as investment in commercial real estate and junk bonds. It gives S & amp; Ls five years to come up with extra capital to back the subsidiaries, while the subcommittee plan does n't require extra capital. In another change, <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> would move back the deadline for complying with the new capital rules, from the June 1, 1990, target in the subcommittee bill to the June 1, 1991, originally proposed by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, one of the top-ranking Republicans on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, is pressing for even stricter capital requirements, calling the 1.5 percent tangible rule `` absolutely utterly insane.'' `` We have made a prescription for repetition of the problem and I think the country ought to be alarmed,'' <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> forum. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 91-8 to approve its version of <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L legislation last week. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, praising the vote in a speech in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to the annual meeting of The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` I urge the House to act promptly, and pass this S & amp; L reform bill with its central provisions intact.''

<HEAD>Treatment Could Revolutionize Organ Transplants</HEAD>

<DATELINE>STANFORD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A treatment that could revolutionize organ transplants by overcoming the rejection of foreign tissue and improving the quality of patients' lives is showing promising results, researchers say. The treatment, which could eliminate the lifelong need for highly toxic drugs to fight organ rejection by the body's immune system, may be ready for human studies within three years, said Dr. <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Fathman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor of medicine. The approach uses three doses of tailor-made, laboratory-grown monoclonal antibodies before the transplant to temporarily `` blind'' the immune system and keep it from recognizing the new organ as foreign tissue and attacking it. Rats given the treatment before receiving transplanted hearts have survived for more than 200 days without signs of rejection and without any anti-rejection drugs. Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Flavin </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> department of cardiovascular surgery, was scheduled to present the findings today at the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transplantation </ORGANIZATION> meeting in <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, the first full year of mandatory reporting of organ transplants by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hospitals shows 12,798 of the procedures were performed around the country in 1988, according to the national transplant network. The statistics, released Monday, were compiled by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sharing </ORGANIZATION>. Medical centers have been required since Oct. 1, 1987, by federal law to report transplants to the Virginia-based network. There were 9,123 kidney transplants, according to the network data. There also were 1,680 liver transplants, 1,647 heart transplants, 243 pancreas transplants, 74 heart-lung transplants and 31 lung transplants. Twenty-one of the lung transplants involved a full set of lungs and 10 involved single lungs. The monoclonal antibody treatment effectively paralyzed the rat immune system by killing certain cells while surgeons implanted hearts from donor rats into the abdomens of other rats with mismatched tissue type, leaving the recipients' original hearts intact. The drugs a patient must take to prevent the immune system from attacking a transplanted organ also prevent the immune system from attacking other harmful diseases. Patients then are susceptible to infections and may suffer other problems related to the drugs' toxicity The antibody treatment takes a new approach to the problem by creating a `` transient window of immunosuppression,'' said co-research, Dr. <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Shizuru </PERSON>. The antibody wipes out the specific type of white blood cells, called CD4 T lymphocytes, that lead the attack on the foreign organ, she said. But only mature cells are killed. Immature T cells are protected inside the thymus gland and begin repopulating in the body a few weeks after the transplant. `` We're sort of fooling the immune system for awhile,'' <PERSON> Fathman </PERSON> said. `` We're wiping the blackboard clean by removing the -LRB- mature -RRB- T cells that have not yet come into contact with the foreign antigen, in this instance the transplant,'' he said. By transplanting the new organ at a time when those cells are absent, the T cells repopulating from the immature cells in the thymus apparently do not recognize the transplant as anything except `` self,'' he said. When the T cells grew back, the immune system appeared to be `` blind'' to the foreign transplanted organ. But the T cells maintained their `` memory'' and attacked other foreign tissue. `` If the same thing holds in man, and we can prove that immunologic memory is not impaired by this type of immune paralysis, then we would be very hopeful that this technique could be readily applied to man,'' <PERSON> Fathman </PERSON> said.

 By her count, Dr. <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> performed 40,000 abortions over a half-century, all during a time when the practice was illegal. Police raided her clinic again and again. She served two terms in the county jail, one term in the state prison, but insisted always, `` I never really broke the law.'' She died in 1969, never living to see the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> decision, which changed the law to give women a constitutional right to an abortion Now, the high court is considering a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> case that could change the landmark abortion ruling. On the eve of Wednesday's opening arguments in the case, people who knew <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> remembered the doctor and her crusade To some, she was `` Ruthless <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON>.'' To others, especially her patients, she was an angel of mercy. At age 16, <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> became pregnant and had an abortion. In her 1969 book, `` They Weep At My Doorstep,'' she told about breaking the news of the pregnancy to her boyfriend. `` He was sympathetic at first, then resentful. He was not to blame, he said ... ` You got yourself that way, now get yourself out of it.''' The experience persuaded her to learn a method practiced by one of the first female surgeons in the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, Dr. <PERSON> Alys </PERSON> <PERSON> Bixby </PERSON> <PERSON> Griff </PERSON>. <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> was trained to perform abortions, and in 1932 she was certified as a doctor of naturopathy. She developed her code of ethics: Every woman had the right to choose a safe, sanitary abortion over an unwanted pregnancy. `` Helen'' was 18 when she went to see <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> in 1946. Today, she's a grandmother. `` I wonder in God's name what would have happened to me without Dr. <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON>. I was so determined,'' said the woman, who spoke on condition that her real name not be revealed. She learned of <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> through a girlfriend. Her boyfriend gave her $ 400 for the abortion. `` Never at any time was I ambivalent,'' she said. `` It was no choice, not pro-choice. ... It was a sobering event, I did n't take it lightly. To me, it was immoral to get married because you were pregnant.'' <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> married her boyfriend and together had two children, `` both welcome, both planned,'' she said. <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON>'s practice flourished during the Depression and through World War II, when many women joined the workforce. But in the 1950s, police began to crack down on <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>'s abortion clinics Police were helped by The <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>'s ace investigative reporter <PERSON> Rolla </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crick </PERSON>. <PERSON> Crick </PERSON> said in an interview that in 1951 he and a policewoman posing as his pregnant girlfriend made the rounds of the clinics. They gave their findings to the district attorney. On July 6, <PERSON> Crick </PERSON>'s byline appeared under a banner headline, `` POLICE CRACK DOWN ON ABORTION NESTS.'' <PERSON> Crick </PERSON> told how police `` thundered at the doors of half a dozen suspected abortion mills in simultaneous raids.'' Partially clad women ran screaming from the premises as suspected abortionists were hauled into jail. Six people, including <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON>, were charged with manslaughter of fetuses by abortion and maintaining a public nuisance as a result of the raids. There were no figures on the number of women injured or killed by illegal abortions, <PERSON> Crick </PERSON> said. `` There were some deaths, but not wholesale deaths,'' he said. `` Some women said they wished they had n't -LRB- had abortions -RRB-. Others said, ` Hey look, it's nobody's business,''' he said. `` A lot of women were ending up unable to have children because of botched abortions. It was protecting women against themselves,'' he said of the raids. He said he remembered that <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> ran a clean operation and her work was respected by the medical community. <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> herself claimed 70 percent of her patients were referred by doctors. <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> was flamboyant, often dressing like a showgirl in furs and fancy jewels. Detractors claimed <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> performed abortions for the money. But others said she performed many abortions for free. During her career, she made $ 9 million, but with her resources exhausted by high living and legal fees, she died at age 77 with less than $ 15,000. Only when she was dying of cancer in the <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> Women's Correctional Center did she agree not to perform another abortion

 A man in southern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> said Tuesday a mango tree in his garden has borne a fruit with an Islamic inscription on its skin, and crowds were flocking to the site, news reports said. <PERSON> Haji </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Multani </PERSON> said the inscription on the unripe mango was in Arabic and read `` La Ilaha Illallah'' _ `` There no God but <PERSON> Allah </PERSON>,'' according to Press Trust of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>.

The inscription has grown with the fruit, a Hyderabad-based journalist said by telephone, quoting <PERSON> Multani </PERSON>.

The other two mangos were normal, he said. After the fruit is ripe, <PERSON> Multani </PERSON> said he might give it to a museum.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today announced his intention to nominate <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, a black Republican critic of affirmative action, as the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s civil rights chief, setting up a potentially bruising <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation fight. The previously announced opposition to <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> by the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest civil rights group, could energize liberal opposition to the nominee. <PERSON> Benjamim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooks </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement Monday that <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> is not qualified to be the government's chief enforcer of civil rights laws. The White House formally announced <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>' selection as assistant attorney general in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s civil rights division in a one-sentence statement issued in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had spent the night. <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> had been pushed for the job by Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>. In a statement, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> called <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> `` a talented, decent and compassionate person whom I have known for a number of years.'' `` <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> is fully committed to the vigorous and fair enforcement of our country's civil rights laws and to removing barriers to equal opportunity for all our citizens,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. `` There are many positions for which Mr. <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> is eminently qualified in this administration,'' Hooks said. But the civil rights job `` is one of the most sensitive positions in government, as it relates to minorities, and we do not believe Mr. <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> is the person for this post.'' Hooks said the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> `` feels duty-bound to strive for the best qualified appointee for this most important position.'' People for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Way </ORGANIZATION>, a well-financed liberal lobbying group, also expressed reservations about <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> `` is someone with no track records and a lot of question marks,'' the group's president, <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kropp </PERSON>, said. `` The questions will have to be resolved before the civil rights community can support him,'' said <PERSON> Kropp </PERSON>, who heads a 270,000-member organization that helped defeat <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>'s nomination to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1987. Hooks said <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> lacks expertise to be the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s civil rights chief `` Each and every day this official must make crucial decisions of a highly technical and critical nature that demand specialized knowledge, based upon experience and background in this area,'' Hooks said. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Burstion-Wade </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement `` does n't change a thing for us.'' `` We're just disappointed that they chose to ignore not only his more than 35 years of public service but also his commitment to enforcing the civil rights laws of the country,'' she said. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s `` support for <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> has been unwavering since the announcement of his recommendation to the president.'' She said <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s `` friendship and admiration for <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> spans a number of years.'' <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> has been criticized by some civil rights leaders since <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> revealed in February that he had urged <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to nominate him for the position. The <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> chapter in <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>' hometown of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> voted recently to oppose <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, though the city's <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> group decided not to oppose the nomination. The 61-year-old <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, a former sheriff and executive of <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, ran unsuccessfully as the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>'s nominee for <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> governor in 1986. A former Democrat, <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> has been considered for other federal positions in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. Civil rights leaders have cited <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>' record as sheriff to demonstrate their view that he is not qualified to run a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> division responsible for prosecuting local police for brutality. In 1976, <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> was held legally responsible by a federal appeals court for failure to investigate allegations that a prisoner was beaten while in the custody of sheriff's deputies. <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> says he was unaware of the allegations at the time, but the court found he had failed to institute training procedures to prevent brutality by his deputies. That same year, <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> was cited for contempt of court for failing to reduce overcrowding and improve conditions at the county jail. <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>' claim on an old resume that he served as an assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s civil rights division during the early 1960s also has sparked controversy. <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> actually worked as a legal assistant and resigned after he failed the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> bar examination. Criticism of <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> has been by no means universal among black civil rights leaders. The Rev. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, sent a letter to <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> praising <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>' selection and recently <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> expressed support for the choice. In addition, Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>, a black Democrat from <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, also expressed support for <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>. <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON> is a senior member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>.

 Even before <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s Super 7 lottery jackpot hit $ 100 million today, the frenzy over a North American record was getting to be a little too much for some state residents. It's not the money they mind. It's the out-of-staters. `` Go home, Marylanders!'' one man shouted out his car window Monday evening as he drove by the Case & amp; Keg in <LOCATION> Shrewsbury </LOCATION>, just across the border from <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, where about 200 people waited in line to buy $ 1 tickets. Would-be millionaires from <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> joined the queues at the beer distributorship, and at another store in <LOCATION> Shrewsbury </LOCATION>. The scene was repeated across the state as long lines and traffic jams formed around ticket outlets ahead of Wednesday's drawing At <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, the ticket line was 30 deep at lunchtime. <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> pilot <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Link </PERSON> flew from his home in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, to <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> to buy $ 25 worth of tickets for himself and $ 86 for friends and relatives. `` Seventy million dollars gets your attention real quick,'' he said, referring to an earlier estimate of the jackpot, `` and $ 83 million gets your attention even quicker.'' The jackpot began reaching record proportions after six straight drawings yielded no winning ticket. Last week's jackpot was for $ 46 million. Unclaimed, it grew to $ 62 million on Thursday and $ 70 million by the weekend. On Monday, lottery officials announced the drawing would be worth at least $ 83 million, based on ticket sales. Lottery spokesman <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said today that the jackpot had risen to $ 100 million. There was even an international flavor to the ticket-buying spree. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Thwaites </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, who was en route to <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, stopped for tickets in <LOCATION> Shrewsbury </LOCATION> after hearing of the jackpot from friends who live near Reading. `` It's been on the radio and TV up in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, but I did n't know the jackpot was this large,'' <PERSON> Thwaites </PERSON> said. `` I'm just buying a few tickets, nothing extravagant.'' <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Lienhards </PERSON>, who recently returned from nine years in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, took time off from house shopping to buy tickets. `` This is like a carnival, and people are having fun, talking about what they would do with the money,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Lienhards </PERSON> said. The world's richest lottery jackpot was <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gordo </LOCATION>, or `` the fat one,'' last December. The $ 159 million first prize was split by hundreds of people. The largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> jackpot to date was an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> prize of $ 69.9 million that was split by four players nearly two weeks ago. The largest single <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> lottery payout was $ 55.16 million won by a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> woman in her state's drawing in September. Super 7 players pick seven numbers out of a possible 80, having a 1 in 9.6 million chance of selecting a winning ticket.

 A woman suspected of being a witch was dragged from her hut, tied to a tree and then axed to death by her neighbors in an eastern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> village, police said Tuesday. <PERSON> Sonamoni </PERSON> <PERSON> Kisku </PERSON> was killed Sunday by <PERSON> Ganesh </PERSON> <PERSON> Soren </PERSON> and his brother, <PERSON> Meghraj </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Goaljoi </LOCATION>, about 155 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Calcutta </LOCATION>, police said. <PERSON> Ganesh </PERSON> <PERSON> Soren </PERSON> was arrested but his brother was at large, according to Police Chief Satyan Pal. It was the latest in several killings of women suspected of being witches in the predominantly tribal region of the state. The Santhal tribes believe many women, especially widows, have the power to heal the sick and cast evil spells. But Mrs. <PERSON> Kisku </PERSON>, 50, was married and had two sons, Pal said. He said <PERSON> Ganesh </PERSON> <PERSON> Soren </PERSON> believed Mrs. <PERSON> Kisku </PERSON> had cast an evil spell on his 6-year-old daughter, who had been ill since January. State Chief Minister <PERSON> Jyoti </PERSON> <PERSON> Basu </PERSON> said at least 20 women were killed in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION> in 1987 on suspicion of practicing witchcraft.

 A Soviet seaman who jumped ship into near-freezing water off the Danish coast was rescued and placed in a refugee camp, the naval command headquarters said Tuesday. The 26-year-old sailor donned a life-vest and jumped overboard Saturday from a Soviet civilian vessel heading north through the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Belt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> strait </LOCATION> on its way to the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, the command said. A passing Danish navy ship spotted the seaman and picked him up. He was turned over to police at the port of <LOCATION> Korsoer </LOCATION>, where he asked for political asylum. The man, who was not identified, was lodged in a refugee center to await a decision, the navy said.

 Immigration officials were waiting today for a break in bad weather to fly two asylum-seeking Soviets to <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> from a <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> island where they defected. The two sought political asylum on the island of Little Diomede on Sunday, hours before officials signed a protocol aimed at easing travel restrictions between <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION> gave the Soviets permission to stay on the island, and they spent the night in a National Guard Armory there. The defectors were being kept under tight security, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Stimpfle </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Nome </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> official who reached the island before the weather turned bad, said today. `` Everything is hush-hush. They've even got the armory windows blacked out with ponchos or something.'' Soviet officials are aware of the defections, but `` at this point we have no comment,'' said <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Dronov </PERSON>, a Soviet vice consul in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. The men were reported missing when the Soviet delegation prepared to leave the island by helicopter after a party following the signing ceremony. INS District Director <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said they were the first Soviet defectors in his 10 years with the agency in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. Their asylum requests will go to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for review before the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> makes a decision. The Soviet delegation came to <PERSON> Little </PERSON> <PERSON> Diomede </PERSON> to sign the protocol, which urged the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet governments to approve a border commission to handle visits by Eskimos between <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>. Eskimos would not need visas to make the trip. Gov. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> was supposed to take part in the ceremony along with his counterpart from the <PERSON> Magadan </PERSON> region of <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>. Fog and blowing snow prevented <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> from reaching the island, and the ceremony was conducted by telephone. The ceremony was held in conjunction with the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> Expedition, a skiing and sled dog journey from <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. The expedition consists of six Soviets and six Americans. Two of the Soviets and two of the Americans are Eskimos. Many Eskimo families were separated when the Soviets closed the border in the <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> at the onset of the Cold War in the late 1940s. The Soviet island of Big Diomede, three miles from <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diomede </LOCATION>, is a military installation. Eskimos who once lived there were relocated to the Siberian mainland in the 1950s.

 Anti-poaching officers in southern <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION> seized 127 elephant tusks worth $ 19,000 and arrested four people, a news agency reported. The tusks were seized near <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION>'s southern border with <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> while en route to the central Tanzanian town of <LOCATION> Iringa </LOCATION>, west of the port city <LOCATION> Dar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> es </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salaam </LOCATION>, according to the report Monday by the state-run <PERSON> Shihata </PERSON> news agency. <PERSON> Shihata </PERSON> did not say when the ivory was seized. Police said two suspects eluded capture. <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION> banned trade in ivory in 1986, but poaching continues. In the last 15 years, hunters, lured by ivory's soaring world price, have reduced <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION>'s elephants by about one-third to an estimated 100,000. Western wildlife officials say ethnic Somali tribespeople, or Shiftas, hired by private businessmen and corrupt government officials, are largely responsible for the slaughter of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s once flourishing elephant herds.

<TEXT>
 From prisons and re-education camps in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Chi </PERSON> <PERSON> Thien </PERSON> wrote of despair, of loved ones and of dreams of freedom. Through poetry, he found a way to let his thoughts escape from `` the swamplands'' where he spent nearly half his life. Human rights groups have conflicting reports on <PERSON> Thien </PERSON>'s fate, with some sources saying he died in jail and others suggesting he remains imprisoned. His plight has drawn attention of writers around the world, and now his works are part of an effort to highlight the risks writers take to express themselves. On Wednesday, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chapter of the PEN organization, a leading voice of international literary freedom, will honor <PERSON> Thien </PERSON> with one of two Freedom-to-Write awards. The other writer to be honored at the <ORGANIZATION> PEN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montblanc </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Literary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gala </ORGANIZATION> is identified only as `` an anonymous African woman.'' `` The very thought that that person is unable to be identified says so much about the importance of focusing attention on these writers,'' said author <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>, a member of <ORGANIZATION> PEN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. `` We ca n't even say which country in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> she is from because of the dangers she faces. That underlines the need for us to turn to these heroic people as symbols in the fight against the harsh treatment of writers in countries where people are a lot less free to write.'' In addition to $ 3,000 that the <ORGANIZATION> PEN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> will send to a friend or relative of each recipient, the group hopes to pressure <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> with a written request for <PERSON> Thien </PERSON>'s release and pleas from prominent writers. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> said freedom of expression is not just important to writers: `` In a world where we have writers who are not free, who are imprisoned and tortured for writing, what happens to the readers in these societies?'' He said promoting freedom of expression is especially important this year because of the controversy over <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s novel, `` The Satanic Verses.'' The book, considered blasphemous by many Moslems, ignited an international furor and led to calls for censorship and for <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s death. For <PERSON> Thien </PERSON>, imprisoned for 26 of his 55 years after opposing the Communist government, pushing for literary freedoms and writing articles critical of communism, poetry became a creative diversion to help him survive prison hardships and the emotional torment of captivity. According to reports from human rights groups, <PERSON> Thien </PERSON> burst into the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> in April 1979. He gave a staff member a collection of poems and a letter asking that they be published. Vietnamese guards arrested him. His poems have been translated into French and English, set to music and compiled in a book titled `` Flowers From Hell,'' which won the prestigious <LOCATION> Rotterdam </LOCATION> International Poetry Prize in 1985. `` When successful, it sounds like the depth of feelings from a man who has endured much pain but continued to dream and to hope for freedom,'' said <PERSON> Huynh </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanh </PERSON> <PERSON> Thong </PERSON>, who translated the poems into English. Thong is director of Vietnamese Studies Projects at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, where the book was published. The London-based human rights group <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> received reports that <PERSON> Thien </PERSON> had died in 1986. But sources in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> have told <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> since then that he is alive. There also have been reports that he is suffering from depression and is partially paralyzed.

 Hungry elephants broke out of a game reserve in search of food and killed four peasant squatters who were tending crops, news reports said Tuesday. Families from the minority <LOCATION> Tonga </LOCATION> tribe recently settled and planted crops on the edges of the Chirisa game reserve in the <LOCATION> Midlands </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Claudius </PERSON> <PERSON> Hove </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION>'s chief warden in the province.

 Federal officials today opened a hearing aimed at explaining how a cargo door was torn off a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet in February, killing nine passengers. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> began the four-day hearing with a statement that the testimony gathered would assist the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> in `` determining the probable cause and in making any recommendations to prevent similar accidents.'' But he said any conclusions would await a report issued later in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747's 800-pound, 9-foot-square forward lower cargo hatch was left at the bottom of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> after <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> Flight 811 lost part of its fuselage shortly after takeoff from <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. The door was located 85 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> and under nearly 17,000 feet of water. <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> has said efforts may be made to raise the door, which several experts say is the best chance of finding definitive answers for the cause of the accident. Investigators are debating whether a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> salvage mission this summer would be essential and worth the high cost. Officials for <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, and unions representing airline pilots and mechanics were expected to testify during the hearing. `` The board's full report will not be issued for several months, but recommendations to prevent any recurrence could come at any time,'' <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said in a news release. The plane was bound for <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, with 337 passengers and a crew of 18 on Feb. 24. At about 23,000 feet, the airplane experienced an explosive decompression following the loss of the cargo door. Nine people were sucked out, along with seats and luggage, when the door and part of the aircraft fuselage were swept away. Though two engines conked out, pilot <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> managed to land at <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> with no further loss of life. The 747-100 was one of the first jumbo jets built by Seattle-based <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>. The 13 people testifying were expected to discuss maintenance, inspection procedures and practices, human factors and details of a 1987 incident in which the cargo door on a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> 747 opened slightly during a flight from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. There has been speculation the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> cargo door may have broken free in an explosive decompression when the latching mechanism failed. Airline records indicated there had been recent problems with the door before the accident, including a faulty door seal and electrical problems requiring the door to be closed manually rather than electrically on several occasions. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> on March 3 issued an emergency order requiring all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines to reinforce within 30 days the relatively lightweight aluminum latch mechanisms with steel, so the doors would be less vulnerable to damage caused by improper closing. The cargo bay door is hinged at the top so it closes downward, with eight latching mechanisms along the bottom attached to the plane's frame. It also has a latching mechanism and a hook pin on each side. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> 747 remains at <ORGANIZATION> Hickam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> and will be returned to service after repairs are completed.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is trying to help <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> stamp out drugs by sending gun-toting inspectors to deliver arrest warrants along with drug-filled mail. `` In fiscal 1988, we arrested 425 people for distributing narcotics through the mail,'' inspector <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> said. `` In the first six months of this fiscal year, we have arrested 440 people.'' Unlike many government agencies which announce their total drug seizures with great fanfare, the postal inspectors are so low key about their work that the spokesman could n't come up with the total amount of illicit drugs they seized last year. Generally, however, because of the nature of the mail system, the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> does n't make large seizures that could compare with those by other agencies. `` In a boat or a container ship or an airliner, they can move tons in those kind of things,'' he said. `` In the mail you ca n't do that, at least not in an individual package.'' <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> declined to give too many details on the service's operations, saying, `` The bad guys read newspapers, too. But he said the service gets help from other agencies such as the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and local police while developing its own cases through informants and other tips. The service's recent finds include $ 8,000 worth of PCP packed in baby food jars and being mailed from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to Broken Arrow, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, and illicit steroids being distributed by two men in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> who were arrested April 17. Officials said the latter case _ which involved a two-year investigation by postal inspectors and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> _ was the largest illicit steroid ring ever busted. The Postal Inspection Service has no idea how much drugs are moving through the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mail system because it's illegal for the agency to inspect the mail without a federal warrant, he said. Yet, the service presumes the amount is increasing. `` There's a direct relationship between the amount of drugs in society and the amount being passed through the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> said. When one mode of transporting drugs is shut down, `` dealers find new avenues to move the narcotics.'' Of the 1,800 postal inspectors nationwide, some 800 do criminal investigations including mail fraud, child pornography and internal theft, he said. The number focusing full time on drugs doubled from 50 to 100 in the current fiscal year, <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> said Tuesday. And when a case comes along, other inspectors are put to work on it. `` We'll even bring them from across the country if the magnitude of the case calls for that,'' he said. The mailings are n't limited to any part of the country, he said. `` There are mailings from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. It's crazy.'' Private mail services such as <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parcel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> are not scrutinized as carefully as the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mail. Spokesmen for both companies said they cooperate with authorities on drug investigations, but neither would indicate exactly how often this has occurred nor whether the companies instigated any probes. The <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is cooperating with the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to clear mail from 29 high-risk drug source countries at the port of arrival, according to <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Shimkoski </PERSON> of Customs. In the first half of fiscal 1989, which began last October, Customs seized 65 pounds of heroin, 216 pounds of opium, 10 pounds of cocaine and 297 pounds of marijuana at the 21 international mail branches, he said. In fiscal 1988, Customs seized 164 pounds of heroin, 1,600 pounds of opium and 1,310 pounds of marijuana. There were no significant amounts of cocaine mailed, <PERSON> Shimkoski </PERSON> said.

 Syrian gunners firing giant mortars battled Christian forces in an ill-matched duel Tuesday that each accused the other of starting in an effort to sabotage a new Arab peace initiative. Police reported two people were killed and 16 wounded as artillery and rockets pounded the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> capital for six hours. The fighting shadowed a peacemaking effort by foreign ministers of the 22-state <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, who are to meet Wednesday in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>. Christian leader Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> was reported to have accepted a league proposal for 200 Arab observers to enforce and monitor a cease-fire. But the plan was jolted when Justice Minister <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> rejected having more foreign troops in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, where his staunch ally, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, has 40,000 troops under a 1976 league peacekeeping mandate. `` We do n't need more armies,'' <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> said Tuesday. His remarks are seen as a rejection by proxy of the Arab plan from <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s main power broker. <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> militia so far has taken no part in the fighting between <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s mainly Christian troops and an alliance of Syrian troops and Moslem Druse militiamen that outgun and outnumber the Christians. <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s foreign minister and architect of the Arab plan, left Tuesday for <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> declaring: `` We hope our <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> brothers will discern the interests of their people and country and stop fighting so that dialogue and wisdom replace shells and cannons.'' In <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> announced a plan to send its own forces to quell the fighting, but the plan is not expected to win much support. `` Observers say who is wrong and who is right. But to stop the killing of the people, we need real forces,'' said <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abderrahman </PERSON>. Earlier Arab attempts to halt the carnage have failed, as has a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> appeal Monday for an end to the battles that erupted March 8. Since then, at least 272 people have been killed and 991 wounded. Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> repeated his calls for peace Tuesday at a Mass in the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>, where he invited Lebanese clerics and families. The London-based <ORGANIZATION> Mideast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> newsletter quoted <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> as saying he will accept an Arab observer force `` as a first step'' toward a political solution `` so long as it does n't include any of the participants of the fighting.'' `` The ultimate objective ... remains ending the Syrian and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation of Lebanese territory,'' it quoted <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> as saying. Some Arab states support Christian demands that <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> withdraw because it has violated its mandate by shelling them. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> says it will not withdraw. Tuesday's random bombardment raged from midnight to daybreak, forcing tens of thousands of residents to shelter in underground bunkers. It later slackened into sporadic shelling. The Syrians hammered the east of the city, heart of the besieged 310-square-mile Christian enclave, with 240mm mortars and B-21 launchers that fire 40 122mm rockets in 20 seconds. <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> shook as <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s forces lobbed 155mm and 130mm howitzer and mortar shells into west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Ambulances with wailing sirens sped through rubble-strewn streets.

<HEAD>Trappings Go Back In The Closet, Horseshoes Come Out</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In his first 100 days, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> put the imperial trappings of the White House in storage. The place now rings with the squeal of grandchildren and the clang of horseshoes. Born to wealth and privilege, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> brought to the Executive Mansion the down-to-earth tastes and attitudes of a common person: hot dogs and baseball games, barbecues and country music, guided tours of the grounds, side trips to tourist attractions. Yet for all the bustle of the White House these days, the nation's 41st president often rides about town in a silent motorcade, politely stopping at red lights to avoid tying up traffic. Historians and political analysts may differ over the president's accomplishments in these first 100 days, but few will deny he's been enjoying every one of them. `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is sort of a <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> figure,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> whip, recalling the mix of aw-shucks naivete and stubbornness in the actor's characterization in the movie classic, `` Mr. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> Goes to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` The president's personal style is nice and warm and collegial. It's just the way he is. He's also a very tough man,'' <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said, adding, `` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was a star. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is more of a senior player-coach type.'' Riding the crest of 60 percent-plus approval ratings in public opinion polls, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is settling with obvious relish and comfort into the job that he long coveted. At the same time, he has eschewed efforts to compare him with his predecessor, who also scored high in the polls. `` I certainly know something about following a class act,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a recent audience. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> himself can joke that his first 100 days are `` about the same as <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Buren </PERSON>'s'' _ who was forced in his first 100 days to deal with one of the nation's worst financial panics and the long depression that followed _ and whose name the president enjoys invoking. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s constant-motion style gives aides and reporters a difficult time keeping up with him. Beginning work each day at 7 a.m., <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> routinely puts in 11-hour workdays in the Oval Office, although he also has been known to slip away in the middle of the afternoon to play tennis, jog, throw horseshoes or play racquetball in a congressional gymnasium. While he seldom held news conferences during his presidential campaign, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has met roughly once a week with reporters since taking office, in forums ranging from regular news conferences to small-group chats in the Oval Office. He's traveled to four foreign counties and 17 states in his first three months in office. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> set a populist tone on his first full day in office, opening the White House and its grounds to the public. And he's had a stream of visitors in ever since, among them Democratic leaders who got little such attention from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` I've been here more ... since <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been president than I was in eight years under his predecessor,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>. Congressional leaders who have met frequently with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> say he is a good listener at high-level meetings, but a tough negotiator. `` I am amazed at how much at peace with himself he is, and really knows where he wants to go, how he wants to do it,'' said his chief of staff, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has no trouble making quick decisions, even though the president himself jokes that `` People say I'm indecisive I do n't know about that.'' Aides and associates say he gives careful attention to detail, even checking travel manifests to make sure there are n't too many staff members on trips, while always keeping up to speed on the issues of the day. In addition to daily intelligence and national security briefings, he reads `` about five papers as far as I can see'' each morning, said his wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>. Participants at Cabinet meetings say the president often stays on the sidelines and lets others do most of the talking, while other times jumping in and vigorously leading the discussions. `` He enjoys the give and take,'' said Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. `` He enjoys having ideas put forward. ... He enjoys the competition of ideas and discussion of policy and where we ought to be going.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who as vice president had lunch once a week with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, has carried the custom forward. He eats a private lunch each Thursday with <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who said he has complete access to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and can go into his office any time he wants. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is `` a much more open, gregarious, outgoing president than we've had in a long time,'' said <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Ornstein </PERSON>, a political analyst with the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. `` His early reputation is that this is a president who makes things happen. Once you establish that reputation, you are going to carry it to your advantage for a long time.'' Still, others have trouble focusing on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s true political and policy identity in all the swirl of activity. `` The non-image is the image he has created for himself,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Griscom </PERSON>, who was <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s communications director. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, after all, is the president who begins speeches on education with the phrase, `` you know;'' who talks about `` things'' and `` stuff;'' who frequently stumbles over his own lines. `` It's been said that sometimes I do n't speak in very good English and that I have a hard time being understood,'' he told a White House audience the other day. `` I'll admit it, it's true. And all I can say is that I'm in pretty good company, though. Look at <LOCATION> Yogi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berra </LOCATION>.'' `` I love to quote Yogi,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, captain of <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION>'s 1948 baseball team, told another audience. `` He once said at a state dinner right here in this building, ` How could you get a conversation started in there? Everybody was talking too much.''' And if <PERSON> Berra </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> catcher who turned the language on its ear, is the baseball great that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> quotes the most, the one he admires the most is another <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION>, the low-keyed <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Gehrig </PERSON>, whom <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> calls his personal hero. `` He played in 2,130 straight games _ a record which still stands,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` But more than that, he was a good and decent man about whom a teammate said, ` Every day, any day, he just went out and did his job.'''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> today retired 74 senior members, including former President <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>, to make way for a renewal of the party's top policy-making body that likely will strengthen President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Party ideology chief <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> told a news conference the committee unanimously approved 110 requests for retirement by <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> members, non-voting committee members, and members of the party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revisions </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency transmitted a list of the retirees that included <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>, who retired as president last fall, former <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION> members <PERSON> Geidar </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Aliev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomentsev </PERSON> and former candidate Politburo member <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolgikh </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has complained opposition to his reform program exists within the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which has included many officials who gained membership before he became party leader in March 1985. <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> said 83 members, or more than one-quarter of the 300-member body, have lost the government and party jobs that entitled them to Central Committee membership. Western observers call that group the `` dead souls'' and say it can be a conservative presence on the Central Committee. Among those promoted to full <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> membership were <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Velikhov </PERSON>, the vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> who is believed to be a supporter of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>; <PERSON> Yuli </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kvitsinsky </PERSON>, an arms control expert who is ambassador to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Primakov </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> and International Relations. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> opened the meeting today with a speech on the party's program and local organizations, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said The full agenda of the one-day meeting was not disclosed, but <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said Monday that the issue of nationalities would not be the main topic of discussion. At least 20 people were killed in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> on April 9 when troops clashed with demonstrators demanding independence, and last year more than 90 died in the neighboring republics of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has said the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> will devote a summer meeting to policy toward the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s 100 ethnic groups. Today's meeting was the first Central Committee session since at least three dozen top officials across the country were defeated in parliamentary elections March 26. Among the losers were the premiers of <LOCATION> Lativa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, the mayor and party chief of <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> and the mayor and No. 2 party leader of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The defeats were particularly embarrassing for Communists who ran unopposed. Others lost as they faced opponents for the first time in the first multiple-candidate races in 70 years. The Central Committee has the power to oust members who were defeated in their parliamentary bids. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> portrayed the parliamentary elections for a new 2,250-seat parliament as a referendum on perestroika and said party and government officials lost because they `` were restructuring slowly.'' The Central Committee laid the foundation for perestroika, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s wide-ranging overhaul of the Soviet economy, political and social systems, in April 1985, six weeks after <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> became party chief.

<HEAD>Study Group Says OPM Appointees Often Hostile to Civil Service</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Former Presidents <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` made bureaucrat-bashing the norm'' and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s political appointees at the Office of Personnel Management were often hostile to the civil service, a congressional panel was told Tuesday. The congressional <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> received reports from task forces of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, a private organization that has recommended pay increases and other steps to make federal service more attractive. The commission's task force on recruitment and retention said in its report that the personnel management office, created by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1978, `` has not met early expectations and remains, in many ways, an agency in search of an identity.'' `` Although <ORGANIZATION> OPM </ORGANIZATION> operated for a brief time at the end of the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration, it was President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> who really shaped the early character of <ORGANIZATION> OPM </ORGANIZATION>,'' the task force said. It said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first appointee to head <ORGANIZATION> OPM </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Devine </PERSON>, `` took a political approach to both the position and the agency'' and more than quadrupled the number of political appointees, increasing them from eight to more than 32. `` Equally troubling is the fact that the political appointees to <ORGANIZATION> OPM </ORGANIZATION> were often actively hostile to the career civil service,'' the task force said. It charged that `` the organization's effectiveness was severely diminished'' by low morale among the remaining career employees. Rep. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dicks </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wash </LOCATION>., a co-chairman of the congressional task force, said, `` Clearly, the public's perception of the federal civil service has been influenced by negative messages from some elected officials in recent years, too many of whom have been willing to blame civil servants for the country's problems `` The previous two presidents made bureaucrat-bashing the norm,'' <PERSON> Dicks </PERSON> said. The commission task force said the appointment of <PERSON> Constance </PERSON> <PERSON> Horner </PERSON> as director of <ORGANIZATION> OPM </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 `` signaled a new direction'' for the agency, which in 1987 and 1988 `` paid serious attention to promoting the public service.'' `` There is consensus that <ORGANIZATION> OPM </ORGANIZATION> stands at the crossroads,'' the task force said. One of the commission's recommendations is a sharp decrease in the ratio of political to career appointees in the federal government. Rep. <PERSON> Steny </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyer </PERSON>, D-Md., also a co-chairman of the congressional task force, said that `` career executives have been driven off the leadership team in recent years, displaced by deepening layers of political appointees. `` This is a dangerous trend for the federal government,'' <PERSON> Hoyer </PERSON> said. `` Career executives help assure continuity as political appointees change.'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> chairman and chairman of the privately financed study group, said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` speaks clearly and spontaneously about the value of public service'' and `` I think that is an indication and a hopeful sign that attitudes in this area may be in the process of changing.'' The commission's recommendations, calling among other things for a 50 percent increase over two years in pay for senior federal officials, judges and members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, were submitted to the president March 29. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has recommended pay raises for judges, but has withheld recommendations on other increases.

 A woman condemned to death for bombing a South Korean airliner probably will be pardoned even if the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upholds her sentence, government officials said Tuesday. Confessed communist agent <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hui </PERSON> was convicted Tuesday and sentenced to death by a three-judge panel headed by senior Judge <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> <PERSON> Sang-hwak </PERSON>, who said her crime underlined <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s unchanging policy of destroying <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s freedom <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> has denied <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>'s assertions that North Korean leaders ordered her to bomb the Korean Air passenger plane in 1987. All 115 people aboard died when the plane disappeared over the <LOCATION> Andaman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> near the coast of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. `` We have an enemy which always tries to destroy our liberal democratic system. We must face that reality with resolute determination,'' <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> said in the verdict of the three-judge panel. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>, 27, wept and her shoulders heaved as he pronounced her guilty of violating national security and aviation laws and sentenced her to death. South Korean law gives <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> one week to appeal. <PERSON> Ahn </PERSON> <PERSON> Dong-il </PERSON>, her lawyer, said they have not yet decided whether to do so. Relatives of those killed sat quietly in the court, watching <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> as she stood before the judge with downcast eyes. She said nothing before being led away. `` She deserves death because she killed 115 people,'' <PERSON> Park </PERSON> <PERSON> Son-jin </PERSON>, 60, whose son was on the plane, said after the hearing. Hundreds of security agents and police surrounded the courthouse to prevent more angry protests by relatives, or a possible threat from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The judge said there is no doubt <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> planted the bomb aboard the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 707 that disappeared Nov. 29, 1987, on a flight from <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> has said she blew up the plane on orders from <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jong </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON>, son and heir of North Korean President <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON>, to disrupt the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Olympics. She has said she wants to die to atone for her sin. But South Korean officials said privately they expect she will be reprieved on grounds she was duped by <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and has repented. Court officials said if <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> is pardoned, she will be free on a stay of the sentence. Similar arrangements have freed other North Korean agents pardoned under a special amnesty after they switched loyalty. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> denies involvement in the bombing and claims it was engineered by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to embarrass the <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> government. The two nations have been bitter rivals since their land was divided in 1945. Testimony given by <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> corroborated the findings of bomb experts who said the plane exploded in less than a second. No bodies were found. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> has said she and another agent pretended to be Japanese tourists and planted the bomb, which was disguised as a radio and a liquor bottle. The two were arrested a few days later and tried to take cyanide hidden in cigarettes. The other agent, an elderly man, died.

 Three youths attacked <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> in an airport bathroom, cutting off some of his hair and painting a swastika on his head, said the controversial TV talk show host. `` They sieg heiled me when they left,'' <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> told television station <ORGANIZATION> KOFY </ORGANIZATION> after Monday night's incident at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> said one of the youths `` got me from behind, another got me around the neck, one sat on me.'' <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> said he was not injured and did not go to a hospital. He was in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> to promote his television show on <ORGANIZATION> KOFY </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think I kicked one of them,'' <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> said. `` At least I hope I did.'' Airport spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said police are investigating <PERSON> Downey </PERSON>'s report. He said officers and medical crews were called for help and found <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> already in the back of his limousine. A man who was in the restroom at the same time as <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> told investigators he did not see any confrontation, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. `` The only thing that he saw was he did see Mr. <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> walk briskly out of the restroom, assisted by a couple of young men who had been with him. They were friends of <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> who had traveled in the limousine with him.'' In an interview at his <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> hotel room early Tuesday, <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> said he thought his attackers were `` skinheads'' such as the young racists represented and reviled on <PERSON> Downey </PERSON>'s program. `` It's the skinheads, the same ones who have threatened me for so long,'' he said, discounting the chance his assailants were from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s gay community, which has been critical of his frequent tirades against homosexuals. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> KOFY </ORGANIZATION>'s news assignment editor, said only a small portion of <PERSON> Downey </PERSON>'s hair was cut. `` It looks like something a little kid would do to another little kid,'' he said. `` Kind of like a bald spot. I think it was done with scissors and the swastika was made with a marker pen.'' About the same time as <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> said the assault occurred, a bomb threat forced <ORGANIZATION> KOFY </ORGANIZATION> to go off the air during the time slot for the syndicated series `` The <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> Jr. Show.'' The nature of the threat was not explained. The show _ scheduled to begin at 11 p.m. _ returned at 11:35 p.m. The show was making its first appearance in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> since it was canceled last summer in response to protests by local gay activist organizations.

<DATELINE>VALDEZ, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Radio messages recorded the morning the <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> ran aground show the ship's captain spent up to an hour trying to rock the tanker free, a move the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> says could have sunk the ship. The transcripts were obtained in a Freedom of Information Act request by the <ORGANIZATION> Anchorage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, which published details today. The state of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> issued a new analysis saying 11.2 million gallons of oil spilled from the <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, rather than the 10.1 million originally estimated by <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>. Also today, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said 31 lawsuits and 1,300 claims ranging from $ 500 to $ 4 million have been filed against the company in the wake of the spill. At a meeting of security analysts in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> officials declined to put a total dollar value on the lawsuits or the claims. In other developments, millions of tiny salmon have been released into oil-tainted Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>, and wildlife officials were deploying fireworks, shotguns and other noisemakers to scare migrating birds to safety. Transcripts of March 24 radio messages between <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Commander <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> McCall </PERSON> and tanker captain <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> indicate the skipper tried to free the ship despite warnings the tanker might be unstable. In the first transmission, <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> informed the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> that he was aground, `` leaking some oil and we're going to be here for a while.'' The ship's logs indicate the ship ran aground on <LOCATION> Bligh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reef </LOCATION> some 23 minutes earlier. The delay in reporting and <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>'s position report are subjects of an investigation. <PERSON> McCall </PERSON> was rousted from bed to deal with the crisis, and contacted <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> for a situation report. `` We ` re working our way off the reef,'' <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> said. `` We've, ah, the vessel has been holed and we're acertaining, right now we're trying just to get her off the reef and we'll get back to you as soon as we can.'' <PERSON> McCall </PERSON> told <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> to take it `` slow and easy,'' and said help was on the way. `` Before you make any drastic attempt to get away, make sure you do n't, you know, start doing any ripping,'' <PERSON> McCall </PERSON> said. `` You got a rising tide ... I would n't recommend doing much wiggling.'' A conversation about 1 -LCB- hours after the first transmission indicated the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION>'s engines had stopped and apparently the effort to free the tanker had halted as well. There was no immediate indication whether trying to free the ship made the problem worse. The ship had at least eight major holes up to 24-feet in diameter. `` In my opinion, if it had slid off the reef it would have sunk,'' <PERSON> McCall </PERSON> said in an interview with the Daily News. With high winds and rough seas hampering the cleanup Monday for the second straight day, the focus was on wildlife as the state announced <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> had agreed to build a second otter rehabilitation center. The troop ship USS <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION>, meanwhile, arrived from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> to become a floating mobile base for up to 400 cleanup workers who will go out in small boats. The weather, with seas up to 18 feet, kept oil-skimming boats hugging the shore in the sound and the Gulf of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. But a fishermen's flotilla attacked encroaching oil off the southern tip of <LOCATION> Kenai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> near the mouth of <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Inlet </LOCATION>. The boats dragged nets, with absorbent material sewn into them, the way they would gather herring this time of year. They hoped to block a sheen of oil from fish-rich <LOCATION> Kachemak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Loren </PERSON> <PERSON> Flagg </PERSON>, a retired state biologist helping run the unsanctioned effort. `` We're making a last stand as far as getting fishermen involved,'' said <PERSON> Flagg </PERSON>. `` This bay is our priority. We'd like to see our effort institutionalized. We can get close to shores where the big skimmers ca n't.'' Proximity also was a factor in opening the second otter rehabilitation center in <LOCATION> Seward </LOCATION>, about 130 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> insisted there was adequate capacity at the Valdez center to handle otters found outside the sound. But the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> argued that transporting the otters to <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> would subject them to more stress, and diminish their chances of survival. Twenty-four million salmon fry have been released since late Sunday because a new plankton bloom made conditions in the sound as good as they will get. `` It's a little earlier than we expected,'' said <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarty </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Prince </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sound </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aquaculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which owns three hatcheries in the sound. `` It caught us a little by surprise. We really have no choice but to release them now.'' More were being released this week. Once the fish reach a certain size they can be harvested by fishermen, who pay fees to the hatcheries. With officials counting nearly 3,000 birds killed by the nation's worst oil spill and 15 million expected to arrive soon, the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish & amp; <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said it would begin its bird-hazing plan today. Crews planned to use propane cannons, shotguns loaded with special `` cracker'' shells, whistler bombs and bottle rockets to keep the arriving birds away from contaminated areas that have been prime nesting areas along the southern <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> coast. Reflective tape also was to be used to keep birds from landing in oiled areas.

 In his first 100 days, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> put the imperial trappings of the White House in storage. The place now rings with the squeal of xpediting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic and military aid and states: `` President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> personally authorized the entire plan.'' <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> testimony was in response to questions from subcommittee chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Obey </PERSON>, D-Wis., who asserted that his panel had been misled or lied to by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials when it sought to find out at the time whether foreign aid money was being indirectly used to help the Contras at a time when such aid was prohibited <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> said he had learned before coming to <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> that he would be asked about apparent discrepancies between the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> trial document and what administration witnesses had told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. He said he called the White House for guidance on how to respond before testifying. `` The whole proposed linkage that was included in -LRB- North's -RRB- plan was disapproved, was not made, there was no ` discreet emissary','' <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> said. In an admission-of-fact document prepared by <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers and the government, <PERSON> North </PERSON> `` linked a trip of the vice president that was planned well in advance of even the preparation of this plan, publicly announced, and which did occur, to a secret plan that was never appproved,'' <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> told the panel. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s talks with high-level officials, including Honduran President <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Suazo </PERSON>, never mentioned the quid-pro-quo link, he said. <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> said he has seen memos outlining the conversations, and `` they're not talking about conditionality of the type that -LRB- North -RRB- document implies.'' <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has been frustrated at not being able to comment on the 42-page document since it was introduced at North's trial on April 6. But he said he now could comment on the admissions because <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s jury is now sequestered and ca n't be swayed by his comments. He said the paper was suggested by Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>, who is presiding over the North trial, and prepared by <PERSON> North </PERSON> and his lawyers `` as an expedient way of managing the trial, avoiding classification issues, avoiding long argumentation and calling witnessess over material that might not be relevant to that trial.'' `` When I saw this thing, I started walking around my office shouting,'' he said. `` It was so distorted, so misleading ... But I was told that we had no role in being able to influence the content of this document, other than to ensure that no classified information was in there.''

 A major disagreement within <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> over disarmament overtures to the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> heightened Tuesday with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s insistence on superpower talks on short-range nuclear weapons despite a clear rebuff from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> and Defense Minister <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> returned from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> after a failed attempt to persuade the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of a need for talks on the short-range weapons. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials held out against the West Germans, citing fears that negotiations on the weapons could lead to their elimination and increase the threat from superior <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc conventional forces. West Germans, who in general believe the threat from the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact has been reduced, have become increasingly eager for the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> to speed up disarament talks with the Soviet bloc. Despite <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s refusal to budge, <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> said <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was sticking to its position and would continue discussions within <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> to resolve the stalemate. `` We are going into the talks with our partners with the same position that we have already worked out,'' <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> said. Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s conservative government, facing possible defeat in next year's federal elections, has been trying to woo voters in the face of the growing anti-military mood. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s opposition party, the Social Democrats, turned up the heat on <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> to not back down on the issue. Party chairman <PERSON> Hans-Jochen </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON> demanded that <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> `` abide by the national consensus.'' <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON> said short-range weapons should be ultimately removed from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The debate over short-range nuclear weapons has created divisions within the alliance with a key <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit just a month away. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, who sides with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the disagreement, is scheduled to fly to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> on Sunday and is expected to take up the matter with <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, once one of the most anti-nuclear voices in the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance, also backed the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` The Dutch view does n't match the German view as it has now been publicized'' during <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>'s and <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> visit, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Vliet </PERSON> said Tuesday in The Hague. But <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> has the support of several other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> countries, including <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> also wants <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> to postpone a final decision on the alliance's plans for upgrading short-range nuclear weapons, and has the support of several smaller <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> countries. Both <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> said they were optimistic <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> would be able to forge a common position on the nuclear weapons before its summit in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> at the end of May. Neither official gave any indication of a breakthrough. <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> said that during his visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, it became clear to him that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> `` recognizes our right to have a say in this matter.'' Most of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s short-range nuclear weapons _ 88 <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> launchers with a range of up to about 75 miles _ are based in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Because of their short range, the nuclear-tipped missiles are designed to be used almost exclusively on German soil. <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> also said he believes that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s view on short-range weapons `` will have a significant effect on the formulation of a -LRB- common -RRB- position within the alliance,'' but he did not elaborate. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s government, in a surprise move, announced last week that it favors prompt superpower negotiations on reducing short-range nuclear weapons. Just a week earlier, the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> made a detailed proposal for starting up such talks. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have said they fear the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact may be trying to drive a wedge among <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nations with a flurry of recent disarmament proposals.

 Sales of existing homes dropped 4.3 percent in March, the third straight monthly decline, as rising mortgage interest rates made more inroads into the housing market, a real estate trade group said Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> said sales of existing single-family homes dropped to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.33 million units in March, the slowest pace since February 1988. Sales had dropped 2 percent in February and 9.4 percent in January. The March figures were the latest in a series of reports that indicate rising interest rates are slowing the economy and taking a toll on home sales and residential construction. Last week, the government reported that construction of new homes and apartments declined 5.4 percent in March, the second straight monthly decline. Because housing usually slows down in advance of other sectors of the economy, the weak performance has heightened fears that a recession could come later this year or in early 1990. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> for a year has been pushing up interest rates as part of a campaign to slow the economy and keep inflation in check. `` This is another piece of evidence that things are softening and that high interest rates do make a difference,'' <PERSON> Maury </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said of the latest housing report. Fixed-rate home mortgages averaged between 10.86 percent and 11.22 percent in March, up a full percentage point from a year earlier, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gribin </PERSON>, president of the Realtors, said the higher rates are having their biggest impact on first-time home buyers He said they are `` the first to leave the market and the last who are able to get back in.'' With fewer sales last month to first-time buyers, the median price of existing homes sold rose $ 1,200 to $ 93,100, meaning half the homes sold for more and half for less. `` What we are seeing is definitely a trade-up market,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON>, chief economist for the Realtors. `` People still in the market are those with the incomes to withstand higher monthly mortgage payments resulting from higher interest rates.'' Economist <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramley </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said that while further declines lie ahead for the housing industry, `` this is not a collapse of the housing market.'' `` Monetary policy used to clobber the housing market,'' <PERSON> Gramley </PERSON> said. `` Now it's nibbling gently on the fringes.'' <PERSON> Gramley </PERSON> said slower growth is `` just what the doctor ordered'' to dampen inflationary pressures and keep the economic expansion alive. By region, the sharpest decline in home sales last month was in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, where the resale pace was down 10 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 540,000 units. Sales in the <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> had declined 15.5 percent during February. Sales last month were down 7.6 percent in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> to an annual rate of 850,000 units and fell 3.1 percent in the South to a rate of 1.27 million units. The only increase was recorded in the West, where sales rose 4.7 percent to an annual rate of 670,000 units.

<TEXT>
 The espionage conviction of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, the only <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent ever convicted of spying, was overturned by a federal appeals court today because of the use of lie-detector evidence at his trial. The 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled that the jury should not have been told the results of <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s polygraph examinations, which concluded that he was lying about his motives. The polygraph evidence bolstered the credibility of <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s later admissions of wrongdoing, `` the heart of the prosecution's case,'' the court said in a 3-0 The decision entitles <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> to a new trial on charges that he spied for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> was convicted in June 1986 of passing secrets to the Soviets through his lover, <PERSON> Svetlana </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogorodnikova </PERSON>, in return for promises of $ 65,000 in cash and gold. He was sentenced to two life terms plus 50 years in prison. She and her husband, <PERSON> Nikolay </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogorodnikov </PERSON>, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit espionage and are serving prison terms. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON> was informed of the ruling while attending a speech by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on a ranch in <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. `` Oh really?'' <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON> said. `` We'll obviously want to take a look at the 9th Circuit opinion. We may re-appeal and we have other means. If those fail, we will retry the case. We'll deal with it when we see the decision,'' <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> lawyer who represented <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, reacted by noting the time <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> has spent behind bars since his arrest: `` We're very, very pleased, but we would be more pleased if we did n't have to go through five years waiting for a fair trial with a client in custody.'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a 20-year <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> veteran, was portrayed by prosecutors as a bitter, vengeful failure easily recruited as a spy. The defense described him as a well-meaning <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> misfit who dreamed of redeeming his career by infiltrating the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> spy network in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He was charged with furnishing a clasified document called the <ORGANIZATION> Positive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guide </ORGANIZATION>, which sets forth annual <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence needs, to his lover for delivery to the Soviet consulate in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> in August 1984. In reversing his conviction, the appeals court ruled there were several errors by U.S. District Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON>, who presided over the trial in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. One was <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON>'s decision to admit evidence of lie-detector tests that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> gave <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> during the investigation of the case. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> insisted during the questioning that his actions were intended to benefit the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. But the polygraph examiner told him he had failed the tests. Shortly afterward, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said for the first time that he had given a classified document to Mrs. <PERSON> Ogorodnikova </PERSON>; at trial, he contended his admission was false. Over defense objections, <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> allowed evidence of the results as well as the questions and answers of <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s lie-detector test, saying those tests had set the scene for his disputed admission about the document. The appeals court, in an opinion by Judge <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, noted that lie-detector results are generally prohibited as evidence of the truthfulness of the person being questioned, because of doubts about the reliability of the device. Lie-detector evidence can be admitted for other purposes in limited circumstances, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said. In several cases a jury has been told that a defendant confessed after being told he failed a polygraph. But she said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s jury was told much more damaging information. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> improperly admitted evidence that <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> had once bribed an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> informant. In addition, she said testimony by a man presented by the government as an expert on Soviet intelligence and recruiting tactics was improperly used to attack <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s character. Judges <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Reinhardt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Diarmuid </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Scannlain </PERSON> joined the opinion.

<TEXT>
 Neighbors of the house where <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> hid from the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> are waging a campaign against a projected renovation of the building, now a top tourist attraction. Fearing loss of privacy as well as inconvenience caused by construction work, residents of the central <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> district housing the last home of the world-famous teen-age Nazi victim have written a letter protesting the four-year renovation plan. The Dutch capital's agency for the preservation of monuments is also opposed to the project, with its director saying the plan will `` destroy ... the memories it conveys.'' At issue is an `` urgently necessary project to create sufficient room'' for the <ORGANIZATION> Anne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Frank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s 560,000 annual visitors, said <PERSON> Nico </PERSON> <PERSON> Salm </PERSON>, a spokesman for the foundation that owns the building. Pending City Hall approval, the $ 6 million renovation is to start in January, <PERSON> Salm </PERSON> said in an interview Tuesday. <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> was a Jewish girl whose posthumously published diary on her life-in-hiding in an annex behind the <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> canal house gained her a worldwide audience. In the closing weeks of World War II, she died in the <LOCATION> Bergen-Belsen </LOCATION> concentration camp at the age of 15 after having been caught in 1944. The museum not only tells the story of <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>'s short life _ including a display of the annex in its original state _ but also stages exhibitions on topics related to racism and repression. Opened in 1960 and consisting of two 18-foot-wide canal houses built in the 18th century, the museum `` needs to be rearranged internally to improve access to the annex and the other displays,'' <PERSON> Salm </PERSON> said. `` Right now, throngs of visitors are completely jamming the premises so that the museum is almost collapsing under its own success,'' <PERSON> Salm </PERSON> said. Under the new plan, the space dedicated to the exhibition is to be tripled. `` The renovation project is not aimed at attracting even more visitors, but to create a better atmosphere and more space for the same amount of them,'' said <PERSON> Salm </PERSON>, who noted that on some busy summer days, the museum is closed down for hours at a time to avoid traffic jams inside. In their letter, the neighbors said a planned all-glass extension in the museum's garden, which borders their houses, will lead to an `` unacceptable'' loss of privacy and a decline in the value of their real estate. They said they feared the construction work involved in the project will cause inconvenience `` for years to come.'' A copy of the letter was obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, but none of the signatories was available for comment. <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dekkers </PERSON>, the director of <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monument </ORGANIZATION> preservation, said the 1,116-square-foot garden extension, which is to be used as an exposition and lecture hall, `` is simply too brazen ... it will definitely destroy the authenticity of the complex, of the memories it conveys.'' Mels Crouwel, the architect of the renovations, said that `` all possible care has been taken to avoid vistas by the public into the neighboring gardens.'' The rest of the work will involve extensive renovations, maintenance, and a complete reshuffle of the displays, as well as conservation of the annex, where <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> and her family lived from 1942-44. Tipped off by a Nazi collaborator, the German police raided the annex in August 1944, and <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>, her sister and their parents were among the estimated 100,000 Dutch Jews deported to the extermination camps during the five-year <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> occupation of the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. Only 10 percent of those returned after the war, among them <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Otto </PERSON>, who published his daughter's diary in 1947. Since then, the book has been translated into dozens of languages and millions of copies have been sold.

 Four activists were arrested today after they sealed themselves into an office at the <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters to protest the price of an AIDS drug. `` We've been trying to deal with this company for two years,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Staley </PERSON>, one of the four men led in shackles from the building 45 minutes after the takeover began. The activists were charged with trespassing and damage to property. The pharmaceutical company produces Retrovir, which costs patients or their insurers $ 8,000 to $ 10,000 a year, making it the most expensive drug ever marketed. Formerly known as azidothymidine, or AZT, the drug is the only <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government-approved medicine aimed at halting the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The four protesters, who are scheduled for a May 4 court appearance, are members of the New York-based <ORGANIZATION> AIDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to Unleash Power, said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Blotcher </PERSON>, a spokesman for the group. He said <PERSON> Staley </PERSON>, 28, is a former Wall Street bond trader who has AIDS-related symptoms. <PERSON> Staley </PERSON>, who said the activists were unarmed and non-violent, said they intended to maintain their takeover until their demands were met. `` We want a 25 percent reduction of the price of AZT,'' said <PERSON> Staley </PERSON>. `` We want them to subsidize the government assistance program on AZT.'' <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> said the protest was `` misdirected because we have been trying for three years to get AIDS therapy to people suffering the disease.'' <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION> ACT-UP </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said sheriff's deputies and <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> guards broke down a non-permanent wall to get to the activists, who had chained themselves to a door. He said his group would pay for damages. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> claimed <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> made an 80 percent profit on the drug. Ms. <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> had never released figures on its profit and she did n't know where the 80 percent figure came from. Tests on AZT showed it can stop the AIDS virus from replicating, but does not cure patients. An estimated 8 percent of AIDS patients being tested died while on the drug, compared with 40 percent who died while taking a placebo during a nine-month test period. The drug also increasingly is being prescribed for patients who test positive for the human immunodeficiency virus but have not developed any of the infections or cancers that kill AIDS patients. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> have estimated 1.5 million Americans are infected with the virus.

He said the firm represented `` witnesses or a witness that would appear today or tomorrow.'' Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the committee, said, `` We do n't have cooperative witnesses.'' <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> would not identify the witnesses or the law firm, but <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> financier <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON> and his business associate and son, M.D. -LRB- <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, had been scheduled to be questioned Wednesday. <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said refusal of a witness to appear before the panel is not unique, and said he did not know when the committee would resume taking depositions. Last week, the panel formally charged <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> with 69 violations of House rules in his financial dealings with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> developer, and in sales of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s book, `` Reflections of a Public Man.'' The panel said its inquiry remained open to look into the oil deal, a drilling venture in <LOCATION> Sabine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> near the Texas-Louisiana line. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> defended his book sales, saying `` I never consciously considered that ... buying books as payment for my making a speech.'' The ethics panel has alleged that he used bulk sales of the book to evade limits on outside income from speaking fees. Asked whether he would donate any excess earnings to charity if the committee asked him to do so to correct the situation, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said, `` Of course I'd do it.'' The committee leaders arrived in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> Monday to interview witnesses as to how the Wright-Mallick partnership made a one-day profit of $ 340,880 last May 10 on the oil well investment. The committee is studying `` the amount of profit over a few hours' time,'' <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said. `` It does n't look good.'' The ethics committee said it wanted to determine whether <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> knew about the oil well deal, which involved the <ORGANIZATION> Jaffes </ORGANIZATION>, a West German-owned firm, and the blind trust established for <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> in 1987, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>, the ethics committee's counsel. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> declined to say whether they would seek contempt citations against the reluctant witnesses. Asked if he was upset, <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said, `` Yes, we came down here to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to expedite this, and find they are less than cooperative.'' `` There is a possibility we will'' return to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said. The operator of the southeast <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oil well, L.R. <PERSON> Brammer </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Brammer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, was interviewed Monday. A <LOCATION> Beaumont </LOCATION> oil man told the <ORGANIZATION> Beaumont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> the oil well in question was located in an area of what he termed `` spotty production'' in <LOCATION> Sabine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>. The wildcat venture was in an area that yielded few natural gas wells and mostly dry ones, said <PERSON> Geneos </PERSON> `` Pete'' <PERSON> Cokinos </PERSON>, a petroleum and geological consultant. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has denied any wrongdoing and pledged to fight the allegations. Of the 1988 oil well transaction, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has said his financial holdings were in a blind trust and he was unaware of the deal. The panel is considering whether there is `` clear and convincing'' proof of the 69 alleged violations and, if so, whether to recommend disciplinary action to the House.

 A strong earthquake shook <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and other parts of southern <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> this morning, cracking buildings and sending thousands of panicked people into the streets. At least one death was reported. Ambulances raced around the capital, sirens blaring, after the 8:29 a.m. -LRB- 10:29 a.m. EDT -RRB- tremor. The government news agency <ORGANIZATION> Notimex </ORGANIZATION> reported one man was electrocuted and died and that two women were seriously injured when they jumped from the second story of a swaying building during the tremor. The death and injuries occurred in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the agency said. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Earthquake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, said preliminary readings indicated the quake registered 6.8 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale. The epicenter was 40 miles east of <LOCATION> Acapulco </LOCATION>, about 200 miles south of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, seismologist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Minsch </PERSON> said. The tremor was felt strongly in <LOCATION> Acapulco </LOCATION>, causing brief power failures and panic, said <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerra </PERSON>, advertising director of the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Novedades </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acapulco </ORGANIZATION>. `` I've never felt a tremor so strong in the city and I've lived here for 30 years. I thought the building would collapse,'' he said. <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, spokesman for the <LOCATION> Guerrero </LOCATION> state government, said `` there are no reports of loss of life or major damage throughout the state,'' including heavily populated <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> tourist spots such as Zijuatanejo and <LOCATION> Acapulco </LOCATION>. `` Even though the quake was intensively felt, everything is normal and there are also reports of no major damage. We did a survey by radio,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the earthquake began as a small jolt and stopped momentarily, then buildings in the capital began swaying back and forth, with plaster cracking. The tremor shook <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> at about the same time as the large earthquake that struck in Sept. 19, 1985, killing at least 10,000 people and knocking down hundreds of buildings. That quake measured 8.1 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale. Today's earthquake knocked out power and telephone service in some parts of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and damaged water lines. Schools were evacuated to check for damage. Many buildings in the capital were evacuated. The temblor cut off power to <ORGANIZATION> Televisa </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest television network, for a few minutes. Service in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s subway stopped temporarily to check for damage on the lines. A 19-story building that houses the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s budget office suffered considerable damage as plaster fell, according to evacuees. The building had been rebuilt after the 1985 quake. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON>, who works in the penthouse offices, said, `` It was horrible. There was hysteria. Parts of the ceiling fell, but they were not big enough to hurt anyone. Some of us calmed many people and made them go down the stairway.'' <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> correspondents reported broken windows and panic in neighborhoods around the capital, including <PERSON> Polanco </PERSON>, <PERSON> Condesa </PERSON> and <PERSON> Napoles </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Condesa </LOCATION>, a resident said she heard `` cracking sounds,'' saw `` people running into the streets'' and `` could see the earth moving.'' Radio Red reported that a police helicopter spotted no collapsed buildings. <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Almeida </PERSON> waited in a park outside his office in the <LOCATION> Condesa </LOCATION> neighborhood. `` When there's an earthquake, there can be another one afterwards,'' he said. An office worker who gave her name only as <PERSON> Magdalena </PERSON>, said, `` It sounded like hail was falling. It sounded really ugly, as if the building was breaking.'' <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Esquivel </PERSON>, a carpenter working on fourth floor of modern apartment building that was damaged in 1985 quake, sat in the park, his tools by his side. `` The apartment where I'm working cracked.'' He said there was a small separation where the wall joins the ceiling. The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. Every increase of one number means that the ground motion is 10 times greater. A quake of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage in populated areas. A quake of magnitude 7 is considered a major earthquake, capable of widespread, heavy damage in populated areas. Today's quake was centered about 250 miles southeast of the 1985 earthquake, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Survey </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said. The agency said the earlier earthquake released 90 times more energy than today's quake. An earthquake with a magnitude 5.9 was reported on July 15, 1987, 100 miles east of today's earthquake.

 The government moved Tuesday to halt a 9-day-old student protest for democracy and a free press, urging them to go back to class and disband their fledgling unions, and warning workers to stay on the job. In a harsh editorial, read on the televised nightly news and hourly on the radio, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> called for a swift end to the student movement, the biggest since the revolution of 1949. `` This is a grave political struggle facing the whole party and Chinese citizens,'' the editorial said. `` This is a planned conspiracy that ... aims at negating the leadership of the party and the socialist system.'' It called the student unions illegal and said new demonstrations would be suppressed. The unions were set up this week to replace the state-run student organizations. `` This is their first step,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> student as the editorial was played repeatedly over loudspeakers on campus. `` We can expect arrests to come soon.'' Students and student leaders said they would defy the editorial. `` It makes me sick to hear this,'' said one student at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Normal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` This is just this kind of propaganda and lies we are fighting.' At least 50,000 students have boycotted class since the strike began Monday. They plan to maintain the boycott at least until May 4, the 70th anniversary of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s first pro-democracy student movement. They also said they would persist in calling for talks with the government to discuss demands for a free press, more funds for education and the publication of the financial records of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leaders Many also want senior leaders such as Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> and <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> to resign. About 10,000 soldiers from a special force for suppressing civic disturbances took up positions in many buildings near university campuses, students and <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> sources said. Police and agents from the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> also occupied apartments in the univerity area, the northwest corner of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, sources said. The government took steps to keep workers from supporting the two-day student class boycott, warning them that sympathy strikes would not be tolerated. `` I'm all for what the students are demanding,'' said a worker reading a poster on the street outside <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` I really think the government is no good.'' Another worker, who used his lunch break to hear speeches by university students, said `` many workers are sympathetic to the students, but they do n't dare take part.'' He said his factory and others were given orders to keep the workers in line. Many workers back the student movement because of its criticism of corruption, which runs rampant in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s state-run factories. The students also have won sympathy among many journalists, whose state-controlled publications have been barred from publishing news of the class boycott. Only two newspapers have mentioned the student marches for democracy. Authorities banned this week's edition of the Shanghai-based <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> after it apparently printed material critical of the government. Universities throughout <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> also tried to force the tens of thousands of striking students back to class. Some schools threatened students with expulsions. Others issued warnings of unspecified punishment. The protest is the latest in a series of student actions triggered by the April 15 death of ousted <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> was purged after he was accussed of being too soft on students during pro-democracy protests in 1986-87. On Friday and Saturday, about 150,000 people marched to <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> in one of the biggest protests since the communist victory in 1949. The demonstrations are the clearest rejection yet by Chinese students of the communist system. For the first time Tuesday, bands of students ventured into the city's center to distribute leaflets calling for democracy, freedom and a free press. They positioned themselves outside the railroad station and at two busy intersections with collection boxes and microphones to persuade their countrymen of the righteousness of their cause. `` Comrades, our struggle is just beginning and we must have your support,'' yelled a bespectacled physics student at the Xidan intersection. `` We are fighting for a new <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Down with corruption and dictatorship.''

 Eight <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen were remembered for their sacrifice Tuesday, nine years after they died in a desert in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> while trying to rescue American hostages. On a brilliant, blue morning on a hillside in Arlington National Cemetery, the men who died at Desert One were honored in a ceremony by friends, family and some of those they were trying to save. `` They gave their lives trying to secure my freedom _ that is the ultimate sacrifice,'' said former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Chief Warrant Officer <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, one of the 52 Americans who were taken hostage in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> Nov. 3, 1979, by Iranians and held for 444 days. The rescue mission was attempted by an all-volunteer military team on April 25, 1980. After the mission was abandoned, three Marines and five <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> servicemen died when a helicopter and a transport plane collided in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Great Salt Desert. Six former hostages, including former Ambassador <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Laingen </PERSON>, joined relatives of the dead servicemen for the ceremony sponsored by No Greater Love, a humanitarian organization that aids the families of victims of war and terrorism. They placed a wreath at a marker honoring the eight soldiers, and three yellow roses at the nearby grave of the three who are buried together at <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>. `` This is a wonderful ceremony _ it makes me feel better,'' said <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, aunt of Sgt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Roanoke </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, who at age 21 was the youngest of those killed on the mission. `` I'm very proud of him,'' she said. `` He gave his life for these men and the country. He was dedicated to what he was doing at the Marines. He believed in them.'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehouse </PERSON>, assistant secretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> for special operations and low-intensity conflict, said the deaths reminded the nation that `` the courage to try must be matched by the capability to succeed.'' `` Here we were found wanting,'' he said, adding that the military since then has improved special forces preparedness.

 About 20,000 people lined up Tuesday to visit the ancient pyramid of <PERSON> Gaius </PERSON> <PERSON> Cestius </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, which was opened to the public for the first time in three centuries. Many people stood on line for three hours to get a glimpse of the interior of the 88-foot-tall tomb of Roman official <PERSON> Gaius </PERSON> <PERSON> Cestius </PERSON>, built in 12 B.C. as part of the wall surrounding <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s Culture Ministry opened the monument for only one day to mark the holiday commemorating the country's liberation by the Allies in World War II. In the past, the pyramid has been open by special appointment only. <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Venditelli </PERSON>, an archaeological expert who supervises the monument, said it was unlikely the pyramid would be opened again any time soon. `` It is not repeatable because of problems with conserving the monument, which today is subjected to a great amount of stress,'' she said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it is beginning a pilot project aimed at providing up to $ 100 million for creative home mortgages for the elderly. The program is aimed at making housing more available and affordable for the elderly with mortgages that reduce housing costs or allow senior citizens to supplement their income by taking advantage of the equity in their current homes. Vice President <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riordan </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Fannie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mae </ORGANIZATION> would encourage lenders to offer these mortgages to the elderly and commit to buying up to $ 100 million in the mortgages on the secondary market. <ORGANIZATION> Fannie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mae </ORGANIZATION>, which is congressionally chartered, is the nation's largest investor in home mortgages The program will provide mortgages for: accessory apartments within a single-family home, which an elderly person could then rent for extra income; temporary housing units built on a family member's property; homes shared by a senior citizen and one or more other adults; and the sale of a home by an elderly person to a family member or investor who then rents it back to the seller. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Fannie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mae </ORGANIZATION> chairman, said it will alter underwriting standards as part of the project, permitting lower down payments on certain types of mortgages and including net rental income as part of a borrower's qualifying income. <PERSON> Riordan </PERSON> said the loans are offered now on a sporadic basis if at all, and that <ORGANIZATION> Fannie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mae </ORGANIZATION> hopes to encourage the availablility of the loans and determine which are most successful.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, in a ruling welcomed in Western states, said Tuesday states may tax businesses for oil and gas extracted from Indian reservations. In a 6-3 decision in a case from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the justices said such taxes neither illegally infringe on the rights of Indians nor do they amount to illegal multiple taxation. The court upheld <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s authority to tax oil and gas taken from the Jicarilla Apache reservation there. The levies were challenged by <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which also pays taxes to the tribe for the extracted minerals. `` Today's ruling is a substantial and rather profound victory for the state of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>,'' said Gov. <PERSON> Garrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Carruthers </PERSON>. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> collects about $ 19 million a year in such so-called severance taxes from oil and gas and coal production on Indian land in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The court ruling also is good news for officials in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. There are some 150 cases in the four states in which businesses with Indian mining leases say they are victims of illegal multiple taxation _ by a state and a tribe. Justice <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, writing for the court, rejected arguments that the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> tax interferes with tribal economic development by prompting producers to look off Indian reservations for mineral deposits. He said a 1938 federal law, the Indian Mineral Leasing Act, does not specifically pre-empt the power of states to tax oil and gas on Indian lands. `` Any impairment to the federal policy favoring the exploitation of on-reservation oil and gas resources by <PERSON> Indian </PERSON> tribes ... is simply too indirect and too insubstantial to support'' a claim the state tax is pre-empted, <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said. He also said that <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION>, which has a lease with the Apaches for oil and gas on the reservation, is not subject to unfair double taxation. `` It is, of course, true that the total taxes paid by Cotton are higher than those paid by off-reservation producers,'' he said. `` But neither the state nor the tribe imposes a discriminatory tax. The burdensome consequence is entirely attributable to the fact that the leases are located in an area where two governmental entities share jurisdiction.'' The high court in 1982 ruled that the Jicarilla Apaches may impose their own severance tax on oil and gas extracted from their reservation. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> noted Tuesday that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> provides services to Cotton Petroleum on the reservation. There is no constitutional requirement that the services the company receives be equal in value to the amount of taxes it pays, <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> added. The Constitution does not demand that `` benefits received from a tax authority by an ordinary commercial taxpayer ... must equal the amount of its tax obligations,'' he said. Finally, <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said, the Apache tribe is not a `` state,'' and therefore <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> is not subject to multiple state taxation. In a dissenting opinion, Justice <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> said <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is increasing its revenue `` at the expense of tribal economic development.'' That violates federal policy, expressed in laws and regulations, to protect Indian self-determination, he said. He was joined by Justices <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>. Cotton Petroleum challenged taxes on oil and gas taken from some 15,000 acres of land on the Jicarilla Apache reservation. The company pays taxes to the tribe amounting to about 6 percent of its production, and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> levies taxes on the company amounting to 8 percent of its production. Cotton Petroleum noted that oil and gas producers in the state with deposits taken from non-Indian land only pay 8 percent in taxes. The company said it paid $ 2.3 million in taxes to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> from 1981 through 1985 but received only $ 89,000 in services from the state. The Jicarilla tribe was not a direct participant in the case. It filed a friend-of-the-court brief expressing its opposition to the state taxes. In other decisions, the court: _ Upheld a 1986 federal law imposing `` safety user fees'' on pipeline companies that transport natural gas and hazardous liquids In a case from <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, the court said the law does not give the executive branch too much of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' power to impose taxes. _ Tossed out a dispute from <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> over the federal government's power to ban newspapers from publishing lists of winners in privately run lotteries The court said the case is moot because the government no longer intends to enforce the ban.

 Buffalo are more at home on the range, a doctor has decided after five years of dealing with problems caused by the freedom-loving American bison.

<TEXT>
 At a tavern in <LOCATION> Coburg </LOCATION>, there's `` pickled spotted owl egg'' and `` fried or broasted spotted owl'' on the menu. An Oakridge tavern held a spotted owl dinner two weeks ago, and attracted a big crowd. A <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> man plans to market `` spotted owl jerky.'' The food is n't really owl meat, but the spoofs are signs of how high emotions are running in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>'s timber country over the northern spotted owl and its habitat in old-growth forest coveted by loggers. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Allison </PERSON>, publisher of High Lead magazine in <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON>, said he's sold more than 600 T-shirts that feature a hairy logger carrying an owl on a tray with the caption `` save a logger, eat an owl.'' Despite the protestations, the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said today in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, it will tell a federal court in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> next week that protection of the spotted owl as a threatened species is warranted. Listing a species as `` threatened'' is slightly less restrictive than listing a species as `` endangered,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, associate chief of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. However, it still could lock loggers out of much of the old-growth forest west of the <ORGANIZATION> Cascade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Range </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> earlier decided against listing the owl as endangered, but a reassessment was ordered by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Zilly </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Zilly </PERSON> found the earlier decision was not supported by evidence compiled by Fish and Wildlife. Under the Endangered Species Act, a species is considered endangered if it is `` in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant part of its range.'' A species is considered threatened if it is `` likely to become an endangered species in the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range.'' <PERSON> Rolla </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, who works at the <ORGANIZATION> Bohemia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> plywood plant in <LOCATION> Vaughn </LOCATION>, has written a poem about the owl. In it, he tells of a man seeing a spotted owl contentedly sitting on a limb in a stand of old-growth trees. `` Even tho I soon may lose my job And stand to lose my home I ca n't explain the peace I felt Like none I've never known. Standing there in that quiet place Far from the sound of cars I looked around, took careful aim Then blew his brains to Mars.'' Environmentalists who say the owl is faced with extinction because of logging, and timber industry representatives who say the trees are needed to keep the industry alive in the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, agree that the spotted owl dinners, T-shirts and poems are signs of frustration and fear. <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> of the environmental group <ORGANIZATION> Earth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> said anti-owl sentiment has been caused by the timber industry. `` They find it convenient to turn their workers' heads around and say, ` Look, it's that owl that's taking your job,' when they're sending logs overseas,'' she said `` It's just a fear thing and I hope workers can look beyond the fear to see what's happenning.'' <PERSON> Allison </PERSON> said he's received only one complaint about his T-shirts. That came from a timber industry official who said the shirts are inappropriate and thought it would be better to show an owl or other wildlife living in harmony with good forest practices. <PERSON> Allison </PERSON> accuses both sides of `` tunnel vision.'' `` The spotted owl is a means to an end,'' he said. `` If it was n't that, it would be the pig-tailed titmouse. The -LRB- environmentalists' -RRB- goal is to save old growth.'' As for the timber industry, he said, `` How can people like <ORGANIZATION> Weyerhaeuser </ORGANIZATION> send -LRB- logs -RRB- to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, then go bid on federal timber? That's not fair.'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said he really does n't advocate shooting spotted owls, but he lost his job in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> when <LOCATION> Redwood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> was established. `` I just kind of got a new start and I'd hate to see it go down the tubes here,'' he said. `` I'm not so dumb that I think the owl is the only problem,'' he said. `` They're shipping logs -LRB- overseas -RRB-, I realize that. There might be a poem coming on that one of these days.'' `` The owl gets focused on,'' he said, `` because it's kind of a symbol.''

 A federal judge has ordered the city to build a $ 32 million high school to attract white suburban students into a mostly black area as part of a desegregation plan. `` It will be the most phenomenal high school facility in the nation,'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, attorney for the plaintiffs in the school desegregation case.

<HEAD>Employment Costs Fuel Inflationary Pressures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Wages and salaries paid American workers in private industry rose 4.2 percent in the last 12 months, the biggest jump in 3 -LCB- years, the government said Tuesday in a report that showed increasing inflationary pressures from tight labor markets. But the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Employment Cost Index and other economic reports issued Tuesday brought mixed predictions of whether a recession is inevitable or could be averted by slower growth in the record seventh year of the economy's expansion. Economist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, noting a number of recent reports that point to a slowdown in economic expansion, said he believed growth had eased enough to convince the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> that further credit tightening would not be needed to fight inflation. <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> said credit-tightening already done by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> may be enough to postpone a recession for up to two years. `` It's sort of like death: You ca n't cure it, you can only postpone it,'' <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think we've solved the problems of the business cycle.'' But chief economist <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said he was looking for the next downturn to begin within a year as inflationary pressures mount `` What is happening is that wages and salaries are picking up because of the tight labor market. I think there is an increasingly embedded upward tilt in wage compensation and overall employment costs,'' <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON> said. `` There is a recession in there somewhere.'' Others, however, predicted that inflation would ease as the economy slows to a sustainable pace and that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> then would ease its tight hold on credit to help the economy into a `` soft landing.'' `` I do n't think we're headed to a recession,'' said <PERSON> Paine </PERSON> <PERSON> Webber </PERSON> economist <PERSON> Maury </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s going to be able to head this thing off at the pass before it gets out of hand.'' In other economic news Tuesday: _ The government reported that orders to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories for `` big ticket'' durable goods rose a moderate 0.8 percent in March after two months of big declines, reflecting a rebound in orders for transportation equipment Excluding that volatile category, orders were down for the third straight month, declining 2.8 percent. `` The evidence is mounting that the economy has slowed down,'' Data Resources economist <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinner </PERSON> said of that report. _ The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> said sales of existing homes dropped for the third straight month in March to the slowest pace in more than a year That news came a week after the government reported the second straight monthly decline of new-home construction. Both declines are blamed on rising mortgage rates. `` First-time buyers are simply locked out of the market by unaffordable financing,'' said <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gribin </PERSON>, president of the Realtors. _ The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that major collective bargaining settlements reached in private industry in the first quarter provided for average wage increases of 3.1 percent over the life of the contracts That figure was up from average annual wage gains of 2.2 percent in contracts settled in the preceding quarter. Taken together, analysts said that the four reports contained few surprises but confirmed that inflation continues to grow as the economy slows. `` If labor costs are rising, and this data shows that they are, price inflation can hardly be less than that, it has to be more,'' said <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>. Said <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>: `` I think all the reports are basically good news for the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>,'' which has been trying to slow growth to ease inflation. He said the wage gains were higher than the central bank would prefer but added, `` It's hard to panic about it.'' The 4.2 percent increase in private-sector wages and salaries in the year ending March 31 was the highest 12-month jump since a 4.8 percent advance reported for the year ending Sept. 30, 1985. It followed an equally disturbing 4.1 percent rise in wages for the 12 months ending in December. By comparison, wages had risen 3.3 percent for the year ending in March 1988. Overall private-industry employment costs, which include benefits paid by employers in addition to wages and salaries, rose 4.6 percent over the last 12 months, compared to 3.9 percent in the preceding year. `` There is unequivocal evidence of a gradual upward movement in labor costs,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jasinowski </PERSON>, executive vice president and chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION>. The Employment Cost Index is closely watched because it gives a broad view of possible inflationary pressures on business costs. For the first quarter, overall compensation costs in private industry rose 1.3 percent, up from 1.0 percent in the final quarter of 1988 but down from the 1.5 percent increase in the first quarter a year ago, when a 5 percent rise in Social Security taxes boosted benefit costs. Workers in the fast-growing service-producing industries received average wage and salary increases of 5.1 percent over the last 12 months, compared to average 3.1 percent pay gains by workers in goods-producing jobs, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. The rate of wage gains for non-union workers continued to outpace pay increases for union workers, although wages for union workers remain higher.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> accused the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on Tuesday of trying to undermine <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s nuclear defense and instructed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassadors in Western capitals to counter a West German drive for negotiations to scale back short-range nuclear missiles. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> offensive is designed to rally the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> against any reduction in nuclear battlefield weapons before President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> meets with the 15 allied leaders in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> at the end of May. West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, trying to counter growing support for disarmament in his country, sent Defense Minister <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for talks Monday to try to persuade the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration tn negotiate with the Soviets over the missiles. But Secretary of Defense <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> turned the West Germans down, saying it would be a mistake to risk cutbacks in the short-range nuclear missiles and artillery guns that fire nuclear-tipped shells while the Soviets held an advantage in non-nuclear forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> described such negotiations as a `` dangerous trap.'' But <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, whose political future could hinge on the missile issue, is not backing off and will present his position formally to the West German parliament on Thursday. In the meantime, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sent cables to the American ambassadors in all the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> capitals instructing them to present the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> argument against negotiations to the foreign ministries there, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said. The presentations, known technically as `` demarches,'' are designed to forestall a drift toward the West German position, which already enjoys some support in <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said West German ambassadors were expected to mount a campaign for support in all <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> capitals as well. Also, <PERSON> Rozanne </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridgway </PERSON>, the assistant secretary of state for <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> affairs, will present the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position to senior officials of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> on May 16. That is two weeks before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> countries hold a summit meeting in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said `` it would be helpful'' if the missile dispute could be resolved before the meeting. `` There is more to discuss at the summit than SNF -LRB- short-range nuclear forces -RRB-,'' she said. But Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON>, who consulted with <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, said `` the discussions will continue'' and launched into an attack on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` The Soviets clearly want to denuclearize and undermine <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s flexible response and forward-defense strategies,'' she said `` Negotiations would provide them an opportunity to promote a third zero.'' The battlefield nuclear missiles are considered part of a flexible strategy designed to keep the Soviets off-balance. The theory is that uncertainty whether <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> would use nuclear weapons deters a Soviet attack. The 1987 U.S.-Soviet treaty banning intermediate-range nuclear missiles eliminated two categories of nuclear rockets in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. This is known as the ` ` double-zero. The statement read by Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> at <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s direction refers to a third category of missiles _ those with a range below 315 miles _ and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> determination to keep them in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` The Soviets have already modernized their nuclear weapons, and the alliance must also maintain up-to-date forces,'' she said.

 Palestinian attackers on Tuesday stabbed to death two men accused of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. The deaths in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> follow a call by Palestinian uprising leaders for attacks on Arabs cooperating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and an order by Moslem fundamentalists to target drug dealers and prostitutes. Authorities confirmed one of the deaths. A Palestinian also was reported shot and killed Tuesday in a clash with soldiers in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, and 17 others were wounded by army gunfire in the occupied territories, including a 13-year-old girl who was shot in the head. Army officials said they were unaware of the death and were checking reports of clashes. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> declared that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would never surrender part of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> in a peace settlement with Palestinians. The government said Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> would visit the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in May for talks on <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s plan to hold elections in the occupied territories to advance the stalled peace process. Police said they had arrested three suspects in Tuesday's fatal stabbing of <PERSON> Fauzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhareb </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> town of <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Muhareb </PERSON>, 51, left his house accompanied by his wife, said police spokesman <PERSON> Yigal </PERSON> <PERSON> Golan </PERSON>. `` There was a roadblock of burning tires. Three to four young men ... attacked him with knives. They stabbed him in the shoulder and heart.'' Police said <PERSON> Muhareb </PERSON> had a criminal background but would not give details. Palestinian reporters, who insisted on anonymity, said <PERSON> Muhareb </PERSON> was a collaborator with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and a drug dealer. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Azam </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Qadi </PERSON> was beaten and stabbed to death early Tuesday, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reporters said. <PERSON> Al-Qadi </PERSON>, 21, was accused by local Palestinians of giving information to the Shin Bet security service, the <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> said. The PLO-backed leadership of the 16-month Palestinian uprising has repeatedly called for attacks on collaborabors. In its latest leaflet, it declared Wednesday `` a day of accounting for the collaborators.'' In February, a leaflet from the fundamentalist Moslem movement <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION>, or `` Zeal,'' urged Palestinians to `` deal with'' prostitutes and drug dealers. Within the past week, five alleged collaborators were reported killed in the occupied territories, but at least two victims were also said to have criminal connections. Including Tuesday's deaths, 447 Palestinians and 18 Israelis have been killed in the uprising. The latest victim was <PERSON> Khalid </PERSON> <PERSON> Musa </PERSON> <PERSON> Armelat </PERSON>, 22, who was shot in the head during a clash with soldiers in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Rafah </LOCATION>, according to officials at nearby <LOCATION> Nasser </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Tuesday disputed a suggestion by Prime Minister <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> that his country may pull out of a security alliance with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because of his nation's anti-nuclear policies. `` That is <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>'s prerogative,'' said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON>. But, she added, `` we take exception to the prime minister's assertions that such action is justified by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' refusal to consult with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>'' in accordance with terms of the ANZUS pact. <LOCATION> ANZUS </LOCATION>, created in 1951 as a defense alliance among the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, has been crippled since the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> suspended guarantees for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>'s defense in 1986 over the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> nation's ban of ships carrying nuclear weapons. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy is neither to confirm nor deny the existence of nuclear weapons on its vessels. Even if <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> does pull out, `` <ORGANIZATION> ANZUS </ORGANIZATION> would continue to exist as the foundation of our important and active security relationship with <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> statement. `` We continue to hope that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> will reassess its anti-nuclear policies, which would enable it to return to full participation'' in <LOCATION> ANZUS </LOCATION>, the statement said. The rift between the two countries led the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to stop sharing intelligence information with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> and to cool its diplomatic relations with the embassy here. Speaking at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> Monday, <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> said his country's security relationship with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is a `` dead letter. But the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> disputed that view, saying that `` the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> continues to maintain a security relationship with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, albeit much diminished from the close military and intelligence ties existing prior to the current dispute.'' Observers here have noted that despite <PERSON> Lange </PERSON>'s outspoken comments at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> and in several interviews he has granted since arriving for a six-day visit, he has also emphasized that overall relations between the two countries are good. <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> has stressed that trade and tourism have grown. Responding to that tone, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said `` the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> now enjoy a constructive relationship on a range of issues in which we share common goals and objectives. `` We regret, however, that the prime minister's remarks did not more constructively address our difference of opinion on issues raised by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>'s anti-nuclear policies,'' it said. <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> said Monday he would not come to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> because the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration had made it clear he was not welcome until his government renounced its anti-nuclear policies.

<HEAD>Four Months After Rationing Ends, Shortages Start</HEAD>
<UNK>By DRUSILLA MENAKER ^Associated Press Writer</UNK>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government said Tuesday that a severe gas shortage has closed some stations and caused long lines at the pumps, forcing <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> to look to the West for extra gas supplies. The government blamed a 20 percent jump in gasoline consumption on the end of gas rationing Jan. 1, a mild winter that allowed more cars on the road and the government's refusal to allow prices to rise high enough to discourage demand. `` If we were persistent in introducing the market economy, prices would surely regulate the problem of lines,'' said deputy government spokesman <PERSON> Zbyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Rykowski </PERSON>. Concern about gas shortages and price increases began spreading across <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> by word of mouth last week. Confirmation came Tuesday in official newspaper reports the government would tap hard currency supplies to buy about 163 million gallons of gasoline from <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Gas imports planned for the first half of this year from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s largest supplier, arrived early and were used up ahead of schedule, the <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wieczorny </ORGANIZATION> newspaper reported Tuesday. It will be several weeks before the new gas reaches <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and eases the supply problems, said <PERSON> Krzysztof </PERSON> <PERSON> Pilich </PERSON>, deputy manager of the state oil department. But <PERSON> Pilich </PERSON> said rationing would not be introduced again. When rationing ended, the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> warned that prices would increase if sales of gasoline outstripped supplies. The price at the time was 190 zlotys a liter, or $ 1.46 per gallon. The price has been raised to 250 zlotys a liter. The average monthly salary is about $ 127 to $ 175. Disgruntled drivers waiting Tuesday at a <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> gas station had differing opinions about the cause of the shortage, which is being widely discussed in the informal network that keeps residents up to date on supplies of goods. `` I think it is a matter of bad distribution,'' said one man. Another who had waited for four hours without success the night before said he thought the government had created the shortage to keep people from `` moving around the country'' during upcoming elections, the first since 1947. `` I think it is done on purpose and a lot of people share this view,'' he said. <PERSON> Rykowski </PERSON> said there could be some distribution problems but poor planning did not cause the shortage. Instead, he said it stemmed from a failure `` for justifiable, social reasons'' to use higher prices to suppress demand in the style of a market-based economy. `` I am saying this with certain terror because I know that these sorts of moralizing speeches are met with rejection,'' he said at the news conference. `` I do n't intend to continue this sermonizing and point out that in countries with a market-oriented economy, when someone drives to work he calculates how much that costs,'' he said.

 Activists said they canceled a pro-independence rally Tuesday after authorities told them it could spark a repeat of the bloody confrontation with soldiers in which 20 people died. `` There is a danger the tanks will charge again, and the soldiers will shoot. So we postponed the meeting,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Nadiradze </PERSON>, a lawyer who advocates the secession of the republic of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nadiradze </PERSON> said independence activists received the warning from sympathetic police officers, and political leaders advised that the curfew and state of emergency that brought Soviet soldiers into the city could be reinstated. About 5,000 people appeared at the flower-covered square in front of Government House on Tuesday. Young people holding flowers, candles or black flags of mourning guarded a shrine at the crash to the victims of the April 9 clash. But no one stood up to address the group. <PERSON> Irakli </PERSON> <PERSON> Shengalaya </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, an informal political group, said he and other activists decided to postpone the demonstration after Georgian Interior Minister <PERSON> Shota </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorgodze </PERSON> warned earlier Tuesday that the curfew and state of emergency that brought Soviet soldiers and tanks into the republic's capital on April 7 could be reinstated. The soldiers and armor were withdrawn from the city last week, but activist <PERSON> Tengiz </PERSON> <PERSON> Ordzhonikidze </PERSON> said they have been seen in recent days at nearby lakes and in suburbs. Shengelaya and other activists said the interior minister's statement, which was carried on local TV, appeared to be friendly advice rather than a threat <ORGANIZATION> Georgian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Givi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gumbaridze </PERSON>, when asked Monday how he would react to future demonstrations, said: `` What happened on April 9 ca n't happen again.'' Gumbaridze on Monday confirmed accusations by activists that some of the 20 deaths were caused by poison gas used by the soldiers. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Tuesday condemned `` the use of any chemical agents that cause serious injury or death when used against peaceful protesters.'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> urged the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> government to `` investigate fully and openly what happened on April 9.'' In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Georgy </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Razumovsky </PERSON>, a candidate member of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Politburo who visited <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> after the violence, said the decision to break up the protest with force was made `` by local authorities.'' <PERSON> Razumovsky </PERSON>, at a news conference, criticized <LOCATION> Georgian </LOCATION> officials for a `` constant lack of dialogue'' with young people and the intelligentsia on the republic's problems. Activists said the demonstration, which had been planned for the yard of the <ORGANIZATION> Kashveti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, a 13th-century stone building across the street from <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, was postponed to May 21. <LOCATION> Tiblisi </LOCATION> Police Chief <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Zvensadze </PERSON> said he had personally suggested to activists that `` holding a demonstration during the traditional 40 days of mourning would be unseemly.'' The demonstration had been called to demand the release of seven activists arrested hours after the April 9 clash and to `` demand punishment of the murderers,'' said <PERSON> Nadiradze </PERSON>. They also sought were seeking annulment of a <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> decree making it illegal to `` insult or discredit'' the government. Demonstrations in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> first began April 4 when protesters criticized calls from members of the republic's ethnic Abkhazian minority to break away because of alleged discrimination by Georgians. Other protesters have demanded <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> secede from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> because of alleged interference from the central government. The republic's senior party official, <PERSON> Dzhumber </PERSON> <PERSON> Patiashvili </PERSON>, took responsibility for the April 9 attack and resigned.

<HEAD>Publishing and Library Groups Attack Age-Documentation Law</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A new law requiring publishers and distributors to document the ages of nude models in photographs `` will have a truly devastating effect'' on free expression and will not stem the flow of child pornography, a judge was told Tuesday. The law poses near-impossible record-keeping burdens on legitimate businesses and would impose a `` corporate death penalty'' on distributors because all assets could be seized if they violate the law with even one publication, said an attorney for a coalition of publishing and library groups. The coalition claims the law would force librarians to remove from their shelves any medical, sex education and sociological texts showing full frontal nudity and stop magazines and TV shows from using adult sexual material that is protected by the First Amendment. `` It will have a truly devastating effect on entirely lawful, protected speech of adults,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Ennis </PERSON>, an attorney representing the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in a lawsuit against the statute. The law requires that anyone who produces material with images of sexual activity or `` lascivious exhibition of the genitals'' keep records showing the models depicted are at least 18 years old. The law covers the reissue of any materials produced after Feb. 5, 1978 _ the date when a major federal child pornography law took effect. <PERSON> Ennis </PERSON> said the word lascivious is too imprecise, the text of the statute is too broad and the child porno industry is entirely underground and would not be affected by the law. `` The government is concerned about an underground problem, but they impose a solution on a legitimate above-ground industry,'' <PERSON> Ennis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stearns </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> attorney, told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Revercomb </PERSON> that publishers' First Amendment arguments were `` overwrought'' and that they would be little affected by the law. He said if mainstream companies were n't distributing child pornography it must mean they already have adopted ways to prevent such occurrences. <PERSON> Stearns </PERSON> said the government has the right to try to stop the production of `` vast'' amounts of child pornography in this country and the importation of child pornography. The new law would punish criminals, not suppress free expression, he told the judge. Then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed the Child Protection and Obscenity Enforcement Act last November, and the record-keeping requirements were scheduled to start May 17, not Aug. 17 as published incorrectly in the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Register </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Stearns </PERSON> said. The act increases penalties for anyone facilitating use of a child for producing sexually explicit materials, creates a new federal offense for engaging in the business of distributing obscene materials and provides mandatory forfeiture of the profits of those convicted of being engaged in the adult obscenity business. House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, has said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> intended to target only major dealers or producers of obscene materials who were `` knowingly engaged for a long period of time.'' He said the measure was not aimed at the bookstore owner who may have a single volume judged to be obscene. <PERSON> Stearns </PERSON> said the problem in prosecuting child pornography was the difficulty in determining the ages of models. He agreed with <PERSON> Revercomb </PERSON> that the issue involved those aged 14 to 17 who can pass for 19 and 20, such as actress Tracy Lords who made 75 porno films starting when she was 14. <PERSON> Stearns </PERSON> said the law clearly defines illegal sexual acts and `` does n't apply to all frank depictions of the human form.'' Medical texts, art books and news photos would not be in jeopardy, he said. <PERSON> Revercomb </PERSON> took under advisement the coalition's request for a preliminary injunction against the record-keeping and forfeiture provisions. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sought dismissal of the suit. The challengers include the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Booksellers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Read </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Photographers </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Periodical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Distributors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Periodical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Distributors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Satellite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishers </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Software </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> also filed court papers arguing against the law.

 A multimillion-dollar opera-ballet starring 8,000 dancers and musicians, 100 sheep, two elephants and a locomotive will highlight July 14 celebrations of the 200th anniversary of the storming of the Bastille prison. The parade, titled `` La Marseillaise,'' is sure to be `` powerful and joyful,'' Culture Minister <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Lang </PERSON> said Tuesday as he presented the project to reporters. It is a two-hour spectacle that will begin under the recently restored Arc de Triomphe and go the length of the Champs Elysees to end dramatically at the Place de la Concorde. American diva <PERSON> Jessye </PERSON> <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> will sing the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> national anthem _ also titled `` La Marseillaise'' _ behind a backdrop of water. `` Then the sheet of water will open like the <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, and gather up all the performers,'' said <PERSON> Jean-Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gouze </PERSON>, who created the show. The <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Marching Band from <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION> will march backward, dancing the `` moonwalk'' choreographed by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and playing the tunes that made soul king <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> famous. Tanks with lights, sound and confetti will trail the band. About 1,500 drummers representing French regional cultures and traditions will be dressed in sailor suits topped with flaming hats shaped like birthday cakes, while musicians from <LOCATION> Nevers </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> keep tune with the sound of a chugging steam engine. Two hundred British bagpipers and drummers will think they never left home as special effects recreate the thick <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> fog. Among others, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will be presented by dancers and martial artists, African countries are providing zebras that will prance behind women dancers, and Soviet acrobats will perform stunts under a mock snowstorm and a giant skating rink evoking the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution. The musical score has been composed by <PERSON> Wally </PERSON> <PERSON> Badarou </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Benin </LOCATION>. Each egment has been conceived like `` a scene in a movie with its own lighting and special effects,'' said <PERSON> Goude </PERSON>, who was rock star <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' manager.

 Four environmental groups urged the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration Tuesday to phase out all ozone-destroying chemicals by 1995, and said the government is courting disaster by proposing to allow some production until the year 2000. `` None of the potential scenarios for protecting the ozone layer which have been considered thus far'' by the government `` are designed to do more than stabilize atmospheric chlorine concentrations at 1985 levels,'' the groups said in a report. The 1985 levels, the report said, were more than enough to poke a hole in the ozone layer over the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION>, which appeared in the late 1970s. It is the chlorine in chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons that breaks down in the stratosphere, and destroys the earth's ozone shield. Depletion of the ozone layer lets ultra-violet radiation from te sun get through, increasing the risk of skin cancer and eye disease, while threatening plant life on land and in water. The report was prepared by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> group; the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toxics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION>, and the Clean Water Action Project. The groups said they would knock on doors in 40 states and mobilize local activist organizations to win support for an earlier phaseout than currently planned. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government is part of the Montreal Protocol, the 1987 treaty that requires industrial nations to cut production of <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION>'s to 50 percent of 1986 levels by 1999 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> have proposed going further, calling for a ban on <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> production by the year 2000. The report called for a 50 percent cutback of <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION>'s and related chemicals by 1991, and elimination of these chemicals _ plus another ozone-depleter, carbon tetrachloride _ by 1995. The groups also proposed 1995 elimination of methyl chloroform, which has similar destructive effects, with a five-year extension if no safe alternative is available. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chemical companies are now testing <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> substitutes, but production is not expected for three-to-five years, according to the industry. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegates to an international meeting of <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> Protocol signers next week are expected to warn that unrestricted use of now-unregulated carbon tetrachloride and methyl chloroform could offset the phaseout of <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION>'s in the treaty. Last week, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> published a notice in the Federal Register that the upcoming meeting, in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>, is likely to propose that the two chemicals be included in the protocol. The new environmental report said, `` The <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> Protocol agreement would allow stratospheric chlorine levels from human emissions in the next 50 years to increase to a level four times higher than the level ... that existed'' before the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> ozone hole was discovered. `` Even under <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s strongest set of measures, by -LRB- the year -RRB- 2100 stratospheric chlorine levels from human emissions are projected to remain higher'' than the level that caused the ozone hole, the report added. `` In the long term, to allow atmospheric chlorine levels anywhere near those which catalyzed the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> hole is to court disaster,'' the report said. CFC gases are used as computer solvents, refrigerants and foam-blowing agents for insulation. Halons are used in fire-fighting equipment. Carbon tetrachloride and methyl chloroform are solvents used to clean machinery.

 Helmeted police detained at least three people Tuesday at a noisy rally where an anti-communist independence group announced candidates for upcoming elections to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. The Confederation for an Independent <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> said it will field three candidates in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> for the larger <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION> chamber in an effort to weaken the communist system. Police vehicles lined the street in front of the gates to <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, where the rally began. Then police wielding batons and metal shields moved in and detained at least three people, including two confederation members, when about 50 supporters ran into a police line. Confederation campus leader <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Gawkowski </PERSON> announced that he, <PERSON> Stanislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazurkiewicz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stanislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Dronicz </PERSON> will run for the <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION>. Anybody who gathers 3,000 signatures can run for one of the 161 seats available to independent candidates in the 460-member Sejm, or a seat in the new 100-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> that will be the first freely elected legislative body in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc. <PERSON> Gawkowski </PERSON> said that if police do not stop interfering with election efforts of the confederation, known by its Polish initials <ORGANIZATION> KPN </ORGANIZATION>, the group will call for a boycott of the June voting. `` <ORGANIZATION> KPN </ORGANIZATION> will not stop organizing protests. We want to beat the communist system down to its foundations,'' he told listeners. Authorities consider the confederation an illegal organization and police regularly break up its rallies and meetings. Deputy government spokesman <PERSON> Zbyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Rykowski </PERSON> told reporters Tuesday that confederation rallies are `` aggressive and rough,'' and `` contradictory with the spirit of conciliation.'' Meanwhile, 1,500 supporters of the students' union <ORGANIZATION> NZS </ORGANIZATION> marched across <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> to the Education Ministry to demand legal registration of the independent group and improved conditions at campuses. A hearing is scheduled for Wednesday on legalizing the union.

<TEXT>
 Gangs of angry Mauritanians armed with sticks and clubs harassed Senegalese citizens and sacked their shops Tuesday, forcing the government to impose a dusk-to-dawn curfew. In the Senegalese capital of <LOCATION> Dakar </LOCATION>, 375 miles to the south, anti-Mauritanian violence was not quelled until 4 a.m. Tuesday after the army was called out and police resorted to tear gas. Both countries reinforced their troops along the <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> border, as tensions mounted over a land dispute. Government officials in the two <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> nations tried to calm passions sparked by the April 9 killing of two Senegalese farmers, allegedly shot by <LOCATION> Mauritanian </LOCATION> soldiers in <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Diawara </PERSON> border village Two people have died in violence in <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION> since then. Sporadic outbursts against Mauritanian shopkeepers in <LOCATION> Dakar </LOCATION> and Senegalese in <LOCATION> Nouakchott </LOCATION> grew into widespread violence Sunday. `` Our compatriots must imperatively, no matter what pain they have suffered, chase from their hearts the cowardly sentiment of vengeance,'' Interior Minister <PERSON> Gibril </PERSON> <PERSON> Ould </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdallahy </PERSON> said in a statement broadcast Tuesday on Mauritanian radio and television. He announced an 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew in <LOCATION> Nouakchott </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nouadihbou </LOCATION>, the principal port. A government source denied reports three people died in <LOCATION> Nouakchott </LOCATION> violence, although he added officials do not have complete casualty lists. Truckloads of police, some with riot helmets and shields, rushed through the streets of this sand-blown capital of 500,000 people. Violence has been concentrated in poor quarters and shantytowns. Angry crowds formed in dirt back streets, occasionally surging onto a main artery to attack Senegalese and sometimes wreck or burn a shop. Police broke up the crowds with tear gas and clubs. Knots of Mauritanians demanded to see ID cards and roughed up those who did not prove they were Mauritanian. <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION> straddles <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> north and black <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Two-thirds of its 2 million people are Moors of Arab-Berber extraction. The rest are black, mostly from the southern river region. <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>'s 7 million people almost all are black. In <LOCATION> Dakar </LOCATION>, many women and children sought refuge in the <ORGANIZATION> Mauritanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, Ambassador <PERSON> Mokhtar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ould </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamel </PERSON> said. They were escorted to the central mosque. Many have asked to be repatriated. Senegalese authorities said they arrested large numbers of vandals, but did not confirm reports that hundreds have been detained. This violence was sparked over the right of Senegalese to farm on a <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> island. Even before the colonial period, the black Toucouleur people farmed both sides of the <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. After both countries became independent from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1960, Senegalese Toucouleur continued to farm the Mauritanian side they had considered their own for generations. Moors to the north, traditionally nomadic herders, did not farm. But the recent completion of two dams on the river has opened up new farmland and spurred Mauritanian interest in agriculture. All along the border, Senegalese are being forced off the land.

 Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> joined a statewide appeal Tuesday to raise money for a statue of his brother <PERSON> John </PERSON>, saying he was glad the memorial focuses on the late president's birthday and not the day he was assassinated. `` We do not want to relive my brother's death. We want to remember his life,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said at a <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION> news conference that included the late president's daughter, <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlossberg </PERSON>, and Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The 8-foot bronze statue is being created by artist <PERSON> Isabel </PERSON> <PERSON> McIlvain </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sherborn </LOCATION>, whose design was chosen through a nationwide competition. It depicts <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> striding into a breeze, with his left hand tucked in his pocket. State Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> MacGovern </PERSON>, co-chair of a special legislative commission on the statue, said he was confident the sculpture would be unveiled by May 19, 1990, the 73rd anniversary of <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s birth `` At long last <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> will properly remember and note the wonderful contributions of this outstanding citizens and this political hero for so many of us on both sides of the political aisle,'' said <PERSON> MacGovern </PERSON>. About $ 60,000 has been raised so far of the overall fund-raising goal, <PERSON> MacGovern </PERSON> said. The overall goal of $ 400,000 includes maintenance funds and some scholarship money. Commission members say they want to raise the money in small donations from each of the state's 351 cities and towns rather than make corporate appeals. No public funds are to be used. `` They wanted this to be a presentation from the people. They did n't want it just to be something the state was funding,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, aide to state Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, co-chair with MacGovern. Although <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> never served in the state government, his brother said he had close ties to the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> political tradition. He said the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> family has been concerned that most tributes to <LOCATION> JFK </LOCATION> focus on Nov. 22, 1963, the day <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was shot, and he was pleased with the planned May dedication of the sculpture. `` Now on the grounds of the statehouse he loved <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> will stand ... forever young,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Schlossberg </PERSON> spoke briefly, saying the statue will `` encourage and inspire other people to dedicate their time and energy to public service.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said the statue and <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s life commemorate the importance of public service. `` One of the reasons I believe it's so important that we remember this man in this place in front of this historic building is it makes sure that here in the Commonwealth of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> we have a constant reminder of what public service is all about,'' he said.

<HEAD>Educators Appeal for More Independence for Universities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY BETH SHERIDAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An international group of bishops and educators urged the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> on Tuesday to safeguard academic independence in Roman Catholic universities. The appeal came at the conclusion of a weeklong meeting to assess a draft of a major <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> document on Catholic higher education. The draft has drawn sharp criticism from college officials who charge it could undermine academic freedom. Delegates from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which has the world's largest <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> college system, said at a news conference Tuesday they are optimistic the <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> will heed the representatives' wishes. But the final document must be approved by Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>. In a closing address to the conference, the pope called for a `` more strict and faithful collaboration'' between the universities and the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> hierarchy. The representatives, in a near-unanimous vote, said the document should contain non-binding guidelines that are general and inspirational, rather than specific. `` My impression is that the Congregation will do a major rewrite,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitz </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dayton </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, referring to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s Congregation for <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>. The first draft of the education document, issued in 1985, assigned church authorities some power over <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> colleges and universities to ensure that teachers adhered to church doctrine and `` uprightness of life.'' Those teachers judged not doing so would be subject to dismissal. The document, circulated to educators and bishops, drew strong protests, and a second draft was prepared and presented at the meeting this week. About 175 college presidents, bishops and education experts from 40 countries discussed the draft with <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials and came up with 10 recommendations for a third version. The new proposals say the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> document `` should be positive, inspirational and future-oriented'' and that <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> universities must be allowed to run themselves. `` Freedom of research and teaching must be recognized and respected,'' the proposals said. Deciding how `` Catholic'' a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> university must be is a touchy issue. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> under <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> is trying to eliminate the confusion it blames on the teaching of dissident theologians and to strengthen the church through emphasis on traditional principles. At the same time, many universities say they must allow exploration of new theories, however unorthodox, as part of their role as centers of research and study. Many of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said they were surprised to find the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> very receptive to their ideas. `` This is innovative as <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> congregations operate _ far more participatory,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Byron </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> `` We've gotten a step further down the line.'' Several representatives and <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials at the conference formed a 15-member committee that will review the third draft of the document this fall. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said it was significant that the Congregation would ask college officials for another opinion. But the college representatives and bishops at this week's meeting play only an advisory role, and <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials and the pope will decide the shape of the final paper

 A Silver Spring, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, man, who became the first patient in the country to receive a new heart and pancreas at the same time, was reported Tuesday in critical but guarded condition after his pancreas was surgically removed. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Katz </PERSON>, 45, a longtime diabetic whose pancreas had virtually destroyed his heart, underwent surgery Monday night to remove the pancreas because a peptic ulcer had developed on an adjoining section of bowel, <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Clare </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiore </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Katz </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> physicist, underwent surgery on March 25.

Tests are expected to be completed Friday that will determine what caused the ulcer. The pancreas itself will also be examined to determine if an infection existed and, if it did, contributed to the ulcer.

 A mob of 100 villagers drove off environmentalists who had chained themselves to a wharf for 19 hours to protest alleged pollution by the town's main employer, news reports said Tuesday. The four activists were roughed up and sprayed with water from firehoses after protesting against the ilmenite mine run by Titania A-S, which they say dumps ecologically damaging waste into a nearby fiord. The mine employs about 350 people in the town of 3,500 people. Environmentalists want the residues dumped on land instead of the ocean but Titania has said it obeys state guidelines. Titania, owned by N.L. <ORGANIZATION> Chemicals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Hightstown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, in 1983 became the object of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s first major protest against an alleged industrial polluter. `` I do n't understand why they were so furious.

 A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee on Wednesday approved a $ 1.4 billion bill reauthorizing the federal vocational training program, after first removing a requirement that certain amounts be set aside for certain groups. However, the measure stipulates that the states are to make sure the money is distributed in the most effective way that also insures fair treatment for particular segments of the population _ such as the physically handicapped, single parents and those who do not speak English. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration opposed writing into the law a specific amount to be spent on certain categories of people and the panel members had heard testimony prior to final action on the bill that the set-asides had not proved effective. The <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> Vocational Education Act of 1984, which expires Sept. 30, says 10 percent of the grants are to go to the handicapped, 22 percent to the disadvantaged, 12 percent to adults, 8.5 percent to single parents and homemakers, 3.5 percent to elimination of sex bias, and 1 percent to the incarcerated. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration had requested $ 949 million for fiscal year 1990, up from the current $ 918 million.

 Sworn statements about a dog that understood Estonian and trysts between a defense attorney and courtroom marshal are some of the odd turns a long trial of three leftist militants has taken. Tuesday was day 37 of testimony and arguments in the federal trial of two men and a woman accused of plotting to overthrow the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government by force. The charge also known as seditious conspiracy rarely has been used since it was invoked during the Civil War to prosecute Confederate loyalists. Despite the historical weight of the proceeding, which involves some of the major violent radicals of the 1970s, the dozen or so marshals guarding the courtroom usually far outnumber the few spectators. The 17-member jury yawned and fidgeted through Monday's skirmish between defendant <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Luc </PERSON> <PERSON> Levasseur </PERSON>, dressed in blue jeans, and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, a gray-suited <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> lawyer who was friends with some associates of the defendants when she studied at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> a decade ago. <PERSON> Levasseur </PERSON>, who is serving as his own lawyer, has accused <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> and others of informing on the radicals, who sometimes called themselves the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and are accused of bombing buildings and robbing banks around the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> from 1975 to 1981. `` I would like you to cooperate, although not as much as you did with the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Levasseur </PERSON> said, in the kind of bitter aside that jurors have come to expect of him. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> was the 91st witness on the stand, and prosecutors are only a quarter of the way into their witness list. <PERSON> Levasseur </PERSON>, 42, faces a maximum of 60 years in prison if convicted on three charges of seditious conspiracy, racketeering and racketeering conspiracy. On trial on the same charges are his wife, <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Gros </PERSON> <PERSON> Levasseur </PERSON>, 40, and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 41. There were seven defendants at the time of the initial jury selection in March 1988. Prosecutors dropped charges against <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Laaman </PERSON>, already serving lengthy sentences on other charges. <PERSON> Manning </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Manning </PERSON>, pleaded guilty to sedition and other charges, and a separate trial was ordered for <PERSON> Laaman </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Curzi-Laaman </PERSON>. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Loucks </PERSON> questioned <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> on April 13 about a dog she said former co-defendant <PERSON> Jaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Laaman </PERSON> had taught commands in Estonian. `` Did you ever hear him talk to the dog?'' Young asked her. She replied: `` A couple of commands, like sort of ` sit' and ` stop.''' Young later struck the comments, saying, `` I ca n't for the life of me see how that would be a statement made in furtherance of the conspiracy.'' Ms. <PERSON> Curzi-Laaman </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, and a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshal assigned to guard the courthouse during the trial were the subject of an April 7 hearing for their love affair during jury selection. A judge found that the pair had not discussed court business during the liaison.

 A delegation of Nicaraguan opposition leaders, ranging from an anti-Sandinista Communist to Contra rebel spokesmen, accused the Nicaraguan government Tuesday of laying the groundwork for a rigged presidential election next February. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> leveled similar charges and appealed to the <LOCATION> Sandinistas </LOCATION> to meet opposition demands for a more equitable process. The Nicaraguan delegation said the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> are attempting to ensure victory in the election by stacking the all-powerful <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in their favor and by denying the opposition equal access to media outlets. Twelve opposition leaders took part in a news conference, including <PERSON> Eli </PERSON> <PERSON> Altamirano </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and three members of the U.S.-supported Contra rebels. The occasion for their appearance was the deadline, established at a Central American summit meeting last February in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, for setting in motion an electoral process that will culminate in national elections 10 months from now. At the summit, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> promised to hold free and fair elections and the presidents agreed in return to draw up a plan for demobilizing the thousands of Contras assembled at camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> along the Nicaraguan border. The rebels have been subsisting on food and other non-lethal aid provided by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The Nicaraguan delegation had raised its concerns earlier about Sandinista policy toward the elections in meetings with officials from the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We have denounced in these meetings the lack of compliance by the government of President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> in relation to the commitments which they undertook in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Agustin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarquin </PERSON>, a representative of the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. He said Sandinista actions `` will not permit fair and honest political competition.'' <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonilla </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have agreed to name a non-partisan individual as head of the election council but that other aspects of the electoral machinery `` would remain dominated by the Sandinista front.'' <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Cecilia </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> said the new election laws were approved with the participation of the political parties represented in the legislature and are in compliance with the terms of the Central American summit meeting. In a telephone interview, she said the law allows opposition parties more airtime for campaign purposes than they would have received under their original request. In addition, she said, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>, consistent with another pledge made at the summit, have released about 1,700 National Guardsmen who served the rightist regime which was ousted by the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> a decade ago. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said the administration is troubled by both the substance of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s electoral laws and the manner in which they have been put into effect The electoral law approved last week `` is not the result of good faith bargaining between the government of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and the internal opposition groups, and was unilaterally imposed after being passed by the Sandinista-dominated legislature,'' she said. She said the law includes a provision requiring that the election council of which the Sandinistas maintain control receive one-half of any foreign political contributions. The law ignores, she said, proposals made by the internal opposition for absentee balloting and procedures for ensuring the presence and unlimited access of international election observers. A new law governing press conduct, she added, includes penalties for disseminating information which the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> determines to be a violation of national integrity and allows officials to order closures of up to four days.

<HEAD>Afghan Soldiers Kill 58 Guerrillas in Latest Jalalabad Attack</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The government said Tuesday that its forces killed 58 Moslem guerrillas mounting another attack on the eastern city of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> also said 250 guerrillas were killed in other fighting. His claims could not be independently verified. The Soviet ambassador to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> meanwhile reported thousands of casualties by both sides in the seven-week siege on <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, and he compared the intense shelling to that of the World War II battle of <LOCATION> Stalingrad </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Yuli </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> also said the offensive appears to have been orchestrated entirely by the Pakistani military, not by the government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>. `` I do n't think she's looking for a military solution,'' <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> said. `` I think she wants peace and quiet in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The Pakistani military has some thing else in mind. They want people who are going to be very obedient to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>.'' According to a report in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday, Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s government ordered the frontal assault on <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> last month despite opposition from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s military intelligence servicee. The newspaper said the decision was made in the presence of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON>. It said no resistance leaders were at the meeting. <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> has denied the allegations, and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has refused comment. President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> frequently has accused <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, its eastern neighbor, of armed aggression and interference in his country. `` I think it was entirely a plot of the Pakistani military,'' <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> said in an interview in the Soviet Embassy compound. Guerrillas fired a rocket into the compound Thursday, and the explosion shattered windows but caused no casualties among the 260 people staying there. `` If there is a second one,'' <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> warned, `` they will be sorry.'' `` We will reply swiftly and decisively,'' he said. `` Our reply is ready and it wo n't be in a diplomatic note.'' The guerrillas, who are armed and supported by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, began fighting to overthrow the pro-Soviet government shortly after it seized power in a 1978 coup. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> sent soldiers to support the government in 1979. More than 100,000 soldiers were in the country before <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> signed a U.N.-sponsored agreement. On March 6, three weeks after the last Soviet soldiers left <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, the insurgents launched the attack on <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, about 45 miles from the border with <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said government soldiers had inflicted heavy blows to the guerrillas in their latest attack. He said 58 guerrillas were killed and 49 others wounded since Monday night. One soldier also was killed and six civilians injured, he said. Elsewhere, the military killed 250 guerrillas and wounded 300 others in fighting in the southern city of <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> and two civilians died and six others were injured in the western city of <LOCATION> Herat </LOCATION>, he said. According to <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> has been hit by tens of thousands of rockets since the siege began. He said officials had calculated the rate of shelling was comparable to the battle of <LOCATION> Stalingrad </LOCATION>. He said more than 5,000 guerrillas have been killed and about another 3,500 have been injured. He also said about 2,500 soldiers had been killed or wounded and that the that the casualties among civilians also have been high, although he did not have any figures. `` If their aim is to find a place for their so-called government, they're not going to do it there,'' he said. The resistance in February formed an interim government in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Capturing <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> would give them a base on Afghan soil. <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> said he plans to continue contacts with with resistance leaders in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to reach a negotiated settlement. He said the issue would be brought up during Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>'s trip to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> next month. `` What surprises me is the line of the American adminstration,'' he said. `` In other parts of the world, they are interested in a political solution. Why are they playing another ball game here?''

<HEAD>North Lawyers Ask ``Appropriate Relief'' After NBC Letters to Jurors</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-North Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers asked the trial judge Tuesday to determine after the verdict how jurors might have been influenced by an <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> request to interview them after the trial ends. `` The defense further requests that the court grant appropriate relief after the hearing,'' said the motion filed by <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> while the jury was deliberating for the fourth day. On Saturday, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> hand-delivered letters to the jurors' homes, saying `` we would like to talk to you after the trial is over; please call us then.'' Learning of this, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> convened a hearing and called the attempt `` most inappropriate, improper conduct, quite disrespectful.'' In his motion, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> took note of <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>'s remark that one `` juror was angry and must have mentioned the fact to other jurors who immediately showed similar concern.'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said the hearing should determine `` whether the jurors' reaction to the letter has prejudiced defendant <PERSON> North </PERSON>. An <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said after <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>'s remarks that the network had meant no harm and had assumed the jurors would n't see the letters until after arriving home after the trial. Until they reach a verdict, the jurors are sequestered in a motel while not deliberating.

 Tourists said the capital's luxury hotels swayed like flagpoles in Tuesday's earthquake and it felt like a rollercoaster ride, frightening some so badly they cut short their vacations and headed for more stable ground. `` We were in bed and she thought I was shaking the bed and I thought the people next door were shaking the walls,'' said <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Giddings </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> as he and his wife, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>, checked out of the Hotel Krystal in the Zona Rosa tourist area. They were a day and a half into their honeymoon when the quake hit at 8:26 a.m. `` Once it really got going you could hear a rumble. It felt like a good rollercoaster ride,'' said <PERSON> Giddings </PERSON>. Two hairline cracks ran down the walls, one in the bedroom, one in the bathroom, popping chips of paint off the walls. Running down the stairs from their 10th floor room after the motion stopped, they saw chunks of plaster scattered about. They had planned to go to the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> coast resort of <LOCATION> Acapulco </LOCATION> but changed their minds when they heard the quake was centered near there. `` We're going anywhere in the States,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Giddings </PERSON> said, `` It's a terrifying experience.'' She said <LOCATION> Disneyworld </LOCATION> was one possibility. Tourists at other hotels said they saw other people checking out, cutting vacations short because of the quake, which measured 6.8 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale. Across the street, in the Century Hotel, Cobe Eekels-Bakker of <LOCATION> Amstelveen </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, at first thought she was ill, then noticed that everything was moving back and forth. `` I could see through my window stones and dirt coming down,'' she said. Although slowed by an already existing hip injury, she grabbed her purse and cane to run down the steps from her eighth-floor room. `` Everybody was going past me. Then somebody took me and brought me downstairs quickly,'' she said. `` I have cried,'' she said, sitting in the lobby more than an hour later, still shaken. The quake sloshed water from the hotel's rooftop pool, over the walls onto cars parked on the street 23 floors below. Three hours later, <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> and <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Westport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, who had been staying in the <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Isabel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheraton </PERSON>, said they decided to continue their vacation and go on to <LOCATION> Acapulco </LOCATION>. `` I'm still actually dizzy from it,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said. `` I do n't feel I have my legs under me yet.'' She remembered sitting in their sixth-floor room, waking up with a cup of coffee just before the quake. `` There was a Do Not Disturb sign on the inside of the door wiggling. I was sitting there, trying to wake up, wondering what was making the sign move.'' About five minutes later, the whole building began shaking. `` I felt like I was going to pass out. I was really frightened, it was a sort of panic attack,'' she said. But her husband, everyone agreed, stayed calm throughout. `` It was like being on the top of a flagpole,'' he said. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Cummings </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Selden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, recovering from a two-day bout of illness, tried to get out of bed when he heard the bathroom door bang and felt the building sway. `` It was strong enough to make me fall back down on my bed when I got up,'' he said. `` That's when I realized what was happening.'' <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Henley-on-Thames </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, had been in an earthquake in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> but said it was `` not as bad as this.'' She called her husband <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> from the bathroom of their 15th-floor room. `` We sat on the bed and held each other,'' she said. `` We could just see our building moving relative to the other buildings,'' he said. While it seemed like a lot, it looked like about a foot, he said.

 A Cuban family from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> that was stranded in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> after a sightseeing trip five months ago may soon be granted political asylum, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> immigration officials said Tuesday. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Fajardo </PERSON> has provided information that substantiates his claim that he would face political persecution if returned to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Benedict </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferro </PERSON>, district director of the federal <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is not a frivolous claim,'' <PERSON> Ferro </PERSON> said. `` We would not turn people away under those circumstances.'' <PERSON> Ferro </PERSON> would not discuss details of the case but did say that pending a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> review of the case, the Fajardos might be allowed to return in a few weeks. <PERSON> Fajardo </PERSON>, his wife, <PERSON> Bermaida </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora-Powers </PERSON>, and her two children, <PERSON> Yoradlys </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yoandys </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>, have lived on charity since Dec. 23, when they were denied re-entry into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at the <LOCATION> Rainbow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Niagara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> because they are illegal aliens. The couple told border authorities that they had driven north to find snow for Christmas and had ventured into <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> to view the falls. The family lived for several weeks in a <LOCATION> Niagara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, motel, then in a <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION> apartment under the sponsorship of <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> refugee groups. `` It looks like we may finally be able to work something out,'' said Sister <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Rimar </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fajardo </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Charities </ORGANIZATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>. Last month, <PERSON> Ferro </PERSON> denied <PERSON> Fajardo </PERSON>'s application to return to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on humanitarian parole. Despite pressure from charitable organizations and from Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., <PERSON> Ferro </PERSON> had insisted that the family not be readmitted because of their record of immigration fraud and other unspecified evidence Immigration officials said Tuesday <PERSON> Fajardo </PERSON> and his wife still are guilty of substantial fraud against the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government and other offenses. But they also said such violations can be overlooked in light of concern over possible persecution. Information regarding the potential for persecution for <PERSON> Fajardo </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, they added, was not available until he was allowed to enter the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> late last month for an interview with immigration officials in <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>. Sister <PERSON> Rimar </PERSON> said that, for the first time since December, the family has some hope of returning to the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> area. But their stay in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> has exhausted their resources, she said. `` Their situation is a mess,'' she said. `` They have no home or business to return to, and they're in danger of having their car repossessed. They'll have to start off basically with nothing and work their way back again.''

<HEAD>Gingrich Denies Helping Book Investors With Their Government Problems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 House Republican Whip <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said Tuesday that none of the 22 investors in a partnership created to promote a book he co-authored ever received `` unusual or extraordinary personal help'' from him in their dealings with the federal government. But <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, during a stormy news conference which his wife left in anger, acknowledged that some of the investors had a direct interest in legislation and that he had handled routine requests from some of them. While House rules prohibit members from accepting gifts worth more than $ 100 from people with direct interest in legislation, <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said the partnership did not violate <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules because the $ 5,000 that each investor put into the deal did not constitute a gift. Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, D-Ark., has filed a formal complaint with the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee alleging that the partnership involved 10 apparent violations of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules The committee has not indicated whether it will launch a preliminary investigation of the complaint. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, who initiated the investigation that led to <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s being charged with 69 violations of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules last week, said he was satisfied that each investor in the partnership `` thought there was a reasonable chance that it might make money.'' In exchange for their investments, the 19 individuals and three corporations that formed the <ORGANIZATION> COS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Limited </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partnership </ORGANIZATION> in 1984 were promised half of the publisher's profits from the book, `` Window of Opportunity,'' written by <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>; his wife, <PERSON> Marianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Drake </PERSON>. According to hundreds of pages of financial documents and tax returns released Tuesday by <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, the partnership spent $ 51,571 to promote and advertise the book from 1984 through 1986, but the publisher still had a net loss of $ 6,259 on the book by the end of 1987. Because the partnership received no profits from book sales, the $ 104,185 loss it generated from 1984 to 1988 was distributed among the partners, providing them with tax writeoffs. Mrs. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, as general partner of the partnership, received a $ 10,000 payment in 1984 for setting up the organization, and later received a 2 percent interest in the partnership and a $ 1,500 payment, according to the documents. She did not invest any of her own money in the partnership. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>'s complaint alleges in part that the payments and ownership interest in the partnership that Mrs. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> received were gifts that violated House rules limiting gifts members may receive. The complaint parallels the ethics committee's allegation that the salary and benefits <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON>, received from an investment corporation were actually gifts because there was no evidence that Mrs. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> did any work for the corporation. Mrs. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said Tuesday that she kept all the records for the partnership, interviewed potential investors to ensure they were qualified and handled the filings necessary to comply with various state securities laws. She left the news conference abruptly after telling reporters she was upset that no one seemed interested in going through the 350 pages of tax returns, financial records and incorporation papers that she had put together in response to questions about the book deal. <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> defended his wife, telling reporters that unlike Mrs. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, `` she actually did the work for the money she got.'' He said the 350 pages of documents `` represent her work product.'' <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> said he was willing to concede that the book partnership was `` unusual.'' But he said there was nothing `` unethical'' in the deal, which he described as markedly different from the financial arrangements for <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s book, `` Reflections of a Public Man.'' `` We wrote a real book, working with a real publisher distributed to real bookstores and sold to real people for a realistic, standard royalty,'' he said. `` <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> did none of those things.'' Part of the ethics committee's charges against <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> allege that he violated <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules on outside income limits though bulk sales of his book, on which he received a 55 percent royalty.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> engineer testified Tuesday that the cargo doors of the company's 747 jetliners are safe, but a colleague at <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> recalled a 1987 episode in which one of the doors partially opened in flight. The engineers spoke at a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> hearing on the February accident that tore the cargo door off a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> plane near <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, killing nine passengers. The opening session of the three-day hearing was dominated by detailed and technical testimony on the design and operation of the 800-pound cargo doors. `` The basic system has been a safe and reliable system for many, many years,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON>, a fuselage structural design manager for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which builds 747s in <LOCATION> Everett </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> said that testing after the 1987 episode, in which the cargo door came partially open in a flight from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, showed the door could open in mid-flight if there was damage to parts of the locking system. The plane involved in that incident returned safely to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> is looking into the Feb. 24 accident of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 811 </ORGANIZATION>, which lost the cargo door and part of its fuselage in an explosive decompression shortly after takeoff from <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. Nine passengers sitting above the cargo door were sucked out. Although two engines conked out, pilot <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> managed to land at <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> with no further loss of life. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> 747-100, built in 1970, was one of the first jumbo jets built by the Seattle-based company. It had over 58,800 flight hours. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON>, chairman of the hearing panel, said the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> is still studying the costs and benefits of retrieving the door of the craft from under nearly 17,000 feet of water in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, 85 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. There has been speculation the cargo door may have broken free when the latching mechanism failed. United records indicated there had been recent problems with the door before the accident, causing the door to be closed manually rather than electrically on several occasions. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> on March 3 issued an emergency order requiring all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines to reinforce within 30 days the relatively lightweight aluminum latch mechanisms with steel, so the doors would be less vulnerable to damage caused by improper closing.

 The absence of strong, untainted leaders in the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was a big reason Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> held on so long through a personally painful and damaging scandal. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, 65, was in power only 18 months and had to deal from his first days in office with the multimillion dollar scandal involving the Recruit information conglomerate. He announced Tuesday he will resign. That had been expected, but it still left the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which has been in control since 1948, foundering. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> was <ORGANIZATION> LDP </ORGANIZATION> president, and that assured him of becoming prime minister in November 1987 when Prime Minister <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakosone </PERSON> retired. And although the new <ORGANIZATION> LDP </ORGANIZATION> president could expect to become prime minister, the party is riddled with factions. `` Many of the leaders of factions inside the <ORGANIZATION> LDP </ORGANIZATION> are themselves involved in the Recruit scandal, so it would be difficult to find someone to take <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s place,'' said <PERSON> Seisaburo </PERSON> <PERSON> Sato </PERSON>, a political science professor at <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Unlike questions of personal finances in the 1970s that led to the resignation of Prime Minister <PERSON> Kakuei </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanaka </PERSON>, the Recruit scandal has scarred virtually all the <ORGANIZATION> LDP </ORGANIZATION> factions. Political analaysts said the plunge of <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s popularity in public opinion polls to less than 4 percent reflected broad opposition to the political system, often characterized by back-room dealings. `` I feel deeply responsible for having fostered such distrust,'' <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said in his resignation announcment. He said he would leave office after parliament approves the budget for fiscal 1989. The Recruit scandal created a stalemate in Parliament with a boycott of the budget debate by opposition members demanding former Prime Minister <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> be called for questioning about payments and stock deals by Recruit to politicians and the <ORGANIZATION> LDP </ORGANIZATION>. For many people the scandal revealed the extent of unreported money flowing between business and government. Analysts, noting the years the <ORGANIZATION> LDP </ORGANIZATION> has governed, suggested a system of `` structural corruption'' had been created. Some <ORGANIZATION> LDP </ORGANIZATION> members, including reform leader <PERSON> Masayoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Takemura </PERSON>, have said the party may not be able to end its dependence on large sums of money from the business world and maintain its dominance. `` Sometimes I think we may have to dissolve the party and start again from zero,'' <PERSON> Takemura </PERSON> said last week. <PERSON> Takako </PERSON> <PERSON> Doi </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, told other opposition leaders at a strategy session this month that the scandal offered a rare opportunity to wrest power from the <ORGANIZATION> LDP </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is a time of unprecedented importance,'' she said. <PERSON> Fuyuko </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamisaka </PERSON>, a prominent writer on women's and consumer issues, suggested in a television interview that an independent panel be appointed to supervise political reforms. `` I hope that someone not directly linked to the political world can lead a fundamental reform of politics that will eliminate the flow of ` strange' money,'' she said.

 Japanese Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s resignation likely will further delay action on the controversial FSX fighter project, official sources said Tuesday Some high-level sources suggested the end result could be a weaker deal for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, or a complete unraveling of the plan to jointly build a new fighter based on the American F-16. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s announcement that he would step down as a result of an influence-peddling scandal brings new uncertainty to the already-troubled FSX plan, said administration and congressional officials, all of whom declined to be identified. The sources suggested it is now unlikely there will be any movement in stalled negotiations on the project until a successor to <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> takes office. `` It's not on the verge of being resolved now anyway,'' said one administration soucre. `` We're continuing to try to clarify the conditions'' on the project set down a month ago by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators. `` It's proven to be a very difficult process.'' Although President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signaled general support for the joint venture in mid-March, Japanese officials balked at some of the conditions he stipulated _ including a guarantee that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies have a 40 percent share in the production of the new jet. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also wants assurances that any new technology developed from the project would be available to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, along with protection for U.S.-developed computer codes that help fly and control the plane. The agreement to co-develop the FSX, which stands for Fighter Support Experimental, was negotiated late last year between <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s government and the outgoing <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> adminstration. Under the agreement, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> would build the upgraded F-16 with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heavy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>. The plan encountered stiff opposition in the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, where critics have called it a $ 7 billion giveaway of high technology to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> _ suggesting the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would get little in return. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s resignation will make it `` harder to deal with the issue,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mo </LOCATION>. `` I think the position of the Japanese will be that, because they're in a difficult circumstance, they ca n't give as much as they might have on FSX,'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said in an interview. He also said that the Japanese government might use the current political turmoil there to its advantage in seeking <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concessions in other U.S.-Japanese trade disputes. Proponents of the FSX project claim it represents a way to add fighters to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s inventory in strategic northeast <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> at its own expense and would give the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> access to sophisticated radar technology developedby <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION>. One congressional source involved in trade issues said that any further delay in the project now would let <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> strengthen its negotiating hand. `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s final response on the FSX clearly had to be signed off on by the prime minister. But there was divided counsel in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> on the terms and he -LRB- <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> -RRB- obviously has been preoccupied. This will give them a chance to get their act together and play trade hardball.'' Any effort by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to demand further concessions from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could jeopardize a project that already has thin support in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, possibly torpedoing the plan entirely, said both administration and congressional sources. Traveling with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> was asked what impact <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s resignation might have on the FSX project. `` We do n't really know how it might affect that deal,'' he said. Asked if the White House still favored moving ahead with the agreement, with the new qualifications, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` Our position is the same, we still hope so.''

 Jungle rebels broke a six-month lull in their uprising by attacking a village, where they killed one man, kidnapped two others, and set fire to homes, the state news agency reported Tuesday. Witnesses said about 40 insurgents of a group known as the Jungle Commando attacked <LOCATION> Pokigron </LOCATION>, about 100 miles south of this capital city, early Sunday despite resistance by villagers armed with shotguns. The attackers beat, stabbed, and then shot a man they suspected to be an army spy, according to the state-run <ORGANIZATION> Suriname </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. The victim later died in the hospital. The rebels also burned some homes and kidnapped the village chief and a second man, the news agency said. The rebels doused the chief with gasoline and threatened to burn him alive but halted when villagers begged them to stop, the agency said. About 100 villagers fled to <LOCATION> Paramaribo </LOCATION> after the assault, the news agency said. The insurgents reportedly escaped. The attack was the most serious in this former Dutch colony on the northeastern coast of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> since cease-fire talks with the government of President <PERSON> Ramsewak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shankar </PERSON> stalled in October 1988. Witnesses said Sunday's attackers were led by <PERSON> Ronny </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunswijk </PERSON>, a one-time army private who began the uprising in 1986. More than 400 people, mostly civilians, have been killed in the rebellion. The insurgents have not publicly stated their grievances.

<HEAD>Iran Paper Supports Rafsanjani As Post-Khomeini Leader</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A prominent Iranian newspaper on Tuesday backed <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> to head a leadership council that would eventually succeed the 88-year-old <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. The state-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Ettelaat </ORGANIZATION> daily said in an editorial that no single possible substitute for <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> existed `` when it comes to knowledge and jurisprudence especially in the area of government... or when such other factors as record of struggle or political intuition is concerned. It suggested a leadership council made up of present state administrators and leading religious authorities in which one member `` would be capable of saying the last word on matters of dispute and able to adopt decisions on his own responsibility.'' `` If we were to make a decision on the basis of a grade point average of a candidate it seems ... <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> has the necessary qualifications for heading the leadership council,'' <ORGANIZATION> Etelaat </ORGANIZATION> said. `` In all countries and with every leadership council there is one member entitled to veto the vote of the rest.'' It was the first public backing for a <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> successor since <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> forced <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Hossein </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Montazeri </PERSON> to step down last month as his officially designated successor. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> is a leading candidate for president in elections scheduled to be held this year to choose a successor to <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, who is not permitted by the constitution to run for a third four-year term. But under <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s present system, the president divides power with the prime minister and <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, all of them subject to the authority of <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. The revolutionary patriarch's separate status as spiritual leader is unmatched and unlikely to be filled after he dies, Iranian political experts say. <ORGANIZATION> Ettelaat </ORGANIZATION>'s endorsement significantly boosts <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s status in current political infighting. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> kept a low profile in a recent purge of moderates and in the international outcry over <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s death sentence decree for British author <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> is considered a pragmatist able to maneuver between hard-line theologians and others who wanted to soften the harsh Islamic revolution and end <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s international isolation. On Friday, he announced the discovery of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spy network including senior Iranian naval officers, a move apparently aimed at gaining points with the hardliners. On Saturday, <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, 54, who also holds the post of acting commander in chief of the armed forces, received backing for his presidential campaign from an influential party of hardliners, the Assembly of Combatant Theologians. And on Monday, <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> included <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> in a 20-man committee given two months to `` rectify defects'' in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s 1980 revolutionary constitution. One task, <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> said, was to consider the leadership question. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> has been campaigning for a constitutional change giving the president more power and abolishing the prime ministry. Prime Minister <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> meanwhile said Tuesday that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spy network which <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> reported uncovered recently had direct contact with <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> offices in neighboring countries. Some agents communicated with the Americans through West German embassies in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, he said. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, quoted <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> as saying in an interview with the state-owned <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> that the West Germans `` should know their embassies are at the service of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> spy network.'' He said some agents were in `` sensitive positions'' with access to top secret information which they passed on to the Americans, the radio reported. <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> said the purported <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> actions violated the <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> agreement, which stipulates non-interference by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in each other's domestic affairs. He was apparently referring to a 1980 accord under which <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> released 52 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats held hostage in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> for 444 days. <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would lodge a complaint against <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> at the Hague.

<HEAD>Panel's Chairman Asks Members to Resist Lobbyists' Pressure</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, on the eve of public sessions to write savings and loan bailout legislation, privately appealed to fellow Democrats Tuesday to resist pressure from industry lobbyists or face the anger of taxpayers. Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, at a closed-door caucus of the panel's Democrats, urged support for requiring S & amp; L owners to back their lending with more of their own money, calling it `` the litmus test on whether anything has changed'' and `` the guts of this whole issue.'' Capital investment from S & amp; L stockholders acts as a cushion, absorbing losses that would otherwise have to be paid by government deposit insurance. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> is attempting to persuade his 51-member committee to toughen the standards passed earlier this month by the panel's 47-member subcommittee on financial institutions, chaired by Rep. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON>, D-Ill. More than 100 amendments are pending before the committee, which in sessions scheduled Wednesday and Thursday is expected to re-hash many of the battles fought during during 32 hours of subcommittee deliberations <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, who is joined by Rep. <PERSON> Chalmers </PERSON> <PERSON> Wylie </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, the panel's senior <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION>, would require institutions to hold $ 2.25 in `` tangible'' or `` real money'' capital for every $ 100 in loans, compared with $ 1.50 in versions of the legislation passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee and the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` Inadequate capital standards simply mean that we let the industry, once again, roll the dice with the taxpayers' money,'' he said in a statement prepared for delivery at the caucus. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> is trying to raise the visibility of the complex capital issue, which is at the heart of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s savings and loan proposal. In the past, industry lobbyists have heavily influenced congressional decisions on banking laws because most voters do n't follow the issues. With taxpayers picking up the bulk of the 10-year, $ 157 billion <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L bailout, however, <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> told his colleagues that ` the decisions will be tough _ and they will be watched.'' `` The choice may be difficult, but, as Democrats, we had better be able to say, ` When the choice was presented, we sided with the taxpayers,''' he said. Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass., predicted, `` The capital standards are going to look pretty kosher to the president by the time we're through `` There's intense lobbying by people in the industry, but I also think ... there's a view that if the committee votes $ 100 billion without a tough bill, sooner or later the public will react,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, who is supporting <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>' capital amendment. However, Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> LaFalce </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, argued that <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> was trying to precipitously impose `` lily white, absolutely pure'' standards on S & amp; Ls. He warned that if S & amp; Ls were not permitted to gradually improve their condition, the government's list of troubled institutions will swell. `` I honestly believe that if we prescribe this medicine for our troubled financial system, the medicine will be so strong that it will, if not kill the system, at least exacerbate the problem multifold,'' he said. In addition to raising the tangible capital requirement, <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> is also trying to tighten two other standards: one affecting an accounting item known as `` goodwill,''' the other the treatment of S & amp; L subsidiaries. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, more than one-third of the S & amp; L industry's $ 60 billion in capital consists of `` goodwill,'' an intangible asset representing the value of an institution's customer loyalty and name recognition. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is seeking to eliminate `` goodwill'' value over 10 years, arguing that it is `` phantom capital'' and has no worth when an institution is shut down. The bill passed by <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON>'s subcommittee would permit goodwill, in some cases, to remain on institutions' books for as long as 40 years. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> is proposing it be phased out over 20 years. The <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> plan gives S & amp; Ls five years to come up with extra capital to back subsidiaries investing in risky areas such as commercial real estate and junk bonds. The subcommittee bill did not require the extra capital. The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, based on a staff document, reported Monday that <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> would permit subordinated debt _ money <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls borrow _ to count for up to one-half of an institution's core capital. Aides explained Tuesday, however, that while subordinated debt will be permitted in capital, it will not be counted toward meeting the very minimum, or core, requirement.

<HEAD>Agency Will Tell Court Owl Worthy Of Protection</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it has dediced after all that the spotted owl is worthy of protection as a threatened species. Environmentalists hope the decision will save the ancient forests of the Northwest. The timber industry says the move could lock up vast areas of the region to logging. A federal judge in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> had given the agency until Monday to review its decision of more than a year ago not to list the owl under the Endangered Species Act. `` We will present a finding to the court that listing of the owl as a threatened species is warranted and begin steps to officially propose it for listing,'' said <PERSON> Meg </PERSON> <PERSON> Durham </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Once the owl is proposed for listing as a threatened species, a year-long review will begin during which management plans for protection of the bird could be developed and public comment sought. Ms. <PERSON> Durham </PERSON> offered no indication when the agency would actually propose the listing, but said the `` best scientific evidence'' available confirms the owl was worthy of protection. The Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in December 1987 refused to list the owl and environmental groups filed suit. District Court Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Zilly </PERSON> ruled the initial decision not to list the owl was `` arbitrary and capricious'' and gave the agency until May 1 to review its decision. The bird, which is thought to nest only in the old-growth forests of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, has become the focal point of a raging dispute between environmentalists and the timber industry. Environmentalists have sought to have the owl protected as part of their campaign to halt logging in the old-growth forests of the <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> while the industry has claimed such protection would close vast areas of the region to logging forcing dozens of mills to close and the layoff of thousands of workers. Court orders in related cases have already put a halt to more than 140 timber sales in the region's national forests. <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officals have said those injunctions would interupt half of the harvest planned in the national forests this year and during the long-term the harvest could drop by one-third. <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> chief, has said under a `` worst case scenario'' more than 31,000 workers could loose their jobs and his agency's timber receipts from the region could be cut in half. `` They should have done it a year ago, but better late than never,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, adding his his group believes listing the owl as an endangered species will require an end to logging in most of the remaining old-growth forests of the Northwest. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Pissot </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> said the decision gives the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> an `` opportunity to focus on some of the real threats to the timber industry rather than using the spotted owl as a scapegoat.'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, said the industry was `` disappointed, primarily because we do n't believe the facts warrant it. `` We believe there will be ramifications to this decision we just do n't begin to understand yet,'' said <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>. `` We believe it was a grave error.''

 Police Chief <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, who plans to retire in July, wants to work for federal drug czar <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, but on Tuesday he did n't rule out running for mayor of the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, 53, announced he will retire July 31, wrapping up a 32-year career with the police department. He said he had no immediate future plans. On Tuesday, top business officials contemplated drafting <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> to run in the 1990 mayoral election, while city officials said he wants to work for <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>. `` Mr. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> has not offered me a job,'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said, `` But he needs people who have been on the working level of a police agency _ on the ground floor.'' Asked about a mayoral candidacy, <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said, `` That's a possibility.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> denied Tuesday he was interfering in Greek politics after the conservative opposition party accused him of supporting the governing Socialists. A statement issued by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> said Ambassador <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keeley </PERSON> had steered clear of local politics since he was assigned to the country 3 -LCB- years ago. `` Ambassador <PERSON> Keeley </PERSON> has made it the foundation of his service in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> ... to make clear to everyone in this country that the politics of <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> are for the <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> people alone to determine, that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government does not take sides,'' the statement said.

A Western diplomat was also quoted as saying it was not yet clear who would win the June elections, despite the <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> government's loss of popularity because of allegations that officials were involved in a multimillion dollar financial scandal.

<HEAD>Former VA Inspector Used Professional Judgment, GAO Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Congressional investigators have cleared the former inspector general of the veterans administration of tailoring audit decisions to meet political or administrative pressure. A report from the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said the decisions of <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sato </PERSON> to end audits or not issue reports in nine instances, and his conclusions in those cases, were exercises of professional judgment and results of a policy `` not to issue reports that, in his judgment, would not accomplish a useful purpose.'' Anonymous complaints from people in <PERSON> Sato </PERSON>'s office to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Sato </PERSON>, inspector general from 1981 to 1988, had not issued reports or else had changed conclusions in eight cases under pressure from the agency's administrators, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> before 1986 or <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Turnage </PERSON> in 1986-1988. The staff of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> asked the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> to examine those eight cases plus one more it was concerned about. `` While not taking a position as to whether the former IG reached the right decision in each case, we recognize that when dealing with sensitive, controversial issues, reasonable people can, and often do, arrive at different conclusions. ... We believe this is the central issue here,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report dated March 17 and received Tuesday. In four cases, <PERSON> Sato </PERSON> wrote a memo to or briefed the administrator, either <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> or <PERSON> Turnage </PERSON>, or wrote to program officials about his findings. In five cases the report or other document was listed as available to the public. According to the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report, <PERSON> Sato </PERSON> `` said that in sensitive subject areas, he did not want to create controversy unless it would lead to improvements'' and expressed frustration about `` recommending that a VA facility not be built, when it was already determined by the agency and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that the facility was needed and would be built to help meet the agency's mission, despite any IG recommendation to the contrary.'' <PERSON> Sato </PERSON>, now retired, said `` he was never asked or directed by anyone else, including the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> administrator, to cancel or not issue an audit report, or to water down a report,'' and all decisions were his own, the report said. Only two of 50 people interviewed in the inspector general's office believed there was `` an independence problem,'' and those two did not provide `` evidence to show the former IG was impaired in his reporting decisions,'' <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report by <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinhoff </PERSON>, director of financial management system issues, said `` in the future, reasons for not issuing reports should be documented and placed in the -LRB- office -RRB- files.'' New audit standards issued last year require such a memo, and the acting <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> inspector general, <PERSON> Renald </PERSON> <PERSON> Morani </PERSON>, has agreed to follow such a policy, <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said.

 A policeman sentenced to 14 years in prison for the murder of pro-Solidarity priest <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Popieluszko </PERSON> has been freed after serving about four years, it was announced Tuesday. <PERSON> Waldemar </PERSON> <PERSON> Chmielewski </PERSON> was one of four security officers convicted of killing the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> priest in 1984 and dumping the body in the <LOCATION> Vistula </LOCATION> river north of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. The three other officers were given longer sentences and remain in prison. Deputy government spokesman <PERSON> Zbyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Rykowski </PERSON> said <PERSON> Chmielewski </PERSON> had been released, but he did not know when he left the penitentiary. He said <PERSON> Chmielewski </PERSON>'s sentence expired during the third week in April. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, citing humanitarian grounds in a 1987 ruling, reduced the sentence to four years. <PERSON> Chmielewski </PERSON> was sentenced in February 1985 to 14 years. <PERSON> Popieluszko </PERSON> was an active supporter of Solidarity, the independent union chartered by the communist government in the fall of 1980 during nationwide strikes. Solidarity was suspended by the government in December 1981 and subsequently outlawed by Parliament. But it was restored as a legal union federation under an agreement between the government and opposition groups led by <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> earlier this month. <PERSON> Popieluszko </PERSON> became a symbol of Solidarity's struggle, and his grave at the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> church where he served is a pilgrimage site for Poles and foreigners. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> placed flowers on the grave last weekend.

 The countdown began Tuesday for Friday's launch of space shuttle Atlantis and five astronauts on a mission to send a payload to <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> and revitalize a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> planetary exploration program. The $ 550 million Magellan-Venus project will mark the end of a decade-long dry spell for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> planet flights and signal the beginning of a science-rich three-years when four major probes will be rocketed into deep space. Liftoff is scheduled for 2:24 p.m. Friday in a rare afternoon launch. Only five of the 28 earlier shuttle flights took off after noon. The countdown clock began ticking on time at 8 a.m., when electrical power surged into the spaceship. Test director <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Willingham </PERSON> reported there were no problems as the count began. He said work Tuesday included checking computer software, the main engines and communications systems and closing out the engine compartment. He said the forecast was for clear skies Friday afternoon, but officials were expressing some concern about the possibility of strong crosswinds that could interfere with Atlantis if it had to make an emergency landing on a runway near the launch pad. The astronauts flew here late Tuesday from their training base in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> to make final preparations for launch. Commander <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> told reporters the crew and spacecraft are ready to fly and that `` we are mighty proud'' to be part of the first shuttle planetary mission. The other crew members are pilot <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Grabe </PERSON> and mission specialists <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleave </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Thagaard </PERSON>. Six hours after Atlantis lifts off, commander <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> and his astronaut crew will release the 7,600-pound <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> payload, propelling it on a 468-day journey to <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> is to slip into orbit around the cloud-shrouded planet in August 1990 and map up to 90 percent of its surface during the following 243 days with a high resolution radar system. The images, relayed to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and enhanced by computer, could help scientists understand how <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> was formed and evolved. They are expected to show features as small as 120 yards across, 10 times sharper than any previous pictures of the planet. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> project scientist at <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Jet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Propulsion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>, said it is hoped the expedition will answer `` a major question of why <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> evolved so differently even though at the beginning of the solar system they were almost identical.'' The surface temperature of <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s sultry twin is 900 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than that on Earth. <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> is the first new American planetary spacecraft since Pioneer 13 was launched in 1978, also to <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>. It also is the first planetary payload to be carried by a shuttle. The launch is being hailed as a resurgence of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s planetary science program. In October, another Atlantis crew will start the <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> spacecraft on the way to <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION>; in October 1990, the Ulysses probe will be launched, also from <LOCATION> Atlantis </LOCATION>, to study the sun, and in 1992, the Mars Observer craft will be on its way aboard an unmanned rocket.

 Guards tore down an office wall at <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday to remove four men protesting the cost of the only government-approved drug aimed at halting the AIDS virus. `` We wo n't let them tell us ` Pay or die' any longer,'' said protester <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Staley </PERSON>, who has been diagnosed as having AIDS-related complex and takes the drug, AZT. `` Either they knock down the cost or they knock down their own walls to get us out.'' <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> security guards and <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's deputies did just that after the four activists from the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, or ACTUP, sealed the door of an unoccupied office The protesters used small steel plates bolted to the door and door frame to seal the door. They planned to cut through a window in the second-floor office and unfurl a banner that would be visible from nearby Interstate 40. While the officers cut through the wall about 30 minutes after the protest began, the activists chained themselves together inside the room. The chain was cut before the four men, all wearing suits and ties, were led out of the company headquarters in handcuffs. `` We've been trying to deal with this company for two years,'' <PERSON> Staley </PERSON> said as he was put in a patrol car. <PERSON> Staley </PERSON> said the protesters wanted a 25 percent reduction in the cost of AZT and wanted <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> to fund a government program to supply AZT to the needy. The drug AZT, marketed by <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> under the name Retrovir, costs $ 8,000 to $ 10,000 a year. It prevents the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome from replicating, but is not a cure for the fatal disease. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, a spokesman for the New York-based coalition, said <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> recovered its development costs for AZT in the first year it was marketed and was now making an 80 percent profit on the drug sales. `` They could afford to practically give the drug away free,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` We're not denying that they deserve a profit, but we say it should be a reasonable profit on a drug people need to stay alive.'' <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> did not deny the 80 percent profit claim, but said the company had never released profit figures and did not know `` where that information came from.'' She said <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> has given away millions of capsules of AZT for clinical trials and had donated money to government AIDS programs. `` We understand their actions were motivated by desperation,'' Ms. <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> said. `` But it was really misdirected. <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> has been working for three years to bring therapy to AIDS patients.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the group was prepared to pay <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> for damages to the office. The protest, he said, was `` a desperate act to draw attention to the AIDS issue. Until they agree to our demands, we will continue to take these actions. We'll be back.'' AZT was rushed into production in 1986 after only nine months of clinical tests, when preliminary results showed 8 percent of the patients died while taking the drug, compared with 40 percent who died while taking a placebo. The government waived large-scale clinical tests after those preliminary results so the drug could be put into circulation. <PERSON> Staley </PERSON>, 28, a former Wall Street bond trader; <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Arsenault </PERSON>, 41, a clothing importer from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> who has AIDS; <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON>, 32, a dance club owner from <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Blane </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosley </PERSON>, 24, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> clothing designer, were charged with first-degree trespassing and damage to property. They were released on $ 5,000 bond each and face a court appearance May 4.

 Shock TV host <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said Tuesday he was attacked by `` skinheads'' who cut his hair and marked him with swatiskas, but police said they could n't verify his report. `` What he's claiming does n't appear to be the case at all,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, a spokesman at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> where the incident was reported at 11:30 p.m. Monday. `` We have not yet been able to confirm any of the statements Mr. <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> made.'' Authorities found no evidence of skinheads in the area, he said. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said a witness reported seeing the talk show host in a restroom where the attack was said to have happened, but did n't see any confrontation. The witness said <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> was escorted to a waiting limousine by a man and woman with whom he was traveling. <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> was cleanly dressed when found in the limousine at the airport and showed no signs of being in a scuffle, said <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. Scissors and a marking pen were found in the restroom, but there were no physical signs of a fight, he said. In an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> displayed swastikas scrawled across his face, shirt and pants. His right eye was bloodshot and bruised, his head partially cut. <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> said he was standing in front of a restroom urinal when someone `` put his arm around my throat and his other hand across my eyes and dragged me to a stall. They sat me down on the toilet. One guy sat on me, and another one started cutting my hair.'' He said they used one of his catch phrases, `` Do n't get mad, get even,'' and told him he now `` was one of them.'' <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> said he did n't get a good look at his assailants, but believed them to be skinheads, or young people with shaved heads. White supremacist skinheads have been reviled on the syndicated `` <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. Show.'' According to <PERSON> Downey </PERSON>, his attackers tried to shave his hair and drew swastikas across his face, sweatshirt and pants. <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> _ known for his aggressive, blatantly arrogant approach to the talk show format _ said one youth punched him, but that he managed to strike back. `` One of them's hurt,'' <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> said. `` I kicked him real good.'' The incident was reported about two hours after <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> taped a public service message condemning hate. <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> to promote his show, which is broadcast weeknights on cable via New Jersey-based <ORGANIZATION> WWOR-TV </ORGANIZATION> and aired locally on KOFY-TV. About the same time <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> said he was assaulted, a bomb threat forced <ORGANIZATION> KOFY </ORGANIZATION> to take the show off the air for half an hour. The nature of the threat was not known. The one-hour series was making its first appearance in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> since being canceled Sept. 9 by another station, <ORGANIZATION> KRON-TV </ORGANIZATION>, after a 13-week trial that was vociferously protested by local gay activists. <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> headed home to <LOCATION> Secaucus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, on Tuesday. He said he would n't miss taping any of his shows and wo n't wear a wig to cover up his `` haircut.''

<HEAD>South African Opposition Tells Defense Minister to Resign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Opposition spokesmen on Tuesday urged the defense minister to resign because of a purported arms deal between <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> extremists from <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and a South African diplomat. The opposition parties also demanded criminal charges against the diplomat in part to show good faith to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, which is upset because the transaction reportedly involved delivery of spare parts for its Blowpipe missile launcher. French authorities said they took South African diplomat <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Storm </PERSON> into custody last week with an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and three members of the <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the largest paramilitary group in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. French authorities said they were arrested in a raid on a hotel room where parts of the British-made missile system were being delivered to the South African. The three Irishmen and the American, identified as <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernhart </PERSON>, are being held on charges of gun-running and conspiracy. Storm, who is posted in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, was released after claiming diplomatic immunity. <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Eglin </PERSON>, foreign affairs spokesman for the moderate opposition <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said if Storm was involved `` in murky arms deals with terrorist organizations, there is no doubt the minister of defense should resign.'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> and Defense Minister <PERSON> Magnus </PERSON> <PERSON> Malan </PERSON> both have said the government sometimes uses unconventional methods to obtain arms technology to circumvent a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> arms embargo, but both denied <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> was supplying arms to any terrorist organization. They have said Storm's activities will be investigated. Published reports in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> say <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has supplied arms to Protestant groups in return for blueprints of the Blowpipe, a shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missile made at <ORGANIZATION> Short </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION>, a factory in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s defense spokesman, <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Dalling </PERSON>, said Storm should be charged as soon as he returns to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to hash out the whole affair in an open court. `` Presumably, it is a criminal offense for a South African citizen to conduct arms dealings with terrorist organizations,'' said <PERSON> Dalling </PERSON>. He said such a step would demonstrate to the British government <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s good faith. Spokesmen for the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> opposition have also called for a government explanation. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on Tuesday, Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> told <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s visiting finance minister, <PERSON> Barend </PERSON> <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Plessis </PERSON>, that he viewed with `` the utmost seriousness'' any supply of arms to violent groups in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s strife-torn province of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. The reports, embarrassing for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, are clouding what <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> officials have claimed is a successful policy by Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> toward <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. She refuses to impose tough embargoes while pressing the white-controlled government to share political power with the black majority. The Citizen, a pro-government newspaper in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, said, `` Whatever happens now, the incident will affect our credibility as a country opposed to terrorism in any shape or form.'' The government accuses the major armed opponent of its apartheid system of racial segregation, the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, of engaging in terrorism.

 The second strong earthquake in nine days hit a mountainous area of southwest <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on Tuesday, destroying a bridge and causing the top floors of five apartment buildings to collapse, an official report said. There were no immediate reports of casualties from the quake that struck in <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> province's <LOCATION> Batang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>, the state-run <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said. In <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, a moderate earthquake rocked the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> area early Wednesday, but police had no immediate reports of injuries or damage. The Chinese news agency said Tuesday's quake measured 6.7 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, the same as an earthquake that hit the same region April 16. Eleven people were killed in the April 16 earthquake and its aftershocks. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said a bridge across the <LOCATION> Jinsha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> was destroyed and an army vehicle loaded with relief supplies for <LOCATION> Batang </LOCATION> was damaged by a landslide. The epicenter of the Japanese quake was an estimated 40 miles below the surface in northern <LOCATION> Chiba </LOCATION> prefecture, adjoining <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. It had a preliminary reading on 5.1 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meteorological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said. There was no danger of tsunami, or huge ocean waves, generated by the quake, the meteorological agency said. The <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude. An earthquake of 5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale can cause considerable damage in the local area. A 7 reading is a `` major'' earthquake, capable of widespread heavy damage.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> on Tuesday asked for an emergency meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to hear its claim of `` flagrant intervention'' by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in its economy and political system. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Leonardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kam </PERSON>, requested the council meeting. A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a meeting might take place later this week. <PERSON> Kam </PERSON>, in a letter, did not specify the cause of the complaint, referring only to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> actions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s `` sovereignty, political independence, economic security and territorial independence.'' <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; World Report said in its May 1 issue that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> secretly approved a $ 10 million fund for Panamanian opposition candidates in the May 7 elections. Opposition candidate <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> on Monday denied receiving any campaign funds from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> is running against <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Duque </PERSON>, who is backed by Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> commander and de facto ruler. The opposition has accused <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> of planning to rig the May 7 vote, in which Panamanians will choose a new president, two vice presidents, 67 legislators and 510 local representatives. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported this week that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> approved a plan to have U.S.-supported Panamanian exiles overthrow <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, but the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> balked at the plan. The Times, quoting government officials, reported the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> rejected the coup plan, however, on grounds that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> might be assassinated. A presidential order forbids <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> participation in assassinations. Asked about the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> News report, <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION> officials refused comment, saying it involves covert operations. Last year, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration imposed economic sanctions in an attempt to force out <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The sanctions were imposed after <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was indicted on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug trafficking charges in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and he orchestrated the ouster of President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> had tried to fire <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> after the February 1988 indictment. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> denied the drug charges. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has blamed the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s economic problems and accused <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> of trying to renege on a treaty to transfer control of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> by the end of the century.

 An <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> veterinarian and a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> importer pleaded guilty Tuesday to two felony charges each in the unlawful importing of unapproved animal drugs. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Clack </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pittsfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> Dall </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ossining </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, could be jailed for up to 10 years, with <PERSON> Dall </PERSON> facing fines of more than $ 500,000 and <PERSON> Clack </PERSON> up to $ 260,000. <PERSON> Clack </PERSON> pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy and another of making a false statement in the hearing before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dall </PERSON> pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge and another stemming from the importing of the illegal drug chloramphenicol. More than a dozen additional charges against both men will be dropped when they are sentenced July 18. <PERSON> Clack </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dall </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jeffery </PERSON> <PERSON> Engel </PERSON>, president of the now defunct Custom Feed Blenders of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dodge </LOCATION>, were charged last November with conspiring to ship tons of cheap, outlawed toxic drugs from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> to animal feed manufacturers and veterinarians throughout the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. The antibiotics are mixed with feed to prevent the spread of disease in animals. <PERSON> Engel </PERSON> earlier pleaded guilty to three counts. Two of the 16 drugs that <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dall </PERSON> were charged with smuggling into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are prohibited from being used in any food animal, while three are prohibited in hogs or cattle because of their toxicity. The government says four others are carcinogens and one, chloramphenicol, is a powerful antibiotic which has been linked to aplastic anemia, a leukemia-like blood disorder. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Teske </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterinary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Rockville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, said that chloramphenicol is so potent that any dose is critical. `` If you are sensitive to it, even a very tiny amount would be enough to trigger this response,'' he said. He said the chemical is a broad spectrum antibiotic made in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> or Eastern European countries.

 The Communist Party swept out 110 senior officials _ many thought to be inactive and conservative _ and promoted 24 people Tuesday in a major reshuffle that expands <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s power base to push for reform. The party's policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> retired 74 of its 301 full members, including former President <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>; 24 non-voting members and 12 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auditing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which handles party finances. Party ideology chief <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> told a news conference they volunteered to step down and the Central Committee unanimously approved. At a full meeting of the committee, the officials issued a joint request that referred to President <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s campaign for perestroika, or restructuring: `` Now that all comrades on the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auditing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> should work hard to further perestroika, it is essential for us, in the interest of the common cause, to give up -LRB- our -RRB- powers.'' <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> remarked, `` This is a serious and important milestone in our course, perestroika, which shows that our party is realistically assessing its own work and is quite critical about its own activities.'' The resignations followed the first contested, nationwide elections in 70 years of Communist rule on March 26. Dozens of top party and government officials, including more than 30 regional party chairmen, were defeated. It was not clear whether <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had urged the officials to step aside Tuesday, but portraying their removal as voluntary was a deft tactical maneuver possibly meant to head off criticism that they wee ousted. The military lost a substantial voice in the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. At least nine senior officers were dropped, and just one officer was promoted from candidate status to full membership. The changes left the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> with 251 members, party personnel chief <PERSON> Georgy </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Razumovsky </PERSON> told the news conference. <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> said 83 members, or more than one-quarter of the body, lost the government and party jobs that entitled them to committee membership since the 27th party cngress elected them in 1986. Officially, they lost their jobs because of poor health or age, but some clearly fell from political favor. Of the 83, many were removed Tuesday. <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> said a few others were too ill to sign the request. Western observers call such inactive officials `` dead souls'' and say they can be a conservative force slowing reforms. The term was borrowed from <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Gogol </PERSON>'s 1842 novel `` Dead Souls'' about a rogue who buys the names of dead serfs to mortgage them as property. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hough </PERSON>, a political scientist at <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION>, has said `` dead souls'' are accumulating at a rate of about 10 percent a year and by 1991, more than half the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> members would fall into that category. All but two of those promoted Tuesday to full membership were made non-voting members at the 1986 party congress, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s first as general secretary The reshuffling between party congresses was extremely rare. Among others <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> might like to have on board in the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> are six men named party leaders in the Baltic republics of <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> republics of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. All are potential <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> allies but can not be appointed until a 1991 party congress. The six republics have been wracked by ethnic unrest. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has complained that opposition to his social and economic reform program, known as perestroika, extends all the way to the Central Committee. The body has included many officials who held spots there long before he became party leader in March 1985. In a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, the 58-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> chief praised the retirees for working hard for perestroika. `` Many of us had to give up our habits and stereotypes of thinking. And still, at this time of utmost importance for the development of our society, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> rose to the occasion,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. But in remarks carried by the Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, he added, `` The situation has changed considerably, comrades. Vast changes have taken place over this period also in state bodies, and this required personnel changes.'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the retirees included <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>, who had retired as president last fall; former <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION> members <PERSON> Geidar </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Aliev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomentsev </PERSON> and former non-voting Politburo member <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolgikh </PERSON>. Also dropped were <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sokolov </PERSON>, who was retired as defense minister in 1987 after West German teen-ager <PERSON> Mathias </PERSON> <PERSON> Rust </PERSON> flew a plane onto Red Square, and <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Demirchyan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kyamran </PERSON> <PERSON> Bagirov </PERSON>, who lost their jobs as first secretary of the Armenian and <LOCATION> Azerbaijani </LOCATION> parties respectively in ethnic unrest last May. Among those promoted were <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Velikhov </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> and thought to be a close <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> supporter; the ambassador to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Yuli </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kvitsinsky </PERSON>, an arms control expert who negotiated on space weapons with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Primakov </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> and International Relations.

<TEXT>
 Defense Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> on Tuesday predicted `` a very real likelihood'' that <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reform plans would fail and the Soviet leader may either be forced to change course or hand over power <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that as a result, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies must resist the temptation to respond to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s proposals for reducing arsenals and troop strengths and stick to the policies it has advocated until now <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION>, testifying before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said he had watched <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and had `` become convinced that he seeks change inside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but primarily because the Soviet system has been a failure.'' However, `` I think it's going to be extremely difficult for him to succeed, and I think there is a very real likelihood that he'll either have to reverse course, or that for one reason or another, ultimately have to resort to force, perhaps in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, perhaps in terms of dealing with the ethnic unrest inside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> `` And, of course, there's always the possibility that his successor may arrive fairly soon and may pursue radically different policies than he has,'' he said. In apparent reference to pressure from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for talks with the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> on reducing short-range nuclear weapons, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said, `` I think we're in a posture now where people are responding to what they perceive to be the intentions of the Soviet leadership rather than what are the capabilities of the Soviet military. `` And we do n't have the luxury of assuming that the intentions expressed by Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> necessarily are going to permanently become a part of the policies of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' he cautioned. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> must `` continue to resist the temptation to react to Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s ` proposal of the month' by trying to dismantle, if you will, some of our own military capabilities or alliance strength.'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>'s comments came as the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> accused the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> of trying to undermine <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s nuclear defense and instructed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassadors in Western capitals to counter the West German drive for negotiations. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> offensive is designed to rally the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> against any reduction in nuclear battlefield weapons before President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> meets with the 15 allied leaders in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> at the end of May. West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, trying to counter growing support for disarmament in his country, sent Defense Minister <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for talks to try to persuade the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration tn negotiate with the Soviets over the missiles. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said that `` having spent yesterday negotiating'' with <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> over the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> proposal and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s plans for modernizing short-range Lance missiles in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, he is convinced that `` now more than ever, the alliance requires strong leadership.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will provide an example, he said, by maintaining its current troop strength in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> _ about 350,000 _ despite budgetary pressures at home to bring some forces home. `` I would hope that eventually it will indeed be possible to take down some of those forces that are currently stationed over there and to restructure our military forces accordingly but I do n't believe the summer of l989 is the time to do it,'' he said.

 The federal agency overseeing the nation's futures markets on Tuesday recommended against increasing penalties for violating trading laws and called for more study on other suggested reforms The <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, in response to questions posed by Sen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., said it `` does not believe that proposals for treble damages and punitive damages would significantly enhance deterrence of violative conduct. <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, is exploring proposals to tighten regulation of futures markets in the wake of revelations that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has conducted a two-year undercover investigation of alleged abuses at the two largest futures exchanges, the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>'s panel, and its counterpart in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, have been conducting hearings into the matter and on whether or not <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should extend the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION>'s authorization to continue operating after Sept. 30. The commission did not recommend increased penalties but it recommended removing a requirement that it consider a firm or trader's financial condition before levying a penalty. The commission, chaired by <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, said the exchanges themselves should increase their surveillance programs, but noted that a number were already doing so. It said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should increase the agency's staff by 20 positions, but recommended against changing the rules to offer higher pay to attract more qualified professionals. Instead, the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> said pay should be raised across-the-board for professional positions in the federal government. It said it would support increasing the physical presence of <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> on exchange floors, but said it was reviewing its staff to determine if that could be done without hurting other efforts. In another area, the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> said it plans to monitor the composition of the boards that govern the exchanges to ensure that the public, in addition to floor traders, are adequately represented.

<HEAD>Weekly Publishes 8-Page Cover Story On Late Cardinal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A weekly published what was believed to be the first detailed report on the late Cardinal <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Mindszenty </PERSON> and his show trial for treason, incarceration and seclusion in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomatic mission. In its latest issue, Idea carried a front-page photo showing the cardinal praying in front of an altar. Idea was formerly the publication of the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, which is now defunct. It now refers to itself as `` a political weekly.'' Displaying a degree of press freedom unthinkable only months ago, Idea carried an eight-page report that included an account of <PERSON> Mindszenty </PERSON>'s trial. It also made frequent references to his memoirs and printed a speech <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s Roman Catholic prelate made on Nov. 3, 1956, a day before Soviet tanks quashed a popular uprising against Soviet rule. In the speech, the cardinal said the main aim of the Hungarians should be the `` revitalization of the nation'' and demanded `` an all-out effort of the entire country for progress.'' <PERSON> Mindszenty </PERSON> also said, `` <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s fate will be decided by what the Russian Empire decides to do. We did n't attack <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>, and we hope that Russian troops will be withdrawn from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>.'' However, it took almost 33 years for the Soviets to begin a withdrawal. A first batch of Soviet tanks were pulled out Tuesday, starting a partial pullout of 10,000 Red Army soldiers. <PERSON> Mindszenty </PERSON> was arrested in 1948 as an enemy of communism and, following a humiliating trial, was sentenced to life in prison on trumped-up charges of high treason. In 1956, he was freed from prison by Hungarian revolutionaries. After the Soviets crushed the uprising, <PERSON> Mindszenty </PERSON> found shelter in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mission in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> until 1971, when he left under an agreement worked out between the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. After a short stay in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mindszenty </PERSON> settled in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, where he died in 1975 at age 83. <PERSON> Konrad </PERSON> <PERSON> Szanto </PERSON>, a Franciscan and historian, was quoted by the magazine as saying there were increasing signs of a broad demand for the rehabilitation of <LOCATION> Mindszenty </LOCATION> along with others, who were imprisoned on similar phony charges. Last month, <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>, a Politburo member and leading party reformer, said <PERSON> Mindszenty </PERSON>'s trial would be reviewed as part of the re-examination of all political trials in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> between 1945 and 1962.

<HEAD>Gunmen Attack Turkish Diplomat's House in Iran</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANKARA, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 At least five gunmen fired repeatedly at a Turkish diplomat's house in the Iranian city of <LOCATION> Oroumieh </LOCATION> but inflicted no casualties, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> announced on Tuesday. It said the attack occurred Monday at the residence of <PERSON> Selami </PERSON> <PERSON> Demirbas </PERSON>, the administrative attache at the Turkish Consulate in <LOCATION> Oroumieh </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Demirbas </PERSON> and his wife were inside the house at the time. The Iranian charge d'affaires was summoned to the Foreign Ministry Tuesday, told of <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s concern and asked that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> guarantee the safety of Turkish diplomats in that country, the statement said. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials declined to speculate on the identities of the attackers in <LOCATION> Oroumieh </LOCATION> in northwestern <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> near the Turkish border. But a government source, speaking on condition he not be identified, said the attack might have been carried out by Armenians.

 South African soldiers and Namibian police began returning to their bases Tuesday to give black nationalist guerrillas free passage back across the border into <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> spokesmen said. The soldiers and the police counterinsurgency units of the South African-controlled territory, also known as <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, are to remain on base from Wednesday evening through Saturday morning. Since Monday night, radio stations, aircraft and police vehicles have been broadcasting recorded messages from the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, telling guerrillas in the northern Namibian bush that from 6 p.m. Wednesday, only <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> forces will be watching the border. The government-run South African <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said more than half of the 1,600 guerrillas who crossed into the territory April 1 have gone back. Only a dozen have appeared at U.N.-monitored assembly points and churches because of the proximity of South African military and South-West African police forces. A week and a half of fighting after the incursion cost more than 300 lives and endangered the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> independence plan intended to lead to elections in November, which <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> is favored to win. South African officials said Tuesday that the 60-hour safe passage period this week will be <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>'s last chance to get its fighters out of the territory and into U.N.-monitored bases in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, from where they will return, unarmed, to participate in the elections. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas have fought since 1966 to end <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 74-year rule over <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> officials have said their guerrillas were trying to go to U.N.-supervised bases in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> on April 1, when South African forces were already confined to base.

 A B-1B bomber made an emergency landing without incident Tuesday afternoon at <ORGANIZATION> Luke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> west of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> because of electrical problems on a training flight, officials said.

However, he said he did not know if the flight originated there. Built in 1941 to train fighter pilots, <PERSON> Luke </PERSON> is a <ORGANIZATION> Tactical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> base with no bomber squadrons. However, <PERSON> McKenzie </PERSON> said the B-1 had no problem setting down on one of two 10,000-foot-long runways about 12:50 p.m. He said officials did not know whether weapons were aboard, or what type they might be.

<TEXT>
 A key figure in two federal investigations involving <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> was convicted Tuesday of drug trafficking stemming from an undercover <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> operation. An eight-woman, four-man jury deliberated for 90 minutes before finding former <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> government consultant <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> guilty of all four drug counts against him. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> trial took two days. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, 48, was charged with two counts of drug possession and two counts of distribution in the sale of $ 550 worth of crack, a cocaine derivative, to undercover <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents last month. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said each count carries a maximum sentence of 20 years and $ 1 million. Chief U.S. District Court Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> set sentencing for June 14 and released <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> on unsecured bond of $ 10,000. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> left the courtroom accompanied by his brother and sister. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> had pleaded innocent but did not testify. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> faces 10 felony charges in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in a separate case in which <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> police reportedly were called off an attempted drug buy from <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> while <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> was visiting his hotel room in the city. A federal grand jury is looking into the circumstances of <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>'s visit to the hotel. A second investigation involving <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> focuses on the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>'s joint personnel project with the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> last year. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> headed the $ 266,000 project for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> territory until he was fired by Gov. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrelly </PERSON> in April 1988 because of cost overruns. In the current case, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> accused <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> of selling 0.12 ounces of crack worth $ 550 to two undercover agents March 2 and 3 at a luxury hotel on <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Thomas </LOCATION>, one of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. Special <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Krauss </PERSON>, who allegedly bought crack from <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> with agent <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, testified that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> believed <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> had been using and selling cocaine for a long time. `` The purpose of the undercover operation was to prove or disprove Mr. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>' association with drugs,'' she said. The agent said she and Ms. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> were introduced to Lewis March 2 by a <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Teal </PERSON>, identified in court only as a `` cooperating citizen,'' and bought two $ 25 bags of crack the same day. Ms. <PERSON> Krauss </PERSON> said arrangements were made to buy $ 500 worth of crack and a $ 15 pipe for smoking the drug to be delivered to a room at the Frenchmen's Reef Hotel. `` Our scenario was to suggest a party to <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>,'' the agent testified. Defense attorney <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> argued that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> used female agents to entice <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> into the illegal drug transaction. `` Was it coincidence that <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> that there were three people _ three ladies _ awaiting him to see if he can buy drugs?'' <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> asked the jury. Before closing arguments Tuesday, however, Judge <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> denied a defense motion to dismiss the case on ground of entrapment. Psychiatrist <PERSON> Olaf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendricks </PERSON>, testifying for the defense, said <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> told him he was a longtime abuser of alcohol and was psychologically addicted to crack. <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> told the jury that drug addiction could not be cited as a reason for acquittal.

 A judge Tuesday overturned the murder conviction of a former migrant farm worker in the poisoning deaths of his seven children, freeing the 53-year-old man after 21 years in prison. Retired Circuit Judge <PERSON> Clifton </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> released <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, 53, to the custody of defense attorney <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. The decision came after an extraordinary appeal in which both <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> and special prosecutor <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> agreed that <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, a black man who was convicted by an all-white jury, had been railroaded. `` Within my heart, I knew that these great men were going to get me out _ they were n't going to let me stay in there,'' the gray-haired <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, flanked by his attorneys, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` Right now, I feel fine.'' <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> was convicted in 1968 of murdering his oldest child, an 8-year-old daughter, and sentenced to death. His sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment. `` This court is now convinced that the defendant did not receive a fair trial,'' <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> told a packed courtroom in the <LOCATION> DeSoto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Courthouse </LOCATION>. `` There is a definite possibility of a different outcome in the trial'' if material that the defense should have had access to had been provided by the prosecution, he said. The judge denied defense attorney <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>'s motion to dismiss the charge, saying the state would decide later whether to retry the case. <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, however, said the charges would be dropped within about 10 days. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>'s attorneys said they were thrilled. `` We have shown the world there is justice in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mae </PERSON>, cried when she heard the judge's decision She raised her arms to the heavens and said, `` Thank you, thank you.'' Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, who had appointed <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> to review the case, said the evidence justified <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>'s release. `` Mr. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> has lost too many years of his life in prison, but my hope is that this decision will give him an opportunity to rebuild,'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION>, the capital. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> spent the day listening to arguments from three sides: <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>'s defense attorneys, the former prosecutor who brought the case in 1968, and the special prosecutor. He deliberated about 30 minutes before making his ruling. <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> had argued that the state attorney and the <LOCATION> DeSoto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff at the time of the trial railroaded <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> by manufacturing and encouraging perjured testimony and by withholding essential evidence from the defense. Now, the state and the defense `` both say the judgment of conviction must be vacated,'' said <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, lawyer and author who first alleged a frame-up in the case in his 1971 book `` <LOCATION> Arcadia </LOCATION>.'' Ms. <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, a state attorney from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, agreed with some of <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>'s conclusions that the prosecution and the sheriff had aided in violating the defendant's right to an impartial trial. She said former State Attorney <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaub </PERSON> and then-Assistant State Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Treadwell </PERSON> had withheld `` six key pieces of exculpatory evidence ... that could have changed the outcome.'' <PERSON> Schaub </PERSON>, who has said he remains convinced of the defendant's guilt, denied the use of perjured testimony or the withholding of key information He accused Ms. <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> of `` a hatchet job'' and said she and her staff had `` little respect for the truth'' in their zeal to free `` a child-killer.'' The ex-state attorney called himself the `` last remaining protector of the rights of these poor, young defenseless children.'' He is suing <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> for alleged defamation of character. Lane charged that <PERSON> Schaub </PERSON>, <PERSON> Treadwell </PERSON> and then-Sheriff <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Cline </PERSON> forced jail inmates and others to testify against <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> and suppressed evidence favorable to the defendant. <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said <PERSON> Cline </PERSON> was friendly to <PERSON> Bessie </PERSON> <PERSON> Reese </PERSON>, the babysitter who originally came under suspicion in the poisoning case, and lied to protect her. <PERSON> Cline </PERSON> was with Ms. <PERSON> Reese </PERSON> on the morning in 1967 when <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>' children were fed lunch laced with parathion, a since-banned deadly insecticide, <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Reese </PERSON>, who is in her late 60s and is immobile in a nursing home, has confessed to nurses to the deaths, according to an affidavit from nurses. No charges have been filed against her and prosecutors have said she has become confused. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, 71, was appointed from retirement by the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to hear the arguments. The case has drawn intense attention in the area and security was heavy at the courthouse.

 American TV evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said Tuesday that <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government is willing to stop accepting Soviet military aid and slash the size of its army under a regional peace plan. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said Vice President <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> also told him <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> would let neutral observers inspect its military installations and allow international monitors at the borders. `` I'm not an official of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government, nor do I speak for them,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> told a news conference. `` But it would appear to me as a private citizen that if the Nicaraguan government agrees to a comprehensive arms settlement, and if such a settlement is accompanied by truly valid verification procedures, such a proposal would be warmly received by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration.'' <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s presidential press office told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> it would seek verification from <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>'s office of what <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> told reporters. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said the embassy had no comment because <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> was on a private visit. Neither <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> issued statements when they met at <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>'s office Monday night. When <PERSON> Roberton </PERSON> sought the Republican presidential nomination last year, he strongly supported U.S.-backed rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, known as Contras. In 1985, he called the Contras an `` army of God.'' President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> left on a 10-nation European tour Saturday seeking financial help for <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, in an economic crisis with hyperinflation and declining production. Several European countries have said further aid depends on <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s efforts toward democratization and free and fair general elections next Feb. 25. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> on Tuesday addressed a session of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, and invited the parliamentarians to send observers to monitor <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s electoral process up to and including the February voting. He pledged fair and open elections and defended a new electoral law which his foes at home denounced as undemocratic. `` I extend a formal invitation to the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> to send a team of observers ... so they get to know the whole political situation in the country,'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said. However, a group of about 40 people, including opposition party members, gathered in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> on Tuesday to protest the government's electoral reforms <PERSON> Violeta </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>, publisher of the opposition daily <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION>, said the reforms violate accords that <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> made last February with other regional leaders. `` This is a first violation of those accords. This law is a fraud,'' she said. The opposition says the new law does not give it equal access to media outlets. It also says the reforms give the Sandinistas control of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> Monday for the resumption of a Spanish-language version of his evangelical TV show `` 700 Club,'' which last broadcast here in August 1979, a month after the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> rose to power. `` The principal reason of my visit is religious,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said. `` Nevertheless, in my meeting with the vice president, in answer to my questions he said, speaking for the government of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, that he was prepared to accept as part of a Central American peace initiative reductions in the Nicaraguan army to 25,000 men.'' Estimates of the size of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s armed forces run as high as 123,000 men. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> later said <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> gave no time frame for effecting these reductions. <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> also said <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> would accept `` international monitors of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s borders to ensure no traffic in arms or combatants in or out of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> or any other countries in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' according to <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has accused <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> of supplying arms to leftist guerrillas in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, separated by only 25 miles by the Gulf of <PERSON> Fonseca </PERSON>. `` The vice president indicated he would agree to international inspections by neutral observers of Nicaraguan military equipment and installations,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> added. `` He also indicated to me that as part of a Central American peace plan, the government would agree to complete cessation by <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> of accepting Soviet arms and equipment.'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> and the presidents of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> signed an accord last Feb. 14 that calls for electoral and other reforms in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.

 Guests sipped champagne and ate a candlelight dinner in the shadow of a huge trash heap Tuesday to celebrate the opening of a modern recycling center. About 300 people, including Gov. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON>, watched the first plastic and glass bottles and jugs travel up conveyor chutes to be crushed and granulated at the facility. The dusty, smelly hills of the Central Landfill, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s largest dump, loomed in the background. Some of the guests then munched hors d'oeuvres and sipped champagne at a tent nearby as the candlelight dinner was prepared in this <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION> suburb. `` This is the most automated recycling facility in the country,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Katz </PERSON>, a recycling manager for CRInc., the company running the plant The center also has the highest volume of any in the country, he said. `` We took recycling out of the sweatshop and put it into an efficient assembly-line environment,'' <PERSON> Katz </PERSON> said. The new plant employs eight sorters and 12 office staff, equipment operators and maintenance workers. The plant can process 140 tons of recyclables per eight-hour shift, while systems in other states process up to 60 tons a day with more than 20 employees, he said. The recycling plant will reduce the dump's garbage intake by 40,000 tons per year, <PERSON> Katz </PERSON> said. He stood near a display of soda and soup cans, a ketchup bottle and two tennis balls, all products of recycling. The fuzzy material on the outside of the tennis balls came from recycled plastic, <PERSON> Katz </PERSON> said. About a third of <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>'s communities are recycling, putting blue boxes filled with aluminum cans and plastic and glass bottles on their curbsides and leaving newspapers in paper bages. Mandatory recycling is to begin within a few years in the state. Such measures also are under consideration in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and other cities hard-pressed to dispose of their waste.

 <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Previn </PERSON> resigned Tuesday as music director of the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philharmonic </ORGANIZATION> amid reports of clashes with his boss, but will continue as a guest conductor for the next three seasons. `` In the current structure of the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Philharmonic </LOCATION>, it has become obvious to me there is no room for a music director,'' <PERSON> Previn </PERSON>, 60, told the board, according to a release from the philharmonic.

He said he planned to conduct the Philharmonic for seven weeks next season and six weeks each for the 1990-1991 and 1991-1992 seasons. <PERSON> Previn </PERSON> also will take up the baton for some recordings, a May 1990 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tour, and for the opening concert of the Carnegie Hall centennial season in September 1990. A message seeking comment was left for <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON>, but there was no immediate response. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Connell </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Philharmonic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors, said <PERSON> Previn </PERSON>'s resignation was accepted with regret <PERSON> Previn </PERSON>, an Academy Award-winning composer and conductor, stepped down as the <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION>'s music director to take the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> post, replacing <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Giulini </PERSON>. It was a triumphant return to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> for <PERSON> Previn </PERSON>, whose parents brought him to the city in 1939 after fleeing <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. He began his composing career at <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION> studios at age 16, and eventually wrote scores for more than 30 movies. He won Oscars for `` Gigi'' -LRB- 1958 -RRB-, `` Porgy and <PERSON> Bess </PERSON>,'' -LRB- 1959 -RRB-, `` <PERSON> Irma </PERSON> <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Douce </PERSON>,'' -LRB- 1963 -RRB- and `` My Fair Lady,'' -LRB- 1964 -RRB-.

 Several hundred friends, associates and diplomatic colleagues said goodbye Tuesday to <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> envoy <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> <PERSON> Parodi </PERSON>, who said the lack of `` a political will'' is blocking improved relations between his country and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. At a buffet reception given by <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> <PERSON> Parodi </PERSON> in the ornate old <ORGANIZATION> Cuban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> building on 16th Street, the departing envoy offered scant hope of warmer U.S.-Cuban relations under President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Asked about the prospects, he replied, `` That is for the administration to say, not for us.'' `` There is a need for a political will to improve relations,'' said <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> <PERSON> Parodi </PERSON>, who leaves Thursday to become Cuban's deputy foreign minister after nearly 12 years as <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s diplomatic representative in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He will be succeeded by <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbezu </PERSON>, vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cuban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> for <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> affairs, who is scheduled to arrive in May. Among those offering best wishes to <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> <PERSON> Parodi </PERSON> in his new post were Rep. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>; Mrs. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, wife of the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sargent </PERSON> <PERSON> Shriver </PERSON>, who also is chairman of Special Olympics International. <PERSON> Shriver </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate in 1972, said he thanked <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> <PERSON> Parodi </PERSON> for <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s participation in Special Olympics athletic games for the mentally retarded and handicapped for the past eight years. `` This gentleman has been very helpful in maintaining good working relations between the Special Olympics and the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> government,'' <PERSON> Shriver </PERSON> said. `` I'm just here to wish him well in his new job.'' Although <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> <PERSON> Parodi </PERSON> was invited to several White House social events during the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration after he opened a small Cuban diplomatic mission here in the summer of 1977, he was given the deep freeze during President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s eight years in office. No <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration official attended the Cuban mission's farewell party for <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> <PERSON> Parodi </PERSON>, who had been officially snubbed by the White House and the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> throughout the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration His last invitation to a White House social event was when he attended a reception for the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> diplomatic corps shortly after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took office in January 1981. <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> <PERSON> Parodi </PERSON> refused comment on a memorandum that Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> sent to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomatic posts last month in which he declared that improved relations with <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> were impossible until <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> stops fomenting subversion in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION> and supporting Soviet expansionism.

 Judges hoping to find an opening line to rise to the literary heights of ` It was a dark and stormy night ...' will approach their task fortified by soggy potato chips and cheap wine. Judging of the annual Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest is about to begin, and the poor souls faced with the brain-numbing task of poring over thousands of convoluted, clumsy or just plain bad entries need something else to turn their stomachs. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jose </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> English </ORGANIZATION> professor who started the contest eight years ago, calls it a `` literary sting operation to expose the world's wretchedest writers,'' to flash a `` spotlight on the seamy underside of literature.'' `` This year, we've gotten a lot of entries from places like <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> ... the people Down Under have taken a big interest in the contest,'' said <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> said he goes over the entries before the judging and tosses out anything too well written. After all, you've got to keep up -LRB- down? -RRB- the standards of a rotten writing contest, he said. Appropriately, judges will be energized by `` soggy potato chips and cheap wine.'' Results will be announced May 5. The contest is named for Lord <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Earle </PERSON> <PERSON> Bulwer-Lytton </PERSON>, who, with a leap of timeless turgidity, wafted to literary immortality with the opening, `` It was a dark and stormy night ...'' The central rule of the contest is to `` write the opening sentence to the worst possible hypothetical novel in any genre they choose,'' like this entry from <LOCATION> Conroe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>: `` Like an over-ripe beefsteak tomato rimmed with cottage cheese, the corpulent remains of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> lay dead on the hotel floor.'' Or, from, <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>: `` <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> liked his women the way he liked his kiwi fruit: sweet yet tart, firm-fleshed yet yielding to the touch, and covered with short, brown, fuzzy hair.'' If those deliciously rotten examples fail to bring a tear, maybe this slippery gem from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, will do the job: `` Her mouth said, ` No-no-no,' but every other inch of her throbbing, glistening body said ` yes-yes-yes,' except for her pancreas ...'' The first competition in the unlikely contest drew only six entries, to a high point of 20,000 entries from around the globe three years ago. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> said he created the contest to provoke <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jose </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> students to approach writing playfully and with a sense of whimsy. A campus literary organization is named the Bulwer-Lytton Undergraduate Society. `` We try to promote the philosophy that people should approach the language recreationally as well as practically,'' the professor said.

 The creator of a large photograph of a crucified Christ submerged in urine said Tuesday his critics were flattering the work by creating a furor over it. An organization in <LOCATION> Tupelo </LOCATION> has condemned the federal and private funding of the artist and an exhibit of his work, saying it reflected bigotry against Christians. The creator of `` Piss Christ'' was a winner in The Awards in the Visual Arts funded by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Equitable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said Monday that tax dollars should not have gone toward the $ 15,000 award for the artist, <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON>. His was one of 10 such awards last year. `` The person at the National Endowment for the Arts responsible for approving federal tax dollars for promotion of the ` work of art' should be fired,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wildmon </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> minister who heads the Tupelo-based association. <PERSON> Wildmon </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Equitable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a section of <ORGANIZATION> Equitable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> `` owe Christians a public apology and assurance that they will not be a party to such anti-Christian bigotry in the future.'' <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON> said Tuesday from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that he expected some opposition to his work, primarily because of the title. `` I feel when people attack a work of art to such a great extent, they imbue it with a far greater power than when they ignore it and, in that, I'm flattered that they think it deserves such attention.'' As winner of the stipend, the artist selects a work for a national tour. The 38-year-old <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> artist said `` Piss Christ,'' the piece he selected for tour, was a limited edition of four prints. One print, he said, already has been sold to a private collector for $ 3,600. The work is not currently on exhibit. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Slye </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, defended the award. `` Expression not prohibited by federal law is protected by the First Amendment,'' he said. `` Moreover, the endowment is expressly forbidden in its authorizing legislation from interfering with the artistic choices made by its grantees. `` The national Endowment for the Arts supports the right of grantee organizations to select, on artistic criteria, their artist-recipients and present their work, even though sometimes the work may be deemed controversial and offensive to some individuals,'' <PERSON> Slye </PERSON> said. `` We at the endowment do, none the less, deeply regret any offense to any individual.'' <PERSON> Stefan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stux </PERSON>, owner of the Stux gallery in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> which handles <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON>'s works, said the photograph was created by immersing an image of the crucified Christ in a glass container of `` urine he had collected from himself.'' `` When you look at it, you would never know that, all you can see is the image of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> in a kind of hazy, yellowish mist, a kind of poetical image. If you did not know the title of it, you could be very enraptured by the beauty of it. It is very pleasing, poetic and spiritual.'' He said the artist uses other body fluids in his art, including blood. `` He was born in the Christian faith, he feels very much a part of that,'' <PERSON> Stux </PERSON> said. `` He has deep religious feelings, but he does not express them exactly the way every other guy does.'' <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldmark </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>: `` I respect the right of any individual to object to a work of art, and the parallel right of artists to express themselves and of exhibitors to show works that they deem interesting and meritorious artistically. I think tolerance and mutual respect for such rights may be the qualities we most need in order to get along together on this planet.''

<HEAD>Atlanta-Area Lending Practices Reported Under Investigation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A number of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> banks and thrift institutions said Tuesday they would cooperate with a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigation of possible racial discrimination in the area's mortgage lending industry `` I'm sure the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will find a good level of cooperation among <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s financial institutions,'' said <PERSON> Dallas </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, a spokesman for Citizens and <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday that the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> wants to see loan records covering the past five years as part of an investigation of the 64 banks and savings and loan associations in the metropolitan <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> area. The newspaper said the agency's Civil Rights Division, in letters that began arriving Monday, gave the institutions official notice that they are under civil investigation. The letters, signed by Acting Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, asked the institutions to make the records available voluntarily, it said. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and others said the banks have taken significant steps in the past year to do away with discrimination in mortgage lending. `` We are surprised that <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> was the city the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> picked for its investigation, considering all the activities that have taken place in the last year,'' said <PERSON> Bo </PERSON> <PERSON> Spalding </PERSON>, director of communications for <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION>. `` I would n't be surprised if, after all of this, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> has a rather exemplary record of minority lending. `` We do n't feel we have discriminated overtly,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Fulton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. `` I do n't think there is a single instance of outright discrimination by any of the larger institutions.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said the case is the broadest inquiry into so-called redlining since the government settled a suit against the national real estate appraisal associations in the late 1970s. Redlining, which is prohibited by federal law, is the refusal to lend on the basis of race or other factors unrelated to credit worthiness. The investigation was prompted by articles beginning last May in The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Constitution that disclosed a segregated mortgage system in which banks and thrifts made few loans in black areas _ even in upper-income black areas _ and often made mortgage services less accessible to black home buyers. <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s largest banks responded to the articles by pooling $ 77 million for low-interest mortgages primarily in black neighborhoods. A few of the largest banks also changed some policies, such as increasing contacts with black real estate agents. Many smaller institutions reported no changes. The Justice inquiry, going beyond information available to the newspaper, seeks records of actual loan applications and credit reports on mortgage applicants, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> barnstormed <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on Tuesday, sending a message to drug dealers that `` you are going to be out of business'' and asking the entertainment industry to raise its voice against illegal narcotics. `` I never want to see a movie again that makes drug use into something humorous,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` It is time that they got behind this crusade.'' He also campaigned for smaller budget deficits and lower taxes on capital gains. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> blended a variety of sharply different themes in a three-stop series of appearances in northern and southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on the second day of a busy four-day trip through six states. The journey took him from a <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> plant in <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION> to a remote ranch in <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> seized from an alleged drug kingpin and finally to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> for an appearance before a Hispanic audience. Opening the day, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> started to say he was in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> but quickly caught himself and corrected it to north <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Later, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> toured the 213-acre <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>, described by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> as once housing the largest marijuana network in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Now it is used by <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> as a training facility for drug enforcement officers. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not propose any new federal initiatives but called on the entertainment industry to use its influence as a tool against drugs. He said entertainers `` have raised your voices so effectively in the cause of so many issues. Can you not raise them once more, in support of a cause so important?'' He turned over to law enforcement officials $ 10 million recovered from drug dealers. He called the money `` the bounty of defeated drug criminals'' and said `` let these funds go to fighting the war they once financed. ... `` And let us send a message, loud and clear to every drug merchant in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> _ you are going to be out of business.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` We wo n't build a better <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> until we win the war on drugs.'' He said drug users were living lives without hope or meaning. `` We're looking at a desperation that money alone will never cure. We wo n't win this one with our wallets alone _ we will win it through our collective effort and our collective will.'' In <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met with Republican Hispanic supporters. He said Hispanics were building a better <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> `` through family, church, love of country and belief in the value of hard work.'' He said: `` As <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s fastest-growing minority in the 21st century, you, more than ever, will help tell the American story.''

 After the Hispanic reception in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> flew by helicopter to <LOCATION> Anaheim </LOCATION> to watch a baseball game between the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION>. He was to remain in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> overnight and meet Wednesday with former president <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. At his first stop of the day, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the best investment for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s future would be to cut the huge federal budget deficit, warning that `` tough talks still lie ahead'' to achieve that goal. He said the nation must be more competitive to sustain the economic recovery that has produced nearly 20 million jobs over the last seven years. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke to workers at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION>'s space systems division in <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION>. The facility, which employs 2,000 people, produces communications satellites, tactical weapons systems, space systems and other high-tech products. After touring the aerospace facility, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the audience that `` the best investment in the future is to slash the federal deficit. Every dollar the government does not borrow means more capital available for investment.'' He noted that he recently concluded a sketchy agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to cut the deficit to $ 99.4 billion in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. The blueprint does not provide much detail about how the reduction will be achieved. `` Now this plan's an agreed outline,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` Tough talks still lie ahead.'' He said: `` Think of deficit reduction as an exercise, like walking the dog every day. Believe me, I know, exercise keeps you at the top of your game.'' While challenging the nation to become more competitive in technological innovation, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not offer any new initiatives. He made a new pitch to reduce the capital gains tax rate to 15 percent from its current level of 28 percent. `` Lower capital gains taxes will create jobs for those who do n't have jobs and help build a better <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' He laced his speech with television sound-bite lines such as `` I want to give the high-five symbol to high tech. And I want to do it by investing in competitiveness.'' Ticking off some of his proposals, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> noted he has proposed a permanent extension of tax credits for research and experimentation, and has asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for an increase of $ 2.4 billion for <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>. `` Let us use our own technological prowess to expand free and fair trade,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I'm talking about excellence in such fields as microcomputers, superconductivity and, yes, aerospace.'' Before an audience of white-collar workers, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also extolled his proposal for a child-care tax credit for low-income parents. His plan would provide a credit of up to $ 1,000 for each child under age 4 in poor families. `` Our proposal urges a nex tax credit to make child care more affordable,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` And it puts money in the hands of the low-income parents, limits federal intervention and increases options. `` A church can help or grandparents or professional nursery,'' he said. `` When it comes to child care, we say, let the parents decide. Keep the family strong and we must do that.''

 At the drug store straddling the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania-Ohio </LOCATION> line, the big money Tuesday moved to <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> McGhee </PERSON>'s lottery machine in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and ignored <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Trinckes </PERSON>' machine in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. The difference was a fortune. The Super 7 jackpot soared to $ 100 million in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and its upper reaches were limited only by the deadline for the drawing Wednesday night. Miss Trinckes sold a few tickets for the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lottery </ORGANIZATION>'s Super Lotto game, worth a mere $ 3 million. But even she crossed the line to plunk down $ 20 for 20 tickets in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. `` I do n't even play their lottery,'' she said, `` but since it's so high, I decided to. Lottery fever heightened not just in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> but around the country as state officials upped the ante in the Super 7 Lottery drawing to at least $ 100 million based on ever-speeding ticket sales from the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> to the Penn-Ohio Drug store off <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 62. The jackpot is the result of six straight weekly drawings with no winner and international publicity, which generated ticket sales Monday of $ 19 million and a state record for daily sales of $ 24.34 million Tuesday. Last week's jackpot was $ 46 million. A single winner of the $ 100 million would receive almost $ 3.85 million a year for 26 years, lottery officials said. <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s Super 7 game lets players choose seven numbers from 1 to 80 for $ 1. If those seven are among 11 numbers selected, the combination wins the jackpot, a chance lottery officials put at 9.6 million to 1. Out-of-state players drove to <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, and many even flew commercial flights into <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> to get a chance for the biggest-ever jackpot in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The line outside the two-state store, northeast of <LOCATION> Youngstown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, grew to 150 people at times, sometimes stretching all the way across the state line, as patrons waited for the store's two <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> lottery machines to crank out up 2,000 tickets per hour together. Store Senior Vice President <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Annis </PERSON> suggested to customers at the end of the line that they may have more luck _ at least buying tickets _ in nearby <LOCATION> Mercer </LOCATION>, about 20 miles into <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. `` We want your business, but we're running at capacity. Come back tomorrow,'' he said. Most Ohioans were not deterred. `` You can tell everybody that the winning ticket is going to <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, 36. `` I've been a police officer for 12 years and if I win, I'm going to retire.'' <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON>, 52, of <LOCATION> Ravenna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, admitted he may be foolish to take the longest of long shots, but said, `` What else are you going to do, not play?'' Miss <PERSON> McGhee </PERSON>, 40, of <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, said selling the tickets was not as hectic as it appeared. She noted clerks get a chance to rest when the machine prints tickets for large orders of 20 or more. She was able to rest Tuesday morning when one player ordered 200 tickets. And on Monday, one player bought 672 tickets. Co-workers still talked about a man who put up $ 1,400 for tickets last Thursday and gave them a 52-minute break. Miss <PERSON> McGhee </PERSON> said she only bought five tickets herself. Miss Trinckes, 31, of <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, complained of boredom because she sold only 168 <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> lottery tickets Tuesday morning. `` Normally, by this time, we would have sold 400 or 500.''

 Radio messages recorded the morning the Exxon Valdez hit a reef show the ship's captain spent up to an hour trying to rock the tanker free, which could have sunk the ship and spilled more oil, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. The captain ignored <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> warnings that trying to move the ship could have spilled the entire 1.2 million-barrel cargo, making the nation's worst oil spill almost five times as bad, the recordings show. But the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> commander who began monitoring the spill shortly after it began said he did not fault the tanker skipper's desperate efforts, and said he doubted they caused much more damage than already had occurred `` I think he probably used all his mariner's skills,'' after the grounding, said Cmdr. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> McCall </PERSON>. `` Obviously, before the grounding, he did n't do all he could to prevent it, because it happened.'' The state revised the estimate of the oil spilled from the tanker's punctured tanks to 11.2 million gallons. Officials said its crews had been busy with the cleanup and were slow revising <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s original estimate of 10.1 million gallons. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> said it has been hit with 31 lawsuits and 1,300 claims ranging from $ 500 to $ 4 million in connection with the spill, and expects more lawsuits as well as government fines. At a meeting of securities analysts, top <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> executives of the company said the company already had paid $ 400,000 to settle smaller claims. Environmental damage from the oil still is being assessed, but three hatcheries in oil-soaked Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> have begun releasing millions of tiny salmon because the annual bloom of plankton, an important food source for the fry, was at its peak. `` You ca n't stop Mother Nature,'' said <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarty </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the non-profit association that owns the three hatcheries. By mid-May, 800 million salmon fry will be released from five hatcheries throughout the sound. `` If we do n't release them now or within the next few days they'll miss the peak for plankton flowering. Then they wo n't survive for sure,'' she said Salmon fry tend to swim close to the surface of the water and remain close to shorelines until they migrate to the open sea, <PERSON> McCarty </PERSON> said. Exxon estimates at least 1 million gallons of oil still is floating on the water of the sound and the Gulf of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, and the fry may encounter oil. Oil-skimming operations were hampered by a third straight day of rough seas. Most vessels remained anchored in safe harbors, and snow fell in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the consortium of oil companies that operates the pipeline and marine terminal, announced it had purchased three emergency response vessels and would use them starting May 15 to help tugs escort tankers from <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> through Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> to the Gulf of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. The Exxon Valdez was not guided by tugs when it ran aground March 24. The recorded radio messages showed that <PERSON> McCall </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, warned Capt. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> to take it `` slow and easy'' in trying to get the ship off the reef that ripped his hull. `` Before you make any drastic attempt to get away, make sure you do n't, you know, start doing any ripping,'' <PERSON> McCall </PERSON> said. `` You got a rising tide ... I would n't recommend doing much wiggling.'' But <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> already had begun trying to free the tanker. `` A little problem here with the third mate, but we're working our way off the reef,'' <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> said. `` We've, ah, the vessel has been holed and we're ascertaining right now, we're trying to get her off the reef and we'll get back to you as soon as we can.'' The third mate was <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Cousins </PERSON>, whom <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> says had been given control of the ship as it maneuvered through Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> on its way to the Gulf of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and on to <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. Cousins, who was not certified to control the ship in the sound, has been unavailable for comment The reef was well outside the shipping lane through the sound. The first word of the accident came at 12:27 a.m. <ORGANIZATION> AST </ORGANIZATION> when <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> informed the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> that he was aground, `` leaking some oil and we're going to be here for awhile.'' The ship's logs indicate the ship ran aground 23 minutes earlier. <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> is charged with operating the vessel while intoxicated, reckless endangerment and negligent discharge of pollution into the water, all misdemeanors. His attorney, <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Madson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> will return to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> voluntarily, perhaps as early as next week and definitely before a May 5 extradition hearing in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The radio tapes were obtained in a Freedom of Information Act request filed by the <ORGANIZATION> Anchorage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, which published details of the conversations in a copyright story in its Tuesday editions. <PERSON> McCall </PERSON> said he doubted trying to free the ship exacerbated the problem to any significant degree. The ship's hull had at least eight holes, some up to 24 feet in diameter. Chief Petty Officer <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Wehn </PERSON> said typically the risk of rocking a stuck ship is that it may enlarge any holes in the bottom of the boat. `` Knowing what we know now, I believe it would have gone down'' <PERSON> McCall </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawn </PERSON> of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> said the tanker was shifting, creaking and groaning when he boarded it about three hours after it ran aground.

 Finance Minister <PERSON> Tatsuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Murayama </PERSON> said Tuesday that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s policy of coordinating economic and currency matters with its Western partners will not change with the resignation of Prime Minister <PERSON> Noburu </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>. `` It's not something that depends on one leader,'' <PERSON> Murayama </PERSON> told reporters. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s announcement Tuesday that he would resign came at a delicate time in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s international affairs. The announcement was followed by official reassurances that foreign and economic policies would remain steady. But the nation is expected to endure weeks of political uncertainty as a successor is found, leaving <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> a lame-duck leader. The prime minister said he would step down after parliament passes the fiscal 1989 budget. But parliament is stalled by an opposition boycott over the scandal enveloping the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and no legislative timetable exists for the leadership transition. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> will meanwhile be approaching crucial decisions on how to deal with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s huge trade surplus. Other countries may have to wait for word on Japanese aid and future moves on increasing cooperation in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> region. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, traveling with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said: `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is a close ally and friend. We will continue to work closely with the new prime minister and government.'' With a long holiday period called `` Golden Week'' starting Saturday, a number of Cabinet members were scheduled to make trips to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and other countries. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> will decide next month whether to impose sanctions against <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> under the new trade law because of the huge <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> deficit in trade with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, and several ministers were to leave Sunday for talks in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to try to avoid penalties. Among them were <PERSON> Hiroshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitsuzuka </PERSON>, minister for international trade and industry, and Agriculture Minister <PERSON> Tsutomu </PERSON> <PERSON> Hata </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mitsuzuka </PERSON> told reporters he expected to go ahead with his trip unless prevented by parliamentary business. `` The passage of the budget for the new fiscal year should be given top priority,'' he said. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said he would go ahead with a nine-day trip to five Southeast Asian countries starting Saturday `` because of the need for consistency and continuity in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s foreign policy.'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> remained set to visit <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for talks on a peace treaty and then go on to <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have yet to close the books on World War II. Analysts were divided on whether the widespread political scandal that prompted <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s resignation had an international impact. <PERSON> Yozo </PERSON> <PERSON> Yokoda </PERSON>, professor of international law at <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said bureaucrats here carry out policy, and switching prime ministers would have little effect on the government's ability to function. But he said foreign countries would be watching how <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> deals with the scandal, in which the <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> conglomerate is suspected of using bribes and dubious share transactions to buy influence with politicians and bureaucrats. `` Scandals are common in any democracy,'' <PERSON> Yokoda </PERSON> said. `` What's more important is how to overcome the scandal It will show the level of the country's democracy. If one dirty politician leaves only to be replaced by another dirty one, the Japanese political system will lose the trust of other countries.'' Foreign Secretary <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> said in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s talks there would center on <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s role in a multinational program to supply $ 10 billion in aid to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Omar </PERSON>, said the resignation `` is a shock, but we respect his position.'' He noted that <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> launched a development fund to benefit the six members of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and he hoped such aid would continue. <ORGANIZATION> ASEAN </ORGANIZATION> members are <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> is to visit all except <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Suharto </PERSON> will receive <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> with full honors in <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, State Secretary <PERSON> Moerdiono </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION>. He said <PERSON> Suharto </PERSON> described the visit as an indication of the close relationship between <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s aid to <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> is about $ 3 billion a year. South Korean President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>'s scheduled May 24-27 visit to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, already postponed from last November because of the fatal illness of Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, may be put off again, government sources in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> said Tuesday. `` The Japanese situation may take a long time to calm down, so it may be practically impossible for Mr. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> to make a trip this year,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> source there, speaking on condition of anonymity.

 A 16-year-old Vietnamese girl made deaf by a nerve ailment realized a dream Tuesday when she got to see her parents again before the disease takes her eyesight as well. <PERSON> Thao </PERSON> <PERSON> Phan </PERSON>, who last saw her parents nine years ago when her father smuggled her aboard a boat heading for <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, hugged her mother and father as they arrived in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> on a flight from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Thao </PERSON> and other family members applauded and wiped away tears. `` I have never been so tired,'' <PERSON> Geri </PERSON> <PERSON> Konigsberg </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> woman who helped reunite <PERSON> Thao </PERSON> with her family, said after making the 24-hour flight with the girl's parents. Ms. <PERSON> Konigsberg </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> who took an interest in <PERSON> Thao </PERSON>'s plight two years ago after she was contacted by school officials two years ago to see if the utility could arrange for clothing donations for the girl. `` I asked her what else she wanted. And she said she wanted her mother,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Konigsberg </PERSON>, who worked to grant <PERSON> Thao </PERSON>'s wish. <PERSON> Thao </PERSON> journeyed to <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> in the false bottom of a boat, then spent two years in a refugee camp before coming to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to live with a brother, one of two who arrived in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> in 1980. <PERSON> Thao </PERSON> suffers from Usher's Syndrome, a congenital nerve disease that took away her hearing and soon will leave her blind. She now has a sight range of only 15 inches and has no peripheral vision. Ms. <PERSON> Konigsberg </PERSON> said <PERSON> Thao </PERSON>'s father took the extreme measure with his daughter because handicapped people in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> are considered worthless. `` He did it out of love,'' she said, saying he hoped <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> doctors could help. <PERSON> Thao </PERSON> should lead a healthy life, although she is deaf and her loss of sight will eventually be complete, Ms. <PERSON> Konigsberg </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Thao </PERSON> speaks English in sign language. Her father, <PERSON> Lac </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Phan </PERSON>, 58, and mother, <PERSON> Mo </PERSON> <PERSON> Thi </PERSON> <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON>, 55, speak only Vietnamese, as do a sister, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION>, 17, and two brothers, <PERSON> Sohn </PERSON>, 10 and <PERSON> Ngoc </PERSON>, 7.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced plans Tuesday to nominate <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, a black critic of racial hiring quotas, to become the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s civil rights chief despite opposition from the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>. Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, in a statement released by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, called <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> `` a talented, decent and compassionate person whom I have known for a number of years.'' `` <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> is fully committed to the vigorous and fair enforcement of our country's civil rights laws and to removing barriers to equal opportunity for all our citizens,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. Questioned by reporters as he accompanied <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on a tour of a seized drug ranch in <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said that `` it's regrettable that this kind of fission has developed but the president and I are both strongly'' in favor of the nomination. `` There is bipartisan support for his nomination generally. Most of the senators we have talked to have agreed to withhold any position until they have an opportunity to talk to <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> and learn what we have learned. He's a man well-qualified to be on the job,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> added. The White House said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would nominate <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, 61, a <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> lawyer, to be assistant attorney general for civil rights. <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, a former Democrat, lost a race for governor of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> in 1986 after he joined the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. While opponents of the choice appeared to be gearing up for what could be a bruising fight for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation, Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., a leading member of the <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> that he would `` withhold judgment'' on <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> pending hearings `` We'll have a chance to examine his record,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said, noting reservations expressed by civil rights groups. <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> has said he generally opposes racial hiring quotas but once told an interviewer that there were `` some specific areas where quotas are appropriate.'' <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> has said he disagreed with attempts by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to overturn affirmative-action plans for the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> police department and the <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, fire department. Since <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> recommended <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> in February, <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> has drawn criticism from some civil rights leaders who question whether he is qualified to be the government's chief civil rights enforcer. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Neas </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, an umbrella coalition of 180 organizations, said his group is concerned that <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> lacks civil rights and legal experience. The group's executive committee has not taken a position on <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>. <PERSON> Neas </PERSON> said it would meet shortly to discuss whether to take one. `` <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> is a disappointing choice for the most important civil rights job in the federal government, a job for which expertise and experience are absolutely vital,'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kropp </PERSON>, president of People for the American Way. `` Instead of a strong civil rights advocate, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has chosen a man whose qualifications and record are at best a question mark,'' he added in a statement. People for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Way </ORGANIZATION>, a well-financed liberal organization, helped spearhead the 1987 fight to have the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> reject President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s nomination of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> for the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. On Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's oldest and largest civil rights group, announced its opposition, saying `` we do not believe Mr. <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> is the person for this post.'' But opposition to <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> is not universal among black civil rights leaders. The Rev. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, praised <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> in a letter to <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>. Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>, a black Democrat from <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, reiterated his support on Tuesday, saying a fight by civil rights groups to block <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation `` would be a useless one, maybe even counterproductive.'' `` As far as I can see this is as good a nomination as we are going to get,'' <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON> said, adding that, if <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> is defeated, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s next choice would also disappoint civil rights groups. `` My suspicions are that he wo n't pick anybody better and he wo n't pick another African-American,'' <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON> said. `` We'll end up regretting this hypercritical examination that some people choose to indulge in with reference to <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>.'' Opponents have pointed to <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>' record as sheriff of <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, which includes <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, as evidence he lacks the qualifications and sensitivity to run the civil rights division. They cite a 1976 court decision in which he was held in contempt of court for failure to reduce overcrowding in the <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> has contended his hands were tied by the refusal of local authorities to appropriate more money but the court also cited him for failure to improve conditions it said were within his control. In 1985, a federal appellate court, in a case involving allegations a prisoner was severely beaten while in custody, criticized <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, saying he failed to implement training procedures that would have prevented the incident. <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, who also served as <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> executive, has been criticized for listing himself as an assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on resumes he prepared in the 1970s. <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> served as a researcher in the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s civil rights division in the early 1960s but resigned in 1963 after he failed to pass the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> bar examination. The Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> sounded a conciliatory note. After an appearance Tuesday night at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, `` We would be better served by meeting with him than confronting him.'' `` I hope he serves well,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who said a major challenge for <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> would be interpreting the so-called `` <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> decision'' by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in January that struck down the city's minority contract quota system. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> urged <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> not to attempt to broaden the applications of the decision to other cities. While <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he would oppose an all-out <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation fight, he said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> should judge <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> `` by an objective set of criteria,'' and if he fails the test, he should be rejected.

<TEXT>
 An aide to <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> killed himself Wednesday after the prime minister announced he would resign partly because of financial dealings handled by the aide, police said. <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Ihei </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON> committed suicide by slashing his wrists with a razor and hanging himself at his home in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> on Wednesday morning. The network quoted police and fire officials as saying an ambulance crew, responding to an emergency call, found him dead. Officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> headquarters confirmed that <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON>, 58, had slashed his wrists. <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON> had handled political donations, stock purchases and loans from the <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which is at the hub of the bribery scandal that toppled <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>. There was no immediate comment on the suicide from <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, whom <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON> had served as aide for three decades. Two days before <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> announced his resignation, news reports surfaced that <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON> had accepted a loan from the <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of $ 384,000 in 1987 for use in <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s campaign to succeed <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> as prime minister. The money was later paid back. The revelation embarrassed <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> because he had not included it in a report to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on April 11, when he acknowledged receiving more than $ 1 million in legal political donations from Recruit, an information conglomerate. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> did not blame <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON> in his resignation statement, but news reports Monday said he had not known of the loan when he spoke to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. The reports said the aide had not informed him of it until Saturday. Recruit is accused of seeking influence and favors by selling shares in a subsidiary at bargain prices to politicians, bureaucrats, business leaders and media executives. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, through <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON> and a relative, received some of those shares, which skyrocketed in value after they went on public sale in late 1986. <PERSON> Aoki </PERSON> bought 2,000 shares, which yielded a profit of about $ 30,000. The scandal has forced the resignations of three Cabinet ministers in addition to <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> and led to the arrests of 14 businessmen and bureaucrats.

 Linked to a spreading influence-peddling scandal and immensely unpopular, Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> announced his resignation today but left the timing of his departure and the succession unclear. The Recruit scandal, which has bedeviled Japanese politics for half of <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s 18-month tenure, leaves <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in a state of political uncertainty and it appeared possible that an elder politician might become a sort of interim prime minister until the situation is sorted out.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Three years after <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> starred in an award-winning television special about schizophrenia, the actors have reunited for a production that can best be described as sobering. `` My Name Is Bill W.,'' which airs Sunday on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>, tells the story of <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, the late co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous. `` This is a very unsentimental version of <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s life,'' said <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>, 42, who plays <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. `` There are scenes in this picture that I think are literally hair-raising. There was no sentimental restraint placed on us. `` They allowed us to show the true story ... and it's a devastating story and it's not an easy story to watch,'' he added. The story focuses on the struggles of a stockbroker whose health and success are destroyed by twin calamities _ the stock market crash of 1929 and his own alcoholism. It details the days when <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> was unable to stop drinking despite the efforts of a devoted wife, <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> -LRB- played by <PERSON> JoBeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> -RRB-. Strapped to a hospital bed, he realizes he is helpless to defeat alcoholism alone. Most of the two-hour movie shows the horrors <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> faced before he met Dr. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, surgeon and drunk played by <PERSON> Garner </PERSON>. A church arranged for the two men to meet after <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, only sober for a short time and struggling to rebuild his life, arrived in <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION>. He was lonely, uptight and tempted by other drinkers. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, thinking <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> came to lecture him to stop drinking, was suspicious. `` Just what do you think a man like you can do for me?'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> asks. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> cries out: `` I did n't come here to help you. I came here to help me.'' <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> calls <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> `` two of the greatest men of this century, two drunks who got together to help each other and ended up helping millions of others.'' Filmed in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, the Hallmark Hall of Fame presentation was written by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Borchert </PERSON>, who read his script to the 97-year-old Mrs. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> on the back porch of her <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, home last fall. `` When I got finished she reached for my hand, put her arms around me and we shed tears together. She said, ` I'm very happy this story will finally be told to the world.' Twenty one days later she passed away,'' he said. The production was the idea of <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Duchow </PERSON>, co-producer with <PERSON> Garner </PERSON>. <PERSON> Duchow </PERSON> met <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> in the 1950s and was convinced by 1953 the story should be told. But he could not pursue it for 30 years. <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Duchow </PERSON> discussed the project in 1983 but five scripts were rejected. `` Because there is a tendency to beatify <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, most writers really are influenced by the size of the membership and what all of that means,'' he said. `` Our feeling was always let's personalize by simply telling the story of <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, which was very difficult to get on paper. <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> had worked together more than once. As a fledgling actor, <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> played the villain in the first episode of <PERSON> Garner </PERSON>'s `` The Rockford Files.'' And in `` Promise,'' another Hallmark special broadcast in 1986, <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> played a carefree man forced to care for his schizophrenic brother, played by <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>, after the death of their mother. It lost in the ratings to a <PERSON> Dolly </PERSON> <PERSON> Parton </PERSON> television movie, but won five Emmy awards. <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> recalled hearing Duchow and <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> `` mumbling about their next project'' in a coffee shop at the end of filming for `` Promise.'' `` I kind of cocked an ear and thought there could be a job in this. I said, ` Heh. I'm Bill W. I could be <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON>' I did n't quite realize what I was about to embark on,'' he said. `` I have friends and people I love very dearly who in the course of work are alcoholics. Most of them have found Alcoholics Anonymous and a few have not and some are dead,'' he said. `` I just hope the few who are n't members will find their way in.'' Even before the production aired, it had an impact. After <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> appeared on television talk shows to promote the movie, <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> was stopped by a woman outside his hotel in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>; she said the actors had convinced her brother to join AA. A day earlier, <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> had told a luncheon gathering, `` If we can save one life, then we will go greatly beyond what we hoped to do, which was great entertainment, some information. If there's a life or two along the way that we can save, then we will indeed be blessed.''

<HEAD>Corporate Dividends Are Rising</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Whatever <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> does, it's bound to attract attention and provoke discussion, and maybe even spur others to do the same. Investors who depend on dividends are hoping so. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> raised its common stock dividend this week for the first time in 4 -LCB- years. The 11-cent increase to $ 1.21 a share raises the annual yield to 4.2 percent from 3.9 percent and enriches shareholders by $ 250 million a year. Will others follow? Perhaps. But in this instance <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> is n't so much a leader as a follower. Without the excitement that often attends increases in share prices, corporate dividends have been moving higher for the past year. In fact, <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and independent analysts' data show it has been many months, even years, since such increases have been seen. There are suggestions that improvements will continue through the year. <ORGANIZATION> Wright </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which analyzes stock performance, notes that for the 12 months through March dividends for the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poors </ORGANIZATION> 500 stock index rose 11.5 percent. First-quarter action in the current year also was strong, according to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, with 521 companies raising dividends and 116 paying extras, `` the highest total of favorable dividend actions of any first quarter since 1982.'' If you use the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks as a measuring stick, the dividend news is even more impressive _ 26 percent for the first quarter, 17 percent for the past 12 months _ until you know the reason why. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> points out that these growth rates were inflated by two unusual actions, one being a $ 1.12 a share extra dividend by <ORGANIZATION> Alcoa </ORGANIZATION>, the other a 75 cents a share dividend paid by <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>, which was undergoing bankruptcy court reorganization a year earlier. <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> data verify the improved performance, indicating that recent dividend growth has been in the range of 10 percent to 12 percent. All in all, the activity has been the best since 1979-1980, but with a difference. That difference is a big one. In the earlier period the inflation rate was close to 10 percent and dividend growth was merely keeping pace. Inflation is lower today. Real dividend growth is more than 5 percent, highest in 12 years. Despite the sharp increases, the growth of dividends over the past year has trailed corporate profit growth, and dividend yields _ the payout compared to earnings _ remain well below the long-term norms. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> points out, for instance, that the 11 percent dividend increase for the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P 500 in the past 12 months compares with a profit rise of more than 30 percent. The increases, it states, result in a dividend payout rate of 41 percent of profits, compared with 50 percent for the post-World War II period. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s explanation: `` The current low payout rate is in large part cyclical. Dividend growth normally lags in periods of strong profit recovery, with payout catching up as profit growth slows.'' While this would suggest futher dividend increases to come, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> is a bit cautious, limiting itself to forecasting `` a reasonably good pace through 1989.'' For this cycle, it explains, the rate of dividend payouts may improve more slowly than normal, because funds that corporations normally set aside for dividends may be siphoned into stock repurchase programs.

 `` <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> is now a boom town,'' said <PERSON> Sanjay </PERSON> <PERSON> Galhotra </PERSON>, a Hindu who owns a hotel and plans to build a four-story shopping center. `` Last year I would have been called a fool.'' Long the center of the bloody, 7-year-old separatist war by <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> radicals, <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> has come alive since Indian government forces a year ago dislodged <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> militants from the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>, holiest shrine of the Sikh faith. But the terror that gripped the city has moved to villages and wheat fields of the countryside of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state, torn by the militant uprising since 1982. `` People do n't care for the militants any more,'' said <PERSON> Amarjit </PERSON> <PERSON> Walia </PERSON>, the owner of an <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> television and appliance shop where business has increased. `` Spirits are high in <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>.'' The most visible change over the past year is at the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>, which gets its name from the gold plating on its walls. Hundreds of pilgrims throng the marble walkway around the shrine, earlier inhabited by rifle-toting militants who had turned it into a fortress. Sikh devotees in orange and blue turbans are accompanied by wives and children. A Hindu visiting the temple is no longer deemed foolhardy. The change came after security forces laid siege to the temple last May. More than 40 people were killed, and in the course of the 10-day siege nearly 200 militants, including many of the separatist movement's leaders, surrendered and were arrested. Police say the clearing of the temple left remaining militants leaderless and without a base of operations. Armed policemen remain on guard outside the temple, searching visitors for weapons, however. But the Sikh militants' war for independence from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> continues in the fields just outside <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>. `` There is terror in the countryside, terror and threats'' said <PERSON> Mukhtiar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, a doctor in the village of <LOCATION> Jagdev </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kalan </LOCATION>, a mud-and-brick hamlet 14 miles north of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>. `` The government is not doing anything for our protection. `` The Hindus had left earlier. Now, Sikhs are joining them to find safety in big towns.'' About 8,000 people, all Sikhs, live in <PERSON> Jagdev </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalan </PERSON>. Most till the wheat fields surrounding the village. Some work at the local school and grocery shops. <PERSON> Mukhtiar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> said the 200 Hindus in the village moved to <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> after an attack by Sikh militants in August, 1987, left at least 12 Hindus and Sikhs dead. Now the militants now turn their guns on fellow Sikhs, accusing them of being police informers or failing to show enough enthusiasm for their movement to separate from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and what they perceive as Hindu domination. Sikhs make up 55 percent of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>'s 20 million population but only 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 880 million people. At least 15 Sikh families have left <PERSON> Jagdev </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalan </PERSON> this year, <PERSON> Mukhtiar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> said. `` The village is not safe,'' said <PERSON> Harbhajan </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, the village's headman `` No one moves out at night, only the police. And if there is a gunshot, all lights in the village go out.'' <PERSON> Mukhtiar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> said wealthy Sikhs are fast becoming the main source of money for the militants. A demand for money is followed by a visit and then an attack on those who do not comply, he said. As ordained by their faith, all Sikh men use the name <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, which means lion in the Punjabi language. `` Militant activity has shifted from fundamentalism to petty crime,'' said <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pal </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, police inspector-general in <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>. `` There is no leadership, so the militants can not get organized. They hit soft targets if they can.'' More than 550 people have been killed in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> this year. At least 2,400 people were killed in the state in 1988. <PERSON> Sarabjeet </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, the top administrator of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> district, said that in the last three months, in the <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> district alone, more than 500 villagers had left their homes for the relative safety of places like <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>, where once-deserted restraurants nowadays are crowded until midnight.

<HEAD>People Rate Religion News Important But Lean To Reading Sports</HEAD>

 Americans think it's more important for newspapers to cover religion than sports, a new national study finds. But people are a bit more likely to read sports stories. Indications also turned up that increasing religious coverage likely wo n't do much to boost circulation, since religion-interested readers already make up the bulk of readership. `` The religious and religion-interested readers are already there,'' says the project director, <PERSON> Steward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. `` Religiosity and newspaper readership are statistically associated.'' Preliminary findings of the study, described as the first comprehensive research on press coverage of religion and interest in it, were presented recently to the Religious Public Relations Council convention in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Concerning the relative news importance of nine special fields, religion was found to rank about in the middle, below education, health and business, but above sports, food, personal advice, entertainment and art. When people were asked to rate their likelihood of actually reading about the topics, religion also ranked in the middle, but below sports. Ahead of sports again were health, education and business. The study, sponsored by <ORGANIZATION> Religious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> under a grant from the <ORGANIZATION> Lilly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION>, included two national Gallup polls of 1,100 samples each, plus in-depth interviews in a variety of local congregations. Contrary to assumptions that people are primarily interested in local religion stories, `` we discovered great expressions of interest in national and international religion stories,'' said <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Weidman </PERSON>, RNS editor-director. In ranking the importance of types of religion news, the polls gave first place to `` social and ethical positions and pronouncements by major faith groups,'' such as on abortion, nuclear policy and the economy. While `` local church news and announcements'' ranked second, all the other highly-rated categories `` were national and international in scope, rather than locally or individualistically oriented,'' <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> said. These included, in this order, `` ethical and social issues,'' the `` role of religion in foreign or international politics,'' the `` role of religion in American politics,'' and `` national religious issues and controversies.'' <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> said the findings undermined `` tried-and true assumptions'' that readers want `` stories of faith and inspiration'' or opinion commentary about religion. These rated low in appeal. `` The findings confirmed what we have been hearing in our local-congregational interviews,'' <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> said. `` People think of religion in national and even global terms. They know it is a dimension of other news. They clearly want that dimension to be covered well.'' Seventy-one percent of those polled called themselves `` daily readers'' and 81 percent said religion is important in their lives. Of these considering religion important, a higher proportion _ 80 percent are daily readers. More than half of the total sample _ 52.2 percent _ said it was important for newspapers to cover religion as well as other kinds of news. Asked how well the press covers the various specialties, sports got the most `` excellent'' scores, followed by business, food and entertainment. But a rather poor job is seen in religious coverage. It ranked seventh. `` The sad truth is that many of this country's almost 1,700 daily newspapers either ignore the religion story or amuptate it at the county line,'' Ms. <PERSON> Weidman </PERSON> said. A still incomplete part of the study involves interviews with eight newspapers regarded as covering religion well. Three already have been visited, the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Times, The Tennessean in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> -RRB- Times. `` What these newspaper executive believe in common is that the religion story is central to interpreting life in their communities and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> culture in general,'' Ms. <PERSON> Weidman </PERSON> said. Debunking an old claim that a news professional needs to be religious to give a fair shake to religion, she quotes <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Wasson </PERSON>, city editor of the Tennessean as saying: `` I'm an atheist myself, but I have great respect for religion as a motivational force in people's lives ... Religion is simply not important to many reporters or editors personally, and thus they do n't understand how personally important it is to readers ... `` I think they do n't understand the richness of coverage available in religion. It's not just socials and churchy things. Religion is very rich turf in news value, and many editors do n't know that.

 `` If I needed shoes and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> was the only place I could get shoes, I would do without them,'' former President <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyerere </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION> once said. `` But if I needed corn and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> was the only place to get corn, I would go to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' Millions of people in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> are both barefoot and hungry these days, and though their leaders are reluctant to admit it, they depend on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> for commerce so conditions wo n't get any worse than they are From war-ravaged <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> to tiny, overcrowded <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION>, the region includes some of the poorest and least developed nations in the world. Almost a decade after nine black-ruled states joined forces in an ambitious effort to lessen their reliance on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, they have yet to tap their economic potential and still are inextricably linked to their southern neighbor. `` In many ways the countries are worse off now than in 1980,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, a South African-based researcher who recently did a study on economic conditions in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` Due to wars, bad internal policies and poor management, there's been very little progress in the region.'' The nine regional states are <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION>, which make up the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coordination </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- SADCC -RRB-. <ORGANIZATION> SADCC </ORGANIZATION> concentrates on the region's two most pressing problems, transportation routes and food supplies. Since it was founded in 1980, the organization has helped increase trade among member states, improved the flow of technology and research, and currently is involved in almost 600 projects that will cost some $ 7 billion. But successes have been limited. Almost three-quarters of the 75 million people in <ORGANIZATION> SADCC </ORGANIZATION> countries remain subsistance farmers and per capita income in the region is less than $ 500 a year, according to <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> figures. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> remains the leading trading partner for seven of the nine <ORGANIZATION> SADCC </ORGANIZATION> countries. Its roads, rails, ports, power stations and communications networks are essential to their economic survival. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 28 million blacks have higher average incomes than in any SADCC country. More than a million workers from neighboring countries earn their livings in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, while the traffic in the opposite direction is minimal. The black-led countries want to reduce reliance on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> not only because they oppose its apartheid policies, but also to take advantage of potentially more efficient trade routes. <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION>, where annual per capita income is about $ 200, spends an extra $ 100 million a year exporting its tobacco, tea and nuts through distant <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> because railway lines in neighboring <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> are mostly inoperative because of guerrilla sabotage, according to <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s estimates. <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>, more than 600 miles north of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, receives more than half its imports via <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> although it has its own <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> port. Five major railways connect landlocked nations of southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to the Indian and <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oceans </LOCATION>. However, four pass through <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, where civil wars dating to the mid-1970s have halted or sharply reduced traffic. `` The region will never have secure food supplies until we can make these rail lines work,'' said <PERSON> Nkwaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Ng </PERSON> ` wanakilala, a spokesman at <ORGANIZATION> SADCC </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters in `` And that wo n't be possible until the fighting stops.'' The region's fifth rail line, which links <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> to the port of <LOCATION> Dar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> es </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salaam </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION>, has been unaffected by war. But poor management has kept it from operating anywhere near full capacity since it was built by the Chinese in the 1970s. About half its 75 locomotives are out of service. Farm-to-market roads throughout southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> range from primitive to non-existent. Crops in the fertile region often rot in the fields. The region has the potential to feed much of the continent, but farmland is often under utilized. Farmers are almost exclusively small-scale growers with little training, equipment or access to government services. <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> is the only <ORGANIZATION> SADCC </ORGANIZATION> country that has more than 100 private commercial farms of several hundred acres or more, according to regional agricultural officials. The Southern African Economist, a magazine published by <ORGANIZATION> SADCC </ORGANIZATION>, noted that regional governments `` blame the decline in food production on a host of factors ranging from adverse weather, escalating costs of fertilizers and longer transport routes to disruption of agriculture by South African-backed terrorists.'' But, it added, the `` blame also lies with the governments themselves, for maintaining subsidies and setting unrealistic producer prices which give farmers no incentive to produce more.'' Despite the gloomy picture, there have been two recent developments that could strengthen southern African economies in the long-term. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has been trying to improve relations with black <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and expressed eagerness to cooperate on development projects. It has agreed to grant independence to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> and says it has stopped supporting guerrilla movements in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> SADCC </ORGANIZATION> has estimated that South African military actions in the region have cost more than $ 10 billion during the 1980s. The more peaceful climate has eased the international pressure for sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, which inevitably would damage its neighbors as well. Also, several countries have begun to pursue market-oriented economies and are moving away from `` African socialism'' and centralized economies. <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION>, long hostile to free enterprise, has been implementing austerity measures backed by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> since President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mwinyi </PERSON> came to power in 1985. `` IMF conditionalities are painful,'' <PERSON> Mwinyi </PERSON> said last year. `` But we have to make a choice between two sharp-pointed spears. It is either we go forward with shops full of expensive commodities or we revert to the days of empty shops.'' <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION> has pursued similar reforms, while <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, both officially socialist, are talking less about ideology and offering some encouragement to foreign investors. At present, <ORGANIZATION> SADCC </ORGANIZATION>'s only economic standout is the arid nation of <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>, where diamond wealth has transformed the country from one of the poorest in the world into one of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s wealthiest states in 22 years of independence. The economy has been growing at roughly 10 percent a year throughout the 1980s and <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION> has foreign reserves of $ 2.3 billion, equal to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s. The government's formula has been a commitment to free enterprise, support for foreign investors and a fiscal policy that is probably the most conservative in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Officials warned of spending curbs this year when the projected budget surplus dipped below $ 200 million.

 When <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> gained independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1964, it had thriving copper mines, abundant farmland and a degree of prosperity that made it the envy of its neighbors. Today more than 1 million Zambians are threatened by famine, the government ca n't pay its bills, and acute shortages of many supplies keep even successful businesses operating at sharply reduced capacities. <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>'s economy has been in a downward spiral since the mid-1970s, and Western economists say its ills have been largely self-induced through bad policies and poor management. Living standards have declined every year during the 1980s, and per capita income was $ 361 in 1988, only marginally higher than when the British left, according to government statistics. Inflation is at least 50 percent, unemployment is high and <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>'s foreign debt of $ 5.5 billion is about twice its annual gross domestic product. `` The government knows it has a serious problem, but it continues to create obstacles and display a hostile attitude toward many businessess, especially small entrepreneurs,'' said a Zambia-based Western economist who requested anonymity. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>'s president since independence, is a harsh critic of Western capitalism, but in 1985 he began an economic restructuring plan sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON> slashed subsidies for a number of consumer goods, including corn meal, which many Zambians eat three times a day. Thousands of people rioted in December, 1986, leaving 15 dead. <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON> responded by breaking relations with the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION>, leaving the landlocked nation of 7.5 million even more desperate for foreign assistance. The government has fixed prices for more than two years on such basic goods as corn meal, sugar, cooking oil and charcoal. The result has been widespread shortages and a bustling black market. Every morning women line up outside supermarkets in <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION>, then buy up scarce items within 30 minutes after the doors open. Some buy more than they need and sell the extra on street corners at double what they paid. <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> is the world's fifth largest copper producer and last year prices were near an all-time high. But production problems and a lack of skilled workers and managers limited output to just over 400,000 tons, well short of the goal of 500,000 tons and nowhere near the 720,000 tons gathered in 1969. The country also had a record corn crop in 1988, but a large portion rotted due to poor transportation. Truck drivers often refuse to travel on unpaved rural roads because spare parts are scarce. <PERSON> Chico </PERSON>, a cab driver in <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION>, gave an example of what it's like. `` If I need a spare tire I have a big problem,'' he said.

 <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Zurbaran </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON>, her commom-law husband and their eight children live in a tin-roofed, three-room shack called a rancho on the slope of a hill overlooking <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>. They consider themselves fortunate. He has a job making bricks 10 to 12 hours a day 100 miles away in <LOCATION> Valencia </LOCATION> for roughly the equivalent of $ 25 a week. The good life for her is being able to feed her the children corn bread and coffee, sometimes with milk, for breakfast; black beans and spaghetti for lunch and again for dinner; and meat on Saturdays, when her husband, <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Zambrano </PERSON>, is home. But <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Zurbaran </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON>, who is 48 years old, said things wo n't be that way much longer She was talking about the recent turn of events in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> _ price increases that set off rioting down on the streets of <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> Feb. 27-March 2, leaving 276 people dead and about 1,000 injured. `` There are several bad years ahead,'' she said. `` Nothing will be easy anymore.'' Some of those who went down into the streets to protest, loot and burn were from <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>'s slum, <LOCATION> Rancholandia </LOCATION>. It is the kind of place in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> where riots, and sometimes revolutions, are born. <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> said she tells her children to prepare themselves for hard times. She has 14 in all _ 7 to 33 years old _ but just eight still live with her. `` I was blessed with 20 children,'' she said, `` but my triplets and another three died in the 60s from disentery.'' Millions like <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> and her family live in ranchos on the hills around Venezuelan cities. <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> and <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> are n't as poor as most of them nor as better off as some of them. She stays at home while he goes off to work Mondays through Thursdays in <LOCATION> Valencia </LOCATION>. Before leaving <LOCATION> Valencia </LOCATION> for home on weekends, he stops at a slaughterhouse and with part of his pay buys a kilo of meat _ 2.2 pounds. `` With <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> at home for the weekend, Saturday is the feast day,'' <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> said. `` Everyone gets a piece of meat mixed with a lot of boiled potatos so that everybody is full for the rest of the day. Maybe it wo n't be every Saturday anymore.'' She was thinking again about the price increases and the riots. The price increases were part of a government austerity program intended to halt the downward economic spiral <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> has been in since the collapse of oil prices a few years ago. The program called for the lifting of subsidies that kept prices low for the poor. At the same time, the bolivar, the local currency, was allowed to float for the first time in decades and prices for unsubsidized goods and services also rose. The government of President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said it had no alternative, but it did not expect people to pour out of the ranchos as they did. They came by the thousands. In <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, at least 50 percent of the population of 4 million lives in ranchos. Sociologists and politicians analyzed the sudden swarm of protest as the revenge of the have-nots against the rich. <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> said she had no part of it. `` Here we are all honest people. The ` malandros' -LRB- criminals -RRB- came from up the hill,'' she said, gesturing with her left thumb. There was n't much hill left before the top and it was hard to determine where the `` malandros'' could have come from. All that can be seen from <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>'s rancho are myriads of other ranchos crammed over the hills like a waving ocean of corrugated metal. Full employment is rare in the ranchos; many people are completely jobless, others are underemployed and still others make a living as street vendors. <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> considers herself lucky because <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> has the brick-making job in <LOCATION> Valencia </LOCATION>, where he stays with his mother during the work week to save bus fare back and forth every day. <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> adds about 400 bolivars -LRB- $ 13 -RRB- to the weekly budget by sewing pants on a neighbor's machine and sweeping a nearby school twice a week. But electricity is free in <LOCATION> Rancholandia </LOCATION> _ people simply hook into the power lines _ and water comes from a public line not far from <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>'s rancho. <PERSON> Ranchos </PERSON> began sprouting in Venezuelan cities only during the last 30 years, while the nation was establishing itself one of the most stable democracies in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Before that, the dictatorial governments that ruled most of the time since independence from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> in 1811 barred the poor from building shacks in the cities. They were kept in rural areas and the few who made it into <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> were constantly harassed by authorities. But after the dictatorship of <PERSON> Marco </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON> collapsed in 1958, the poor were allowed in from the countryside and as the nation's oil economy burgeoned they flocked to the cities for jobs. <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> and other cities soon were overwhelmed by a new socialwing decade when <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> began to swell with oil money the couple built a sturdier one of adobe and concrete blocks a bit further down the hill. `` Now we do have space,'' she said pointing to the narrow, partly walled space where she cooks and does the laundry. At midday, it is the only cool place in her rancho. Heat in the rest of the shack soars over 100 degrees. `` This is the best we could get,'' she said. `` But I think my children will get something even better.''

<HEAD>Studio Theme Park is Centerpiece of Building Boom at Florida Resort</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A $ 400 million blend of big-league film making and <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> stargazing is making its debut as <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s top entertainment resort opens its newest attraction _ the Disney-MGM Studios theme park. The 135-acre complex at <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> combines working movie-TV sound studios with backstage tours for the public, a mixed-media ride-through show and special effects adventures. It's all `` themed'' to the flamboyant ambience of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s Golden Age in the 1930s and'40s, when a small group of moguls ran the studios with a firm hand Art deco and `` <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Crazy'' dominated the architectural styles. The park has its own entrance admission and more than enough activities to fill a visitor's entire day, <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> officials say. Visitors will walk through re-creations of palm-lined <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Grumman </ORGANIZATION>'s Chinese Theater, peek at movies under production, take a role in an ongoing television show, make their own music videos, get a screen test and rub elbows with the stars at the <LOCATION> Brown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Derby </LOCATION> restaurant. Movie and television production began last summer with the `` Superboy'' syndicated TV series and parts of several large-screen films, while construction continued on the tourist portion. Workers were still putting finishing touches on it prior to the opening on May 1. Chairman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisner </PERSON> describes it as one of the <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s most exciting projects `` It is a theatrical environment that is very close to the original conception by <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Disney </PERSON>,'' he said in a recent interview. `` It's been on the shelf since the 1940s and is the culmination of a company dream. This attraction is unlike anything else we have.'' The grand opening to the public is preceded by a weekend of glitzy celebrity parties and previews that include a special on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- April 30 -RRB-, and `` live'' tapings of the TV special and the new `` <ORGANIZATION> Mickey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>'' television series. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunis </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attractions </ORGANIZATION>, believes bringing a bit of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> will lure new fans and encourage former visitors to return. `` We talked of doing a studio tour when <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> was alive,'' said <PERSON> Nunis </PERSON>. `` We've wanted to do this for a long, long time. It's a dream come true.'' Disney will get a full year's jump on its formidable competition, <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION>, which wo n't complete the tour portion of its $ 500 million complex until May 1990. Situated just a few miles down the road, Universal is billed as the nation's largest working studio outside of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>. Movie and TV production is already under way at the facility owned by <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Rank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. It is built on a 440-acre site. Universal will feature what it calls a `` total experience'' of Hollywood-style filmmaking to the public, making the visitor a participant in the action. It expects to attract up to 6 million visitors a year. Disney officials do not project attendance. Despite their well-publicized rivalry, <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> officials downplay the situation, insisting the competition is good for each other as well as <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. `` We've always had competition _ from <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Busch </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gardens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boardwalk </LOCATION> and Baseball and many others,'' <PERSON> Eisner </PERSON> said. `` We welcome competition. It's good for <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Disney does things in its own way, and we feel comfortable that we will have our niche in the community.'' The Disney-MGM theme park is the centerpiece of a $ 1 billion-plus renaissance of the 27,400-acre resort situated in the pine woods and citrus groves of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Kissimmee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>. Not that a rebirth is needed. After earning a record $ 3.4 billion in revenues and $ 522 million in profits in fiscal 1988, the <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has on tap a number of `` openings'' at its <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> resort this year in addition to the studios. On schedule to open this fall is part of what it calls the largest convention-hotel complex in the Southeast. Making their debut this summer will be Typhoon Lagoon -LRB- `` the world's largest water park'' -RRB- and the <LOCATION> Pleasure </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> nighttime entertainment district. Built for the teen-age crowd, <PERSON> Nunis </PERSON> says Typhoon Lagoon will make all other water attractions as obsolete as <ORGANIZATION> Disneyland </ORGANIZATION> made amusement parks in 1955. `` We're finally going to be able to make waves,'' says <PERSON> Nunis </PERSON>. `` Surfing, a 100-foot mountain, a saltwater snorkling reef, including sharks and other live critters -LRB- in an enclosed area -RRB-. I can hardly wait to put on my bathing suit.'' Pleasure Island is for those who still have energy left at the end of an exhausting day at the Disney-MGM Studios park, <LOCATION> Epcot </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Center </LOCATION> or the Magic Kingdom. The complex of restaurants, shops and nightclubs is built on a six-acre island at the Disney Village. On track to open this fall is the 770-room Swan Hotel, which along with the larger <ORGANIZATION> Dolphin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> will form the lodging side of the convention-hotel complex going up near <LOCATION> Epcot </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Center </LOCATION>. The 1,500-room Dolphin is to open in July 1990. Together, the two hotels will cost about $ 375 million and provide 2,300 guest rooms and 200,000 square feet of convention space beside a 50-acre lake. The more modestly priced Caribbean Beach Resort hotel opens an additional 800 rooms this summer for a total of 2,112. The 907-room Grand Floridian Beach Resort, a luxury Victorian-style hotel, opened last summer. Also set for completion this fall will be a new Epcot pavilion, the Wonders of Life, featuring a simulated ride through the human bloodstream and a movie that takes a viewer from conception through birth. Disney does not release attendance figures, but from early indications at <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> _ and with the debut of its new attractions and hotel rooms this year _ it may surpass the record year of 1987. Its <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> parks racked up some 24 million admissions then. Disney World's building spree is boosting its employment rolls and its prices as well. Disney's minimum wage is $ 5 an hour and it has little trouble attracting prospective employees. One of its most-popular spots these days is its employment office, which is currently hiring 2,500 new workers to help staff some of the new attractions. This will boost <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>'s work force of 25,500 by 10 percent in one month. Shortly after the new park opens, <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>'s total of 28,000 year-round `` cast members'' will be twice what it was eight years ago. This figure is swelled by some 5,000 employees of companies that run hotels, restaurants and shops on <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> property, plus parttime workers during seasonal peaks, the company says. The new studio attraction has also prompted a $ 1 increase in one-day admission prices at the Magic Kingdom and Epcot Center, and the introduction of a new four-day passport good at any of the three theme parks, effective May 1. The new ticket will cost $ 94 for adults and $ 77 for children 3 to 9 years old. It provides unlimited admission to the three parks for four days. New single-day admission prices for any one park will be $ 29 for adults and $ 23 for children.

 `` Eight Men Out'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION>. VHS-Beta, $ 89.98. Rated PG -RRB- Who's on first. What's on second. I do n't know is on third. <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON> and <PERSON> Costello </PERSON> made the skit a classic in 1945, and viewers of `` Eight Men Out'' might just revive it. The movie, as earnest as it may be in trying to present the whole tangled scandal of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION> throwing the 1919 World Series, has enough faces and characters in it to pack a locker room. And it would take extra innings to comprehend who's doing what to whom `` Eight Men Out'' begins just as the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION> are about to meet the <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reds </ORGANIZATION> in the World Series. The team is owned by a penny-pinching, manipulative <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Comiskey </PERSON>, who has driven morale into the ground with his cheap wages. Enter scheming, sleazy gamblers to capitalize on the discontent. The ball players are approached by a cast of underworld types, and the deal is hatched for the team to allow the <ORGANIZATION> Reds </ORGANIZATION> to win the series. During the conspiracy, director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sayles </PERSON> introduces the eight crooked players, their wives and sundry girlfriends, at least two gambling kingpins and their assistants, the team's manager and somebody's father. It takes a score card to keep track of the rest. The White-Sox-turned-Black-Sox yarn is a good one, but this movie has too many loose threads.

 Symphony in B-flat; Psalm 23; <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Zemlinsky </PERSON>; <PERSON> Riccardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Chailly </PERSON> conducting the <LOCATION> Radio-Symphonie-Orchester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and Kammerchor -LRB- <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> -RRB- It's always a pleasure to come across an unfamiliar performer giving a familiar work a superlative reading. It's even better to discover exciting, lesser-known music, particularly when the performance is as excellent as that of <PERSON> Chailly </PERSON> and the RSO on this disc. <PERSON> Zemlinsky </PERSON> -LRB- 1871-1942 -RRB- was a prominent teacher, composer and international conductor whose musicial life centered in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. He moved to <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> in 1938, escaped during the war to this country and died, oddly, in <LOCATION> Larchmont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, a suburb of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Schoenberg </PERSON> was his brother-in-law and pupil, and <PERSON> Webern </PERSON> also studied with him. <PERSON> Mahler </PERSON> was a friend and supporter, and <PERSON> Brahms </PERSON> recommended <PERSON> Zemlinsky </PERSON> to his own publisher. No lack of favor from the musical community here. He wrote a quartet of string quartets, a half-dozen works for orchestra and chorus, seven operas and three symphonies, including the B-flat in 1897 _ the year of <PERSON> Brahms </PERSON>' death. The work sounds at times like a cross of the better halves of <PERSON> Brahms </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mahler </PERSON>, though without their depth. But <PERSON> Zemlinsky </PERSON> has his own world of orchestral sound. <PERSON> Chailly </PERSON> understands that. He also seems to understand exactly what to do with each phrase, even more so at times than <PERSON> Zemlinsky </PERSON>, whose style can seem fragmented. Psalm 23 sounds more Mahler-esque, maybe because of the chorus. The recorded sound of the orchestra is crystal clear and nigh perfect. Instruments blend but stand out when need be, never out of balance. The RSO musicians play difficult music with panache. Buy this disc not because no collection is complete without <PERSON> Zemlinksy </PERSON>, but because no listener is complete without a desire to hear the new and unfamiliar. And buy it because <PERSON> Chailly </PERSON> and the RSO deliver a great performance. _ By <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakin </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` Blast Off'' -LRB- EMI <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> -RRB- _ Stray Cats Now this is the way to do a rock' n' roll reunion. Invite a couple of buddies over, turn the speakers up real loud and _ to steal a phrase _ blast off. The Stray Cats, pinup boys and rockabilly revivalists in the long ago days of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first term, drifted apart when the hits stopped coming. Now they're back with `` Blast Off,'' an unexpectedly delightful reunion LP that kicks, snarls, scratches and bites. Unlike most ponderous reunions where middle aged rockers check their lawyers at the door, `` Blast Off'' sounds like that jam session with old friends where someone left a tape recorder on. Sure, it's more complicated than that. But it does n't sound that way, and that's the key. Age has n't diminished the Cats' skill and spirit. It may even have helped; singer <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Setzer </PERSON>'s voice has deepened into an effective growl with none of the precocity of his youth. And producer <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Edmunds </PERSON>, the ultimate kindred spirit, was a perfect choice to guide this project. His voice brightens the catchy singalong, `` Bring It Back Again.'' Do n't look for particularly deep statements. The Stray Cats must set a record for most songs on one 10-song album with the word `` rock'' in the title -LRB- 4 -RRB-. `` Everybody Needs Rock' n' Roll,'' `` Rockabilly Rules,'' `` Rockabilly Worlds'' and `` Rockin' All Over the Place'' are all high octane. For what it aspires to _ the soundtrack for a terrific party _ `` Blast Off'' is a howling success. _ By <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauder </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> McGillis </PERSON> seems so strong-willed and controlled both on the screen and off that you wonder if she ever had doubts in her waitress days that she would reach the top of the acting world. `` Oh yeah, all the time,'' she admits. `` But there's also that part of you _ the driven side _ that says, ` I will,' and has that kind of confidence. But I think you will always have self-doubt. I still do. I continually wonder if I would ever work again. Maybe that's one of the things that drives me.'' Contributing to her air of confidence is her appearance: stately if not quite regal, with a cool beauty that would have melted the late <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitchcock </PERSON>. Was her height ever a drawback? `` Not to me. Maybe to other people, but no, I do n't think so. I suppose people say, ` How come you always play sort of stronger women, not the vulnerable, victim types?' I can maybe attribute that to my height. It's sort of hard to be a victim when you're 5-feet-10 and you're bigger than a lot of guys you're working with. Significantly, <PERSON> Jodie </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> was the gang-rape victim in `` The Accused'' and <PERSON> McGillis </PERSON> was the prosecutor who sought justice for her. In her new film, `` Winter People,'' <PERSON> McGillis </PERSON> plays both victim and protagonist. She is an unwed mother, ostrasized by her family, who stirs up a smoldering mountain feud and then resolves it with an act of supreme sacrifice. The Columbia release was filmed in the locale of the <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ehle </PERSON> novel, the <LOCATION> Blue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>, under conditions that duplicated the hardships of living on the land 50 years ago. `` It was pretty rough to be out in the elements for so many hours a day,'' she recalled. `` It was cold and wet and damp. `` The emotional challenges of playing <PERSON> Coley </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> were very demanding, but that's why I did it. I wanted to see if I could hit those emotional peaks and valleys. `` Coley is a bit rebellious, but at the same time she is very traditional. She is very strong and impetuous, but at the same time very weak and feminine. Which are all sort of interesting things to portray in a character, because that's how we are in real life.'' Any resemblance between <PERSON> Coley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>? `` Mmmm, yeah, I think so,'' she said. `` I think that I'm a bit rebellious, and yet very traditional at the same time. And I think I'm strong and weak at the same time. I'm very single-minded when I get an idea; nothing can stand in my way or change my mind.'' Filmmakers have discovered that about <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> McGillis </PERSON>. While she does n't push her weight around on a set, she does like to contribute to the creative process. And why not? `` I must say I've been very fortunate in not working with that type of -LRB- dictatorial director -RRB-. I've always felt that I could at least bring up an idea, and they can say, ` That's not a good idea,' or, ` I do n't like that.' I do n't take that personally. `` I've never worked with the kind of person who said, ` Just shut up and do it this way.' If I did, I probably would rebel a lot,'' she said. `` After a certain amount of time, an actor or an actress knows their character better than anyone else around. Once you've assimilated and really become this person, you know what you would do in a given situation than anyone else on that set. <PERSON> McGillis </PERSON>, 31, spent her early years in <LOCATION> Thousand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oaks </LOCATION>, halfway between <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ventura </LOCATION>. By a weird coincidence, her father was physician for her `` Winter People'' co-star, <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, then a Disney child star. `` I had a big crush on him when I was 8 years old,'' she said. The <PERSON> McGillis </PERSON> family moved to <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. `` We went on vacation and never came back.'' `` When I was in high school I took theater,'' said <PERSON> McGillis </PERSON>, whose new hair style is close-cropped blond and brown. `` I dropped out of high school to pursue acting, which did n't make my family happy. I studied a few years at the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> Conservatory of the Performing Arts, then I was accepted to <LOCATION> Julliard </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where I studied for four years.'' During her last year at the <ORGANIZATION> Julliard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, she auditioned for a role with <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Conti </PERSON> in `` Reuben, <PERSON> Reuben </PERSON>.'' She appeared in a few TV movies without much notice. Then director <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Weir </PERSON> saw her in `` Reuben, <PERSON> Reuben </PERSON>'' and wanted her to test for the Amish woman opposite <ORGANIZATION> Harrison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> in `` Witness.'' `` I said, ` Of course, I know all about the Amish,' but I really did n't,'' she said, `` so I had to spend the weekend in the library. `` I had just gotten a job as a waitress in a restaurant where I had wanted to work for a long, long time. When they finally offered me ` Witness' a week later, I felt so bad about quitting the other job. You always want to work in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> restaurant where there is minimal work and a lot of money.'' Even after the film she applied for another waitress job because she was worried she'd never work again. `` Witness'' and `` Top Gun'' eased her insecurity. Now she can even take a few months off, as she and her boat broker husband, <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Tillman </PERSON>, recently did, ferrying a yacht from the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>The Artists: A Kaleidoscope of Art Deco Shapes and Forms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAF CASERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An unprecedented show on art deco brings together some of the best decorative works of the 1920s from 12 European nations to redefine the whimsical, elitist style of the rich and powerful. In all, 274 pieces _ from fine jewelry and glassware to massive, bulky dressers _ are on show until the end of May at the Beaux-Arts Palace, itself an art deco gem, to mark its 60th anniversary this year. The `` Art Deco in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'' exhibit aims to shed new light on the much-abused concept of the movement by highlighting work from as far apart as <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. The style is an eclectic ode to superficial prettiness for the rich who failed or refused to face the harsh social realities of the 1920s. The difference between art deco and other styles of its age is often very thin, said exhibit organizer <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambrechts </PERSON>, explaining why art deco has often been confused with, and used as, an amalgam of everything from stark modernism to flamboyant rococo. The kaleidoscope of forms and shapes at the Beaux-Arts Palace might still leave many visitors lost for a uniform vision of art deco. But then, <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Deco </PERSON> loved to `` quote'' from foreign and bygone styles, from the Japanese and Chinese cultures from rococo and classicism, much in the same way that postmodernism does today. <PERSON> Lambrechts </PERSON> said only the social idea behind the pieces constituted the art deco style. `` There is no unity of form, no real style,'' he said, only a common attitude of snobbery and elitism among art deco artists and buyers. Through his show, <PERSON> Lambrechts </PERSON> paints a picture of a gilded cage in which a spoiled European elite sought to shield itself from the revolutionary changes that swept society early this century. It did so by cultivating an art that had no meaning other than to please the eye. In contrast, the contemporary modernism of <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbusier </PERSON> and <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gropius </PERSON> thrived on the new technologies and social developments art deco shunned. Through its devotion to function and lack of ornament, it gave shape to many of world's modern cities. `` In almost all the capitals of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the high bourgeoisie tried to compensate the threat to its power with a refined culture, while the new rich wanted to create an identity by purely showing off,'' <PERSON> Lambrechts </PERSON> said. In return, <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Deco </PERSON> was dismissed as kitschy and tasteless for many decades. But in recent years it has found a new following as evidenced by the fact that over 2,000 people a day visited Lambrechts' show, which opened March 3 at <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Horta </PERSON>'s Beaux-Arts Palace in the center of <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> have long claimed to be the cradle of art deco. But Lambrechts' show breaks new ground there. It shows strong contributions from across <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, many of them on display for the first time outside their home countries. The exhibit is not as complete as Lambrechts would have liked, as much art deco was destroyed in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> who considered it decadent. Still, culled from 101 museums and private collections from around <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, it shows a lot of `` previously undiscovered beauty among the best arts and crafts this century has produced,'' <PERSON> Lambrechts </PERSON> said. What all the pieces have in common is a sense of luxury, expert finishing and craftmanship. Leaf-gold, silver, gems, <LOCATION> china </LOCATION>, delicate woods _ no costs were spared to produce a unique work of art deco. While modernists employed concrete and steel to allow function to prevail over style, art deco only wanted to impress with its flashy materials and ornaments. And impress they did. Dutchman <PERSON> Hendrik </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Den </PERSON> <PERSON> Eynde </PERSON> was lavish enough in his use of silver. But his 1918 urn flanked by four statuettes, shows some of the restraint other works at the show dearly lack. At the other end of the spectrum, Austrian <PERSON> Anny </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON> outrages with loud, clashing colors and seemingly irrelevant drawings of hunters and exotic deer on her 1919 mask. And nowhere is craftmanship and use of rich materials more evident than in the art deco jewelry of the <PERSON> Maison </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleef </PERSON> and Arpels. Its 1927 vanity brooch of gold, enamel, christal, emerald, rubies and diamonds wrought by master hands is one of the highlights of the exibit. After spending some decades in relative obscurity, dealers are also quickly re-evaluating art deco. Some small tables have been sold for close to $ 1 million, and prices for all objects are rising constantly. `` Times have changed,'' said <PERSON> Lambrechts </PERSON>. `` Today art deco is even more expensive than French art of the 18th century.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: He Loves To Do That Wild Thang</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Tone Loc, the raspy-voiced rapper whose bawdy `` Wild Thing'' went to the top of the charts, did n't think the tune about a pickup artist on a streak of amazing luck was hit material. `` The record company -LRB- Delicious Vinyl -RRB- did. I did n't. It's not my style of rap,'' the 22-year-old <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> native said in a recent interview. `` I mean, ` Loc'd After Dark' is really my style of rap _ slow and funky, that's how I like it.'' The song was a No. 1 hit for Loc, whose real name is <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. <PERSON> Loc </PERSON> is short for loco, a gang term for a crazy man who likes to fight. But <PERSON> Loc </PERSON>, who grew up in a two-story house on the affluent west side of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and went to <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, had to travel by bus to the city's tough south side to get his reputation. He was uncomforable dwelling on gangs during the interview. However, in the past he has said he was involved with a gang during his teens but withdrew because a girlfriend asked him to _ a choice kids locked into the southside scene usually do n't get. But his commuter-gang experience had nothing to do with his interest in rap, he said. `` I found it out on my own, clear out of the blue.'' <PERSON> Loc </PERSON> said a friend from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> came to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> about eight years ago with a tape that he rapped along to. `` I never saw anybody rap live before. It was pretty new, especially out here. I went home and tried to write one of my own, and it sounded pretty cool,'' he said. All the original big rappers, such as <PERSON> Kurtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Blow </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kool </PERSON> <PERSON> Moe </PERSON> <PERSON> Dee </PERSON>, were from the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. Only recently have <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> rappers been taken seriously in the genre. Early 1980s acts such as the <ORGANIZATION> LA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dream </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Team </ORGANIZATION> failing to take hold. <PERSON> Loc </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> rappers now have developed their own laid-back style rather than trying to imitate the uptempo hip-hop from the East. `` We've grown tremendously out here,'' he said. `` We've got a groove that slow. I'm a slower, more mellow type.'' <PERSON> Loc </PERSON>'s own rap experience came during high school, with a group called the Triple A's because all the members first names began with `` A.'' `` There really was n't too much happening with it. I think we were too good for our time,'' he said. Loc was a rap retiree by age 20, but took it up again when the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> rap scene began to heat up. A cousin introduced him to <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Dike </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, founders of the small Delicious Vinyl label, and two of <PERSON> Loc </PERSON>'s records, `` I Got It Goin' On'' and `` I'm on Fire,'' received play on local station <ORGANIZATION> KDAY </ORGANIZATION> But it was the crossover appeal of `` Wild Thing,'' which got play on new wave station <ORGANIZATION> KROQ </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> last fall, that helped launch Loc, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> rap, and Delicious Vinyl, now distributed by <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>. As for `` Wild Thing,'' <PERSON> Loc </PERSON> said he pieced the song together pretty much from personal experience. `` You change a little bit here and there, but the idea comes from something that happened to you,'' he said. Does he get any static for the lyrics? `` Nah. All the girls I know love it,'' he laughed. `` Besides, they know it's all true.'' Loc is currently on tour for his album `` Loc'd After Dark,'' which is climbing the Billboard pop and black charts, facing crowds of up to 18,000 in arenas. `` I was playing clubs in January and February,'' he said. `` It's different, but it's the same I really like the hype.'' And the crowds join in on `` Wild Thing.'' `` They rap right along with it,'' <PERSON> Loc </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Loc </PERSON> is casual so far about his own success. When asked, he did n't know exactly where his records were on the charts, except to say `` I know a lot of people are buying them.'' There is also street recognition for the husky 6-foot-1 Loc, who appears in the heavy rotation `` Wild Thing'' video clip, which borrows the expressionless all-woman band from <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>'s `` I Did n't Mean to Turn You On.'' <PERSON> Loc </PERSON>'s own stock is soaring, and he finds some things more difficult to do, such as shopping in a mall. `` When I'm shopping or eating, I get swarmed. You can hear people saying ` Is that Tone Loc? Yeah, that's him.' But they're always nice to me and stuff, and I love that Plus, I can get into a lot more clubs now,'' he said laughing. `` It's nothing like <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> or anything, but I can definitely tell the difference,'' he said.

<HEAD>Books and Authors: V.S. Naipaul Takes His Turn in the South</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENEVA COLLINS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 From `` Gone With the Wind'' to `` A Southern Family,'' writers have addressed the South with much sound and fury. But V.S. <PERSON> Naipaul </PERSON> has used his acute eye to furnish some fresh insights in `` A Turn in the South.'' <PERSON> Naipaul </PERSON>, a Trinidadian of Indian descent who has lived in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> for nearly four decades, spent six months traveling through the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, studying race relations, religion, the romance with the past and its wary concessions to progress. `` A Turn in the South'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Knopf </ORGANIZATION>; $ 18.95 -RRB- takes the reader from <LOCATION> Greensboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Naipaul </PERSON> begins his sojourn, through <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Tuskegee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, Miss.; <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, and back to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Chapel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. He shows us Confederate monuments and catfish ponds, a self-proclaimed redneck and a <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> songwriter, fundamentalist preachers and a futuristic <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> assembly plant. The Oxford-educated <PERSON> Naipaul </PERSON> is the author of 19 other books, eight of them non-fiction works such as this one in which he exhaustively explores a locale; they are much too complex to be considered mere travel books. He is best known for his caustic pictorials of Third World countries, in both his nonfiction -LRB- `` <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>: A Wounded Civilization,'' `` The Loss of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dorado </LOCATION>,'' `` The Middle Passage'' -RRB- and his novels -LRB- `` A Bend in the River,'' `` Guerrillas,'' `` In a Free State'' -RRB-. For example, `` Among the Believers,'' his controversial 1981 account of the Islamic faith in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, probably would elicit a death threat from the <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> if it were issued today. One of the pleasures of reading `` A Turn in the South'' is experiencing the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> through the eyes of a world traveler. `` The land was flat, like the pampas of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> or the llanos of <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Naipaul </PERSON> writes of <LOCATION> Greensboro </LOCATION>. Interviewing <PERSON> Naipaul </PERSON> about the writing of this book is another experience altogether. He detests interviews, submits to them only on the insistence of his publisher and endures them with a pained air and mostly terse responses. Asked in a recent interview, for example, to explain what kind of advance work he does before setting out on a destination, he said curtly: `` I do n't. I do n't do any research.'' When the interviewer points out that in his book he says he has obtained letters of introduction, that this sounds like advance preparation, and asks him how he decides whom to contact, <PERSON> Naipaul </PERSON> responded, `` That is always difficult.'' When pressed to elaborate, he would add only, `` It varies from place to place. It is one of the difficulties of the traveling business.'' Asked if he read any Southern authors beforehand, such as <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Faulkner </PERSON> or <PERSON> Eudora </PERSON> <PERSON> Welty </PERSON> -LRB- whom he interviewed in `` A Turn in the South'' -RRB-, he snapped: `` That's fatal. I always refuse to read in advance.'' After a pause he added, `` I always try to see what I've found. I'm a fairly well-educated, well-read person, and I've spent all my life writing, and I have a rough idea of the history of places. I like to go and see what I find and move from there. I do n't want to be reacting against other people's views.'' In `` A Turn in the South'' <PERSON> Naipaul </PERSON> writes that this will be his last travel theme book. Why abandon a format that has served him so well? `` I felt it at the time. I felt I was getting on,'' said <PERSON> Naipaul </PERSON>, who is 56. `` But what happened was I was so energized by it -LRB- researching the book -RRB-, so excited, so delighted _ I was so delighted by the method I had stumbled on in my middle 50s. I found it so true and interesting, and I so marveled that I had n't alighted on it before I found that at the end of it quite a bit of energy remaining _ or generated _ and I thought I should do a little more before my chest absolutely packs up on me.'' -LRB- <PERSON> Naipaul </PERSON> suffers from asthma. -RRB- The methodology to which he referred is to interview a wide range of people and to let them do the talking, rather than his old habit of spending a long period in a given place, quietly observing and analyzing, which he now says gives a more prejudiced account. <PERSON> Naipaul </PERSON> seems unaware that the `` new'' method he has stumbled upon is that used daily by journalists. <PERSON> Naipaul </PERSON>'s next trip will be to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, where he has traveled extensively, but he did n't know if a book would come of it. He said that because of his poor health he views every book as his last.

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Roy Clark A Country Music Ambassador</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Country music performer <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, the longtime star of the `` Hee Haw'' TV show, thinks the cornpone program would be received well in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> has made two concert tours of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, most recently giving 12 performances last November. He previously made 18 concert appearances in 1976. `` I'm sure they would be bewildered by the corny jokes, but the overall image of ` Hee Haw' would be compatible with their entertainment,'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said in an interview. `` They are interested in the history of the American West such as the cowboys. `` You see audiences in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in fringe and cowboy hats and the Soviets are the same way. They would identify with that image of ` <PERSON> Hee </PERSON> <PERSON> Haw </PERSON>.''' The 56-year-old <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, who has been host of the show since it first aired 21 years ago, foresees an entire wave of new viewers. `` There's a generation of young people who get together on Saturday nights and use it as an excuse to have a party in the -LRB- college -RRB- dorm,'' he said. `` It's gone around and made a complete cycle. We may become another fad. I have a feeling it will outlast me.'' The program, which is seen on more than 200 stations, is taped every June and October. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> says the fact that it's not a months-long process has contributed to the show's longevity. `` This keeps it fresh,'' he said by telephone from his office in <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION> `` We're not around each other enough to get on each other's nerves. It's a natural high energy for us to perform because it's like starting over twice a year.'' When <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> first appeared on the show, he already had been performing on prime-time network TV variety shows. But he said `` Hee Haw'' capped his career. `` This was the icing on the cake,'' he said. `` This put my face and name together.'' His recent appearances in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have embellished his role as one of country music's major ambassadors. After his first tour there 13 years ago, which was made with the <ORGANIZATION> Oak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boys </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Country </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> gave him the title `` international friendship ambassador.'' He also performed in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> last year where his concert was broadcast live and seen by more than 500 million people in socialist countries. `` There's a special feeling when you play in a foreign country,'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. `` It's not just another concert. There is a lot of responsibility on your shoulders. `` You are representing your country first of all. Also you must represent your music well. The opinions of your performance reflects back on all the other country music performers. If the people do n't like it, they will think that's what all of country music is like. `` Your adrenalin definitely flows a little faster.'' His appearances were taped for television broadcast throughout Eastern Bloc countries. Soviet officials told him his concerts would be seen by 700 million people by the time they are broadcast and rebroadcast several times. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nashville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> on cable TV is carrying two one-hour specials about <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>'s Soviet shows. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said such a huge audience is a bit intimidating. `` The first thing you think about is how many mistakes you made,'' he said, chuckling. `` You wonder how many flat notes you hit and whether you looked tired and were at your best. `` But it was gratifying. There's nothing like recognition.'' He said the Soviet people were especially interested in the banjo. Crowds would gather at the foot of the stage to get a close look at his instruments, especially the banjo. `` You could tune one up and they would love it,'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. `` They know the history of it as an authentic American instrument. They know it speaks of our heritage. And they like that brilliant sound of the banjo.'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Meherrin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, grew up in <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clairsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. His father was a computer programmer for the federal government. He learned to play a homemade ukulele as a youngster and got his first guitar at age 14. He is accomplished on the 12-string guitar, acoustic guitar, banjo and fiddle and also plays five other instruments. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> has dabbled in acting, co-starring in the 1986 movie `` Uphill All the Way'' with <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Tillis </PERSON>. He's also appeared in the TV shows `` The Odd Couple'' and `` The Beverly Hillbillies.'' He is now approaching 30 years as a performer, having celebrated his 25th anniversary in 1985, and his foreign concert tours are not over. He plans to return to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> within two years. `` I'd like to keep the friendship going,'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said.

 Stock prices posted spotty losses Monday as traders cashed in some of the market's recent gains. The Dow Jones industrial average, up 72.40 points last week, slipped 6.78 to 2,402.68. The dollar drifted higher against most major currencies. Bond prices finished little changed. Weekend showers in one of the driest parts of the Corn Belt triggered a steep sell-off of corn and soybean futures; oats closed lower; wheat futures gained slightly; energy futures plunged; precious metals advanced; and livestock and meat futures were mixed.

 Nearly a century after <PERSON> Chauncey </PERSON> <PERSON> Wing </PERSON> invented a simple device to stick mailing labels onto newspapers, his great-grandson is turning out almost identical Wing Mailers, handcrafted on turn-of-the-century lathes, for modern newspapers. `` Times change, but the Wing <PERSON> Mailer </PERSON> just goes along,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Wing </PERSON>, the latest in the long line of <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> tinkerers and inventors to preside over the little brick mill in this northwestern <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> town. He estimated that 3,000 to 4,000 of the devices are being used by newspapers ranging from large metropolitan dailies, such as <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Hartford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Courant </ORGANIZATION>, to hometown weeklies. `` Many bigger papers use it to back up their computerized systems. The fancy electronics are only as good as the people who operate and fix them and they still have to get out the papers when the power goes off,'' said Wing. `` And for the smaller papers it can be a lot more economical.'' The device, which feeds a strip of mailing labels through a glue well and then cuts and affixes the labels onto the newspapers with a pull of the thumb, was invented in 1894. The family-owned company still occasionally gets back for repairs mailers made 50 and 60 years ago, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sevrens </PERSON>, who manages the five-employee factory. The only difference between these older models and the ones made today is that after the 1920s, the mailers were made of aluminum instead of brass. Today the mailers cost about $ 215. Even the cherry-wood handles that <PERSON> Chancey </PERSON> <PERSON> Wing </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>, editor of the <ORGANIZATION> Greenfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazette </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Courier </PERSON>, chose for the mailer when <PERSON> Grover </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleveland </PERSON> was in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> remain, still turned on a foot-driven lathe. `` There would be no purpose to changing,'' said Wing, 45. `` Our customers are familiar with it as it is. And we do n't care about being modern.'' In its one concession to the computer age, the company last year unveiled a new model, without a glue well, to handle pre-glued computer labels. But otherwise the 2 -LCB- - pound machine that has outlasted all its competitors is a hand-held anachronism in the heavily computerized newspaper industry The factory's only pause was during World War II when <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wing </PERSON>, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON>'s father, halted production to mill parts for top-secret radar research. The company's sales, including supplies, totaled $ 250,000 last year, <ORGANIZATION> Wing </ORGANIZATION> said. To step into the plant, near the family home, is to walk into the 19th century. `` Most of the machines were made here and some even predate the mailer,'' said Wing. A turn-of-the-century, five-horsepower electric motor in the basement powers the more than two dozen gear cutters, taps, dies and presses through an intricate arrangement of leather belts and pulleys that whir overhead. `` The electric bill for the whole plant is about $ 20 a month,'' said <PERSON> Sevrens </PERSON>' wife, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON>, the office manager. It's hard to find people with the skill and inclination to work, often by eye, on the old machines, <PERSON> Sevrens </PERSON> said, but his fascination came early. `` I grew up in the neighborhood and did odd jobs for <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wing </PERSON>,'' said the young machinist. `` He was interested in everything and always working on all sorts of things. Tinkering. I just thought he was kind of a neat guy.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Haskins </PERSON>, 78, who retired and returned twice `` because I do n't have a place where I can have a hobby,'' said he would n't want to work on a modern, computerized milling machine `` There's a nature to man that can be lost,'' he said. `` A machine can make a standard socket, but when you're finished there's nothing of toolmaker in it.''

 <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said the Wall Street slowdown has prompted the investment firm to reduce its staff by about 200 employees through a combination of attrition, voluntary departures and layoffs.

 <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> can revive its stagnant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sales and pull away from competitors by getting closer to its customers, Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Akers </PERSON> told shareholders at their annual meeting. `` <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> must become a company ... that wo n't rest until every customer is not just satisfied, but delighted, with every association with <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said here Monday. `` Everything else will follow, market share, revenue, profit, returns and stockholder value. `` We intend to accomplish all this ... not by selling them smaller and faster machines to replace more clerical duties, but rather working more closely with them to get an ever deeper understanding of their businesses,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s revenue in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the largest single market for the world's largest computer manufacturer, declined 0.7 percent last year to $ 25.3 billion. Measured in local currencies, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> sales grew 21 percent last year, the most among <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s major geographic markets, <PERSON> Akers </PERSON> said. Revenue in local currencies grew by 14 percent in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, and by 9 percent in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Because of changes in the value of the dollar in terms of various foreign currencies, the dollar value of foreign revenue was different from the value in local currencies. Overall, revenue outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> increased 15.5 percent to $ 34.4 billion when measured in dollars. By the same measure, the greatest revenue growth was 27.7 percent in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, followed by growth of 21 percent to $ 3.9 billion in the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION>, according to the company's annual report. <PERSON> Akers </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> is battling rapid advances in computer technology, growing needs of customers and thousands of competing companies, from the small and nimble to the big full-line vendors. `` As a result, the industry is under a good deal of stress as evidenced by pressure on profitability and decline in stock prices, including <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s stock price, over the last several months,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Armonk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, remains `` the most profitable company in the world and continues to lead all American companies in market value,'' <PERSON> Akers </PERSON> said. First-quarter profit totaled $ 950 million, or $ 1.61 per share, on revenue of $ 12.7 billion. After adopting a new treatment of deferred taxes, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> restated its 1988 first-quarter profit as $ 1.2 billion, or $ 1.57 per share, on revenue of $ 12 billion. Without the accounting change, the 1989 first quarter would have represented a 1.8 percent increase in profits. While in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> for the annual shareholders meeting Monday, the board increased the regular quarterly dividend 10 percent, from $ 1.10 per share to $ 1.21 per share. Management received overwhelming support for a proposal to expand a program of awarding stock options to executives. The company's Long-Term Peformance Plan will enable the top officers to receive stock as well as cash. Shareholders rejected a proposal to force <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> to discontinue selling computers and services in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, where it no longer owns a subsidiary. The proposal was supported by 14.5 percent of the shares voted. A proposal that would have required management to report to shareholders on any ways in which <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> supports painful laboratory experiments on animals received 7.8 percent of the shares voted. Management opposed both proposals.

 The clock is running out for South Africa-linked <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.A. </ORGANIZATION> _ the world's largest gold producer _ to complete its hostile takeover of <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fields </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, the No. 2 gold concern. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mukasey </PERSON>, who issued a preliminary injunction barring the takeover bid in October, on Monday rejected another request by <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> to lift or modify his order. <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 4 billion bid expires at 1 p.m. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> time Wednesday, and unless the Luxembourg-based conglomerate is able to acquire half of <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fields </ORGANIZATION>' shares by the deadline, it would be barred from attempting another takeover for one year under British law. <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> controls 29.6 percent of the stock of Gold Fields. Last month, the 2nd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> upheld <PERSON> Mukasey </PERSON>'s original injunction against further Gold Fields stock acquisition by <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> because it might violate <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> antitrust laws. <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>, through its various holdings, `` is the largest producer of gold in the non-communist world, accounting for 20.3 percent of all gold production,'' according to court papers. Last fall, <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>, which is largely controlled by two South African corporations, <ORGANIZATION> Anglo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, launched a hostile takeover bid for Gold Fields. But Gold Fields resisted and filed an antitrust action in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, sparking one of the largest takeover battles in British history. <PERSON> Mukasey </PERSON>'s preliminary injunction last fall prevented <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> from proceeding with its tender offer until the antitrust issue is resolved. Just before <PERSON> Mukasey </PERSON>'s ruling, the bid was referred to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Monopolies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mergers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to consider possible anti-competitive consequences in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION> on such strategic metals as titanium and zircon British law prohibited further action on the takeover bid until Feb. 2, when the commission held that acquisition of Gold Fields would not be against the British public interest. With that ruling, <PERSON> Mukasey </PERSON>'s injunction remained the only legal obstacle to <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>'s offer. Last week, <PERSON> Mukasey </PERSON> rejected a <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> bid to lift or modify the stay. To eliminate antitrust conflicts, <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> offered to sell substantial <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fields </ORGANIZATION> subsidiaries _ Gold Fields of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, U.S.-based <ORGANIZATION> Newmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and Australian-based <ORGANIZATION> Renison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Goldfields </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> _ and not buy them back for 10 years. But <PERSON> Mukasey </PERSON> said there was no guarantee the other Minorco-linked entities _ <ORGANIZATION> DeBeers </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Anglo </ORGANIZATION> American _ would n't buy back the subsidiaries and keep the transactions secret under sympathetic South African laws. He noted at the time that he `` enjoined the takeover because the resulting combination would control 32.3 percent of the non-communist world gold market.'' On Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Anglo </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> DeBeers </ORGANIZATION> offered to put up a total of $ 300 million bond and pledged not only to sell the previously mentioned properties but to not buy them back for at least 10 years. But <PERSON> Mukasey </PERSON> rejected that offer because, he said, `` members of the <ORGANIZATION> Anglo </ORGANIZATION> group other than <ORGANIZATION> Anglo </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> DeBeers </ORGANIZATION> ... remain free to purchase shares in the three companies.''

Eastern's unions as well as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> have been pushing for a sale of the entire carrier by its parent, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. If management's plan were approved, Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> would cut its fleet size to 157 aircraft from the current 255 and the number of cities served to 77 from a pre-strike 102. Eastern President <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakes </PERSON> would not specify all the cities where <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> would cut service, but told a press briefing the company would sell its <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> shuttle service and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> hub, along with a total of 117 unspecified airport gates and 28 landing slots, and de-emphasize some foreign routes. While keeping many of the plan's details under wraps, <PERSON> Bakes </PERSON> did say <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> would retain its <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> hub, its routes linking <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> cities with <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and some or all of its <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> service. The <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> hub, which vies with <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>, accounts for 35 percent to 40 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s total revenue. `` I think it's very aggressive but I think it's possible,'' said <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Neidl </PERSON>, a securities analyst at <ORGANIZATION> McCarthy </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Crisanti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Maffei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> who follows <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Neidl </PERSON> and other observers believe the plan could strip <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> down mainly to its heavy North-South routes on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, eliminating its East-West runs. As the airline's network is currently structured, the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> is densely covered but routes become much sparser as they move west _ they mainly include cities such as <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Eastern also could sell its <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> routes and part of its <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> service, possibly including its hub in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Neidl </PERSON> suggested. Eastern has been flying substantially reduced schedules since a March 4 strike by its <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union, which was joined by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s pilots and flight attendants unions. The company sought federal bankruptcy court protection from creditors on March 9. Under the new plan, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> would emerge from Chapter 11 by September, <PERSON> Bakes </PERSON> said _ a target that <PERSON> Neidl </PERSON> called overly optimistic. Fleet size would be reduced by aircraft sales and by leasing planes to other carriers, Bakes said. Employment at the scaled-down Eastern would total about 17,000, down from a pre-strike 30,000, Bakes said. The total would include 1,700 pilots, down from 3,600 before the strike, he said. Eastern would cut its daily scheduled flight hours to 1,473 from 2,076 under the plan. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashby </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said the plan would not work, partly because <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> would not be able to get enough pilots to fly its planes. Bakes said Eastern plans to hire and train new pilots at the rate of 200 a month. Eastern indicated that by yearend under the plan it would have $ 1.8 billion in net cash from asset sales, giving it a net cash balance of $ 774 million after paying creditors and pension obligations. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> has insisted he no longer is interested in selling all of Eastern, following the collapse of a proposed $ 464 million deal with a group led by former Baseball Commissioner <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>. The federal bankruptcy examiner for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> said Monday that further bids to acquire the airline could be made as early as this week by suitors who include hotel executive <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>.

 Rather than wage a bitter battle with <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has withdrawn its $ 2.4 billion takeover attempt, scuttling what would have been the largest merger in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banking history. `` I recommended to our board of directors that we terminate the offer,'' <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> McColl </PERSON> said Monday. `` I did so because, as was evident in our proposal and throughout subsequent communications, we were committed to a friendly merger,'' he said. `` The management and directors of C & amp; S, for reasons satisfactory to themselves, have decided not to accept our offer. I see no benefit in continuing it.'' The announcement was made after the close of trading Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> had risen 25 cents a share to $ 36.37 -LCB- and <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Southern had fallen 62 -LCB- cents a share to $ 34. The merger, which consisted of a stock swap, would have created the nation's sixth-largest banking company. But the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> bank refused to discuss the proposal. C & amp; S chairman <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said he `` believed from the beginning that this offer was not in the best interests of our shareholders, customers, employees and communities, and that it would meet significant regulatory difficulties and public policy concern.'' `` Both these fine institutions can now get back to the business of banking and serving their communities,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. One analyst said he was n't surprised by <PERSON> McColl </PERSON>'s decision to drop the bid because <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> needed the merger to be friendly. `` They wanted to retain the management strengths of C & amp; S,'' said the analyst, <ORGANIZATION> Dennis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Just four months ago, <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION>, which has assets of more than $ 50 billion, effectively doubled its size when it was selected by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to acquire the largest bank in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Since 1982, <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> has expanded aggressively into new markets in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. The First RepublicBank move was the biggest until the C & amp; S offer. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, a bank stock analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Wheat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, agreed that <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> could not go ahead with the takeover bid without the support of C & amp; S's managment. `` I think you have to take them at their word,'' he said. `` They said they wanted a friendly merger. It was important as they approached the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> market that they had the endorsement of the folks at C & amp; S.'' <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> of Wheat First's <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> office added that <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> needed a friendly merger because `` they have a full plate in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Shea </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> was going after a respected bank with a strong management team that could have offered the <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> bank considerable help down the road in its expansion into <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. `` If C & amp; S continued to refuse to negotiate, <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> was not going to pull off a friendly merger,'' he said. `` I think <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> realized that it could not negotiate in a vacuum. They could n't just keep upping the price.'' <PERSON> Shea </PERSON> also suggested that <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> may have underestimated C & amp; S's unwillingness to participate in the deal <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> made the offer, which would have created a banking company with assets of $ 76 billion, on March 30, and on April 3, the C & amp; S board rejected the offer. At the time, C & amp; S called the bid `` inadequate,'' and said C & amp; S' present management was better able to serve the bank's customers, shareholders and communities than <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> continued to court C & amp; S, asking for face-to-face meetings, and adding different elements to the proposals, including a plan to move <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION>'s Southeast banking headquarters to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. On April 13, <PERSON> McColl </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and vowed to continue to pursue to the offer, though he did not meet with any C & amp; S officials. Five days later, C & amp; S Chairman <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> urged shareholders to support the <ORGANIZATION> C </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; S board in its rejection of the <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> offer. `` Let me put it bluntly,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said at the time. `` <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> can not afford C & amp; S.'' Last week, <PERSON> McColl </PERSON> announced that his bank would increase its bid if C & amp; S officials agreed to meet with <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> executives. <PERSON> McColl </PERSON> did not indicate how high the offer would go.

<HEAD>NWA Board Rejects Davis Offer, Amends Court Complaint</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAGAN, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Calling parts of oilman <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' $ 2.7 billion bid for <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> illegal and unfinanced, <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors unanimously rejected the offer and moved to take further court action to block the efforts. The board on Monday reaffirmed its willingness to negotiate with suitors, including <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, `` in the interest of producing a transaction that is in the best interests of all <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> shareholders.'' But it said it will seek a quick hearing on a motion to enjoin <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' $ 90-a-share tender offer. The board also said it is working with an undisclosed number of other parties that have indicated an interest in acquiring <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's fourth-largest carrier. <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> stock closed at $ 102.75 Monday, up 25 cents a share in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite trading. In an amended complaint in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> board said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' financing plan would exceed federal margin rules aimed at limiting the amount of credit used to buy stock. The board said $ 1.25 billion in preferred stock financing planned for <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' buyout actually should be considered debt. The motion also claims <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' tender offer actually was an illegal proxy solicitation that provided insufficient information to shareholders regarding the source and availability of $ 450 million in equity <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said he would provide for the buyout. In addition, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> Commerce Commissioner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said Monday he found <ORGANIZATION> Davis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acquisition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s registration statement offering to purchase all of <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s outstanding shares deficient. <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> failed to disclose the manner in which he would operate <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> so as to expand its operation and not dispose of `` strategic'' assets of the company or lay off employees. Additionally, the commissioner said, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> did not disclose plans relating to an Airbus maintenance facility that he said he intended to locate in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> scheduled a hearing on the matter for this evening, and said the registration would be suspended Friday if the deficiencies are not corrected. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Fingeroth </PERSON>, a Davis spokesman, said the acquisition company had no comment on the order. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' attorneys, meanwhile, were shoring up their efforts in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> is incorporated. His lawyers argued in a <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, court against a provision in <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>'s `` poison pill'' takeover defense that is hindering his efforts to put a new <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> board of directors in place. The defense effectively would block a new board of directors from selling <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> for 180 days. The prospect of a long delay would discourage shareholders from supporting <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> in the proxy fight planned at <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>'s May 15 annual meeting, attorney <PERSON> Gilchrist </PERSON> <PERSON> Sparks </PERSON> told the hearing. <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothmeier </PERSON> has said he prefers to see the airline remain independent or find a `` white knight'' investor to work with current management. In letters to the 5,000 union pilots at <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Rothmeier </PERSON> said last week that `` there are alternatives available to us from friendly investors.'' But, he said, the assistance is contingent upon a contract settlement with the pilots, who have been working under two separate contracts since <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> acquired <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> in 1986. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> court action altered the course of his fight against the Northwest poison pill. He initially sought to invalidate the entire poison plan, which would more than double the cost of a potential acquisition by a hostile bidder by flooding the market with new <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> shares. But <PERSON> Sparks </PERSON> said Monday that <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> would like to retain the pill for his own use in the event he gained control of the board. <PERSON> Rothmeier </PERSON> has declined to identify any potential friendly investors, but the company has said a group holding 4.9 percent of <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>'s 29.1 million shares outstanding is interested in a leveraged buyout. In a leveraged buyout, a company is bought with largely borrowed funds. The group includes Los Angeles-based investor <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> and former <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> board member <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, now an executive for <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday that <ORGANIZATION> Kelso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a small investment bank based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, is considering a bid for the airline. Spokesman for <PERSON> Kelso </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> declined to comment.

<HEAD>Drexel, Rothschild Workers Sue Over Layoffs, Plans To Sell Brokerage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Laid-off workers at the Wall Street brokerage <ORGANIZATION> L.F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rothschild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> have sued their former employer under the new federal plant closing law, while three <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> employees have sued that investment house over its plans to sell its retail brokerage business. The Rothschild employees claim they were dismissed without the 60 days' notice required under the plant-closing law. A lawyer for the workers said Monday he did not know of any other suits filed under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, which took effect Feb. 4. The workers were laid off March 10. Though the act is known popularly as the plant closing law, it applies to any company with at least 100 employees in all and at least 50 at one site. Such firms must give workers 60 days' notice of a shutdown or mass layoffs. The lawyer, <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, said <PERSON> L.F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothschild </PERSON> laid off about 250 workers at its <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> headquarters without warning. The suit, seeking back pay and punitive damages, was filed Friday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> by seven former employees as a class action. The suit said <PERSON> Rothschild </PERSON> was one of the 20 largest brokerage houses in the nation, with more than $ 300 million in capital, before the October 1987 stock market crash. The firm suffered heavy losses in the crash and was purchased in June by a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Franklin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a savings and loan based in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kan </PERSON>. But it continued to lose money, and the layoffs ensued. In a letter announcing the layoffs, <PERSON> Rothschild </PERSON> told its employees the plant closing law did not apply because the company had been `` pursuing a realistic opportunity'' to have a lender bail it out and avert the layoffs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said the law did offer such an exemption, on grounds that a layoff notice would scare off potential lenders. But he said in this case the bailout apparently was being considered by <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, the parent company. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said that would not qualify for an exemption because <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> already was aware of <PERSON> Rothschild </PERSON>'s condition. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rothschild </PERSON>'s attorney, declined to discuss the case, saying the company would respond in court. He did say <PERSON> Rothschild </PERSON> gave severance pay to the workers. But <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said the law requires notification regardless. In the <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> case, the class-action suit filed Monday by the three workers charges <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s top managers with breach of contract and violations of their fiduciary duties because of the plans to sell the brokerage division. The suit, filed in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, contends that the sale of the unit will cost the brokers millions of dollars because they will be forced to sell their <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> stock for far below its true value. The price of the stock is based on book value. The suit did not disclose the firm's book value. According to the suit, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> has understated the book value of its assets, including warrants and options it has received in some deals in lieu of partial payment of fees. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Anreder </PERSON> said the firm had not studied the suit and had no comment. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> annouced plans last week for a major restructuring that involves the sale of the brokerage unit and the elimination of about one-third of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s work force. The restructuring was prompted in part by bad publicity due to the investigation of securities fraud at the investment house.

 The dollar rose in quiet early European trading today. Gold prices also were higher. Foreign currency dealers said they were waiting for the 8:30 a.m. EDT release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> durable goods orders for March. A rise of 1.5 percent or more could send the dollar higher, dealers said.

Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 131.35 yen. Dealers in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s announcement did not affect European exchange rates because the markets had been expecting it for a week. `` It's very quiet today,'' said <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Zapfel </PERSON>, a trader at <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. `` The dollar is n't doing very much ...

 The <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s key index rose sharply today, but the dollar fell against the yen after Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> announced he will resign as soon as <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> approves the fiscal 1989 budget. The dollar closed at 131.17 yen, down 0.21 yen from Monday's 131.38-yen finish It opened at 131.65 yen, its high for the day, and ranged as low as 131.05 yen. `` The dollar started higher following its weak note on overseas markets, where the yen was sold, but Japanese investors concertedly bought the -LRB- yen -RRB- following news about Mr. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s resignation,'' said an analyst with a commercial bank in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity Investors believed that <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s departure would eliminate some political and economic tensions, he said. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> has been linked with a company at the center of a stock-profiteering and bribery scandal, and opposition parties have been boycotting budget deliberations in Parliament to demand that the government clear up the situation. `` There has been speculation of some more arrests of politicians, but the majority expects that things would not worsen,'' the analyst added. Also encouraging yen-buying today were expectations that the Japanese central bank might raise its interest rate soon. Higher domestic interest rates, which would narrow the interest rate gap between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, would weaken dollar-buying incentives, traders said. Bank of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Satoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sumita </PERSON> told a meeting of branch chiefs today that the bank would take appropriate measures if prices become unstable. On the stock market, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues, which fell 223.89 points Monday, shot up 438.86 points, or 1.34 percent, closing at 33,244.78. The gain was the third-largest of the year. News reports early today that <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> might resign boosted buying, said <PERSON> Kenji </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishizuka </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. `` Since Mr. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> would not resign until the budget is approved, participants concertedly bought construction issues because the budget approval guarantees public construction,'' he added. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> announced his decision to resign following a Cabinet meeting. His popularity has been eroding steadily in the face of the stock-profiteering and bribery scandal and a new sales tax. Besides construction issues, steel shares attracted investors. Although share prices were higher across the board, trading was only moderate, with first section volume estimated at 800 million shares, up from Monday's 450 million. <PERSON> Ishizuka </PERSON> said some investors were concerned over domestic consumer price figures for March, due to be announced later this week.

<HEAD>A Glance At The Government-Toppling Recruit Scandal</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Japan-Politics Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Here is a glance at the Recruit scandal, which claimed its biggest victim today when Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> announced his intention to resign: THE ORIGIN: In late 1986 <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> offered bargain-priced shares in a real estate subsidiary to more than 150 leading politicians, bureaucrats, business leaders and media executives. The shares doubled in value after they went on public sale, yielding big profits to the holders who sold. Prosecutors, who have arrested 14 people, allege the transactions were bribes in which Recruit sought special favors from government bureaucrats in a position to influence or regulate Recruit's businesses in job-placement magazines or telecommunications. No politicians have been arrested. <PERSON> TAKESHITA </PERSON>'S LINK: Like most other politicians, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s name was not on share transactions, but an aide and a relative profited to a total of $ 192,000. The prime minister also acknowledged that he received more than $ 1 million in political donations and contributions to fund-raising parties from Recruit. He told Parliament the donations were legal and sought to put the matter behind him, but over the weekend he also said he received a loan of $ 381,700 from Recruit in 1987 and was embarrassed at having to change his story. ALSO LINKED: Former Prime Minister <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>, under whose administration the share transactions took place.

<TEXT>
 The high-profile Italian retailer <ORGANIZATION> Benetton </ORGANIZATION> has opened its first store in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, shocking shoppers accustomed to empty shelves with mounds of colorful clothing and prices in their own currency. Sales clerks reported the most common question was `` Dollars or zlotys?'' as a storefront on <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>'s main shopping street, <PERSON> Ulica </PERSON> <PERSON> Marszalkowska </PERSON>, on Monday turned into a glistening <ORGANIZATION> Benetton </ORGANIZATION> outlet with its crisp, modern look. The Italian retailer is on the leading edge of marketing by Western companies in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> has been trying to attract such businesses to help shore up its ailing economy. Stacks and stacks of knitwear in bright hues of orange, blue, and yellow were folded on open shelves in the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> store on Monday. A bevy of saleswomen in <ORGANIZATION> Benetton </ORGANIZATION> outfits volunteered assistance. In short, the new store at first looked and sounded very unlike a typically bare Polish store with its clerks' curt replies of `` <PERSON> Nie </PERSON> ma'' _ `` There is none.'' Within hours of opening, however, the store had acquired the customary line. `` The first day probably will be pretty violent, since it is something new,'' said saleswoman <PERSON> Elzbieta </PERSON> <PERSON> Makucz </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Benetton </ORGANIZATION> is the first Western clothing retailer to open an outlet selling for zlotys in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, which increasing has a two-currency economy but is plagued by a shortage of quality consumer goods. Many desirable goods, from cocoa to cars, are bought for dollars in special shops or by private arrangement. Many of <ORGANIZATION> Benetton </ORGANIZATION>'s first shoppers found the zloty prices astoundingly high. A hot pink sweatshirt was offered for 78,000 zlotys, about the average monthly salary. Last month, Poles became able to legally trade dollars for zlotys at about the same rate _ now 4,000 zlotys per dollar _ as on the black market. Thus, a Pole with $ 25, perhaps sent by a relative abroad, can turn it into 100,000 zlotys. In a 1988 report, the government estimated that $ 5 billion in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency was circulating in the country and another $ 2.8 billion was deposited in bank accounts. Many other hard currencies are, of course, also in circulation. In the joint venture with <ORGANIZATION> Benetton </ORGANIZATION>, the state-run fashion company <ORGANIZATION> Moda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polska </ORGANIZATION> is buying merchandise from the Italian retailer in hard currency and translating the prices to zlotys. `` I first of all want to be a businessman,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Moda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polska </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Marek </PERSON> <PERSON> Zembrzuski </PERSON>. He said <PERSON> Moda </PERSON> <PERSON> Polska </PERSON> spent about $ 400,000 for the first <ORGANIZATION> Benetton </ORGANIZATION> stock, out of about $ 5 million to be spent on imported goods this year. The hard currency is obtained through exports and auctions of hard currency, he said. For <ORGANIZATION> Benetton </ORGANIZATION>'s part, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> is one of a series of new markets explored by the company. There are nine <ORGANIZATION> Benettons </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, five in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and seven in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Renata </PERSON> <PERSON> Sponchiado </PERSON>, who represents management in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. However, the other East bloc <ORGANIZATION> Benettons </ORGANIZATION> do not accept local currency, <PERSON> Zembrzuski </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Benetton </ORGANIZATION> designed the store and trained the staff _ there is even a company style for folding clothes _ but <ORGANIZATION> Moda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polska </ORGANIZATION> operates it. `` Moda Polska and <ORGANIZATION> Benetton </ORGANIZATION> are two young companies, and this is a good starting point for us,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Villax </PERSON>, who set up the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> store for <ORGANIZATION> Benetton </ORGANIZATION>. She predicted other company outlets in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. One man, who was among the first shoppers, left Monday with two bulging trademark-green shopping bags and an enthusiastic review: `` It is a great idea. There is a much bigger choice.'' He said the prices seemed about the same as those in stores that accept dollars. However, some women peering at the display window had other ideas. `` The prices shock me,'' said one. `` It is not even worth looking,'' said another.

 The year is 2089 and fusion power plants are energizing the world, bringing the benefits of virtually unlimited electricity to countries everywhere. Earth's sky is crystalline blue, purged of the gases and gunk that soured the atmosphere above whole continents a century before when fossil fuels were the main energy of civilization. Concerns about the greenhouse effect and problems of acid rain are now only academic curiosities. An atmosphere once choked with the combustion gases of fossil fuels is slowly cleaning itself. And life is returning to lakes and streams that previously were acid-filled. Such is the world that scientists and engineers envision with the advent of fusion, the process by which atoms are fused together to release energy. Their visions are not just wishful thinking, but goals that must be achieved, according to some experts, because the age of fossil fuels is expected to start drawing to a close within only a few decades. And when fossil fuels are gone or become impractically expensive, something must be ready to take their place. `` The most likely thing will be fusion,'' said <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Furth </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> plasma physics laboratory. `` The present projections are that by the year 2040 or 2050, there will be a divergence between the energy required for a growing population and the energy available from fossil fuels, easily obtainable uranium and other sources. `` There will be quite a calamity unless something new is ready,'' he added. The `` cold fusion'' process announced last month by the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> is still controversial and unproven. But <PERSON> Furth </PERSON> and others believe a fusion process based on compressing deuterium plasma and heating it to 100 million degrees can be developed within two decades or less. Thousands of researchers working at both federal and university laboratories are moving closer and closer to the point where the fusion fires will ignite and burn, powered by deuterium or hydrogen, chemicals easily extracted from seawater. Most experts believe the fusion future lies with the high-pressure `` hot'' process, but they would welcome convincing proof that <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>'s cold, room-temperature fusion works because it possibly could be developed more quickly. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Storm </PERSON>, a fusion research project leader at the <ORGANIZATION> Lawrence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Livermore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, said that researchers could have a fusion-fired power plant operating by the year 2020 if the industrial nations of the world would commit the resources. `` Fusion is the energy source that nature prefers. It's the one that drives the sun and the stars,'' said Storm. `` And nature is efficient.'' `` We could have fusion in just 15 years or so,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Fusion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit education foundation, `` but the government has n't put a high priority on it so it will take 30 years or more.'' <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> said an investment by the federal government of $ 1 billion a year for 15 years would bring fusion power to reality, but he said that is n't likely to happen `` until there's an economic incentive.'' Most experts believe there will be a slow phase-out of fossil fuels as they become more expensive, and that the 21st century eventually evolve into an all-fusion civilization. Some of the fusion of that era will be from manmade plants on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. But the experts also believe there will be a more efficient use of solar radiation, the energy created by the natural fusion process of the sun. Once that time comes, according to scientists' visions, oil spills will be obscure footnotes in history texts or just quaint memories recalled by centenarians who lounge in the bright sunlight of a pollution-free sky. Petroleum, expensive and becoming rare, will seldom be used for fuel, and coal even less often. A fusion-driven world could have automobiles and trucks running on nearly silent electric engines, leaving in their wake only eddies of clean air _ not the rank clouds that trailed vehicles of an earlier, gasoline-burning age. Some engines could operate on hydrogen, a fuel extracted from seawater by the use of the plentiful electric power. In this scenario, fusion power plants, easily licensed and fueled by a chemical extracted from seawater, would dot the landscape on continents around the globe. The plants would not pose the radiation hazard that once seemed so threatening from nuclear fission plants of the late 20th century. There would be no Chernobyl-like monster straining to break free with fusion. Radiation waste from fusion would be only a fraction of that from fission plants. Fusion wastes are rendered harmless within decades, while the century-old spent fuel rods from the 1989 nuclear fission power plants would still be deadly and would be for another 1,000 years. `` Whatever process is developed, fusion is inevitable,'' said Storm, the fusion researcher. `` It's not a question of if, but of when.''

<HEAD>Clothing Retailer To Sell Larger-Sizes Discount Chain</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Women's clothing retailer <ORGANIZATION> Limited </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is selling its larger-sizes discount chain <ORGANIZATION> Lerner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Woman </ORGANIZATION>, freeing up the company to concentrate on its higher priced specialty apparel outlets. <PERSON> Lerner </PERSON> <PERSON> Woman </PERSON>, created in 1986 as an offshoot of <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>, will be sold for an undisclosed price to a management group led by the division's president, company spokesman <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Dietzel </PERSON> said Monday. <PERSON> Dietzel </PERSON> said the selling price, in cash and securities, was expected to approximate the book value of <ORGANIZATION> Lerner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Woman </ORGANIZATION>'s assets. The deal is expected to be completed in June, the company said. <PERSON> Lerner </PERSON> <PERSON> Woman </PERSON>, which merged with discount chain Sizes Unlimited in 1987, operates under the store names Lerner Woman, Sizes Unlimited, Smart Sizes and Sizes Woman. Aimed mostly at discount shoppers seeking larger sizes, the 382-store chain had sales of $ 223.7 million in 1988. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trott </PERSON>, a retail analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said Monday the deal meant Limited would continue to provide the <LOCATION> Rochelle </LOCATION>, N.J.-based Lerner Woman with computer and distribution services and management information, for a fee. `` They do n't lose any earnings, and yet through the sale of this they free up some of their assets,'' <PERSON> Trott </PERSON> said. `` It's a fair deal all the way around.'' Columbus-based Limited, with $ 4 billion in sales last year, operates more than 3,400 apparel stores nationwide, including <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Limited </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Limited </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ambercrombie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Fitch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION>'s Secret and <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendel </PERSON> Most of the stores _ with the exception of <LOCATION> Lerner </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Woman </LOCATION> _ are full-price outlets that tend to be located in regional shopping malls, while <ORGANIZATION> Lerner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Woman </ORGANIZATION> stores generally are located in smaller shopping strips. `` Lerner Woman just had never worked,'' said retail analyst <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Wintzer </PERSON> of <PERSON> Alex </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. `` They've got to find a niche, a customer that is n't being serviced by other chains. `` The top management at The Limited just did n't have the time to concentrate on that division,'' <PERSON> Wintzer </PERSON> said. Limited acquired the Sizes Unlimited chain in 1982 and <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> in 1986, said a woman at Limited headquarters who declined to give her name. Equity of the new corporation initially will be shared equally by <PERSON> Lerner </PERSON> <PERSON> Woman </PERSON>'s management, led by president <PERSON> Raphael </PERSON> <PERSON> Benaroya </PERSON>, The Limited and <ORGANIZATION> Centre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION>, the company said in a statement.

<HEAD>Dallas On `Short List' For Sears Relocation, Sources Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest retailer, has narrowed possible relocation sites of its merchandising group to three or four cities, including <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, sources say. The sources said Monday that the Chicago-based retailer now has a `` short list'' of possible sites, but said <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, has emerged as the leading contender. It could not be immediately determined what other cities were still under consideration, the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> reported today. Sources told the newspaper that <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> officials are expected to visit <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> within the next two weeks to look at the area and meet with economic development officials. `` All of us are operating on feelings, but we believe that we are definitely on the list,'' said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Eubanks </PERSON>, who heads <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partnership </ORGANIZATION>, an economic development agency. `` The big unknown is <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, and I do n't want to sell them short.'' Chicago-area officials have been working to keep <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> in the city where it grew up since the company announced in October it wanted to build a campus-style headquarters complex for its merchandising group. That division now has headquarters in the 110-story Sears Tower in downtown <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. At the time, the company said it would look at other cities but preferred to stay in the area. Though Sears is selling the 15-year-old tower, the company has said its corporate headquarters will remain there after the merchandise group is gone. Even so, the move would involve 6,700 of the group's 8,000 employees. <PERSON> Eubanks </PERSON> said he expects the company to make a decision within the next few weeks. `` I think it's real close,'' he said. A <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said the company has not set a deadline for its decision and that she could not comment on the relocation. Other cities under consideration, sources say, include <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. Economic development officials in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> would not comment Monday on <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>. `` I've got nothing to say,'' said <PERSON> Alvah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, director of business and industry development for the state's <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> has attracted <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, to relocate its consolidated Telephone Operation to <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Colinas </LOCATION> in suburban <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> and <PERSON> J.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Penney </PERSON>, the nation's fourth-largest retailer, to move from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to suburban <LOCATION> Plano </LOCATION>. The GTE relocation means 1,000 new jobs in the area and the <PERSON> Penney </PERSON> is bringing another 3,000 jobs. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' merchandise group, which oversees the retailer's stores and catalog operations, accounts for more than half of the company's size. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> also owns <ORGANIZATION> Allstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Coldwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Real </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estate </ORGANIZATION>, none of which is being relocated.

 Linked to an influence-peddling scandal and immensely unpopular, Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> announced his resignation today but left his successor and the timing of his departure unclear. The Recruit scandal has bedeviled Japanese politics for half of <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s 18-month tenure, and it appeared possible an elder politician might become interim prime minister until the situation is sorted out. The candidate mentioned in many news reports was former Foreign Minister <PERSON> Masayoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ito </PERSON>, an elder statesman untouched by the Recruit scandal. But his health was in question _ he is a diabetic. `` I think it should be a young person. It's time for a young person to be in charge,'' said <PERSON> Ito </PERSON>, 75-year-old chairman of the executive council of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Other powerful figures in the party that has governed <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> since 1955 are as tainted by money from the <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> as <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, including his rival and party secretary general, former Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shintaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Abe </PERSON>. `` The Recruit question has caused a grave crisis for the nation's parliamentary democracy,'' <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, 65, said in a nationwide television broadcast after telling the Cabinet of his intention to resign. `` I have decided to pull out in order to retrieve the public's trust in politics,'' he said `` As the chief executive of government and president of the ruling party, I deeply apologize.'' Asked about the succession, he declined to comment, saying `` it is not the place of one resigning to express such opinions.'' Once <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> resigns, governing party members would choose their next party president, who would become prime minister due to the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>' majority in both houses of parliament. His resignation would also mean his entire Cabinet would leave office. The party leadership also would be expected to resign, news reports said. Prices on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> surged after the announcement. The Nikkei Stock Average rose 1.34 percent, the year's third largest one-day gain. Newspapers rushed out single-sheet extra editions with the news. The tabloid <PERSON> Fuji </PERSON> daily headlined `` Takeshita Finally Resigns.'' Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said today the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration would work with <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s eventual successor. `` It's a democracy and whoever the leader of that democracy is, we'll work with,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said during a stop in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> en route to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Samoa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s approval rating in a recent poll by <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> slumped to 3.9 percent, making him <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s most unpopular postwar prime minister. In addition to the scandal, he was hurt by the introduction April 1 of an unpopular 3 percent sales tax. And rural voters _ a bastion of <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> strength _ were disaffected by moves to liberalize agricultural imports. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said he would leave office after parliament passes the 1989 budget. But parliament, or the Diet, has been stalled by a boycott by opposition parties demanding that former Prime Minister <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> testify about the Recruit scandal. There was a hint of progress on the issue this evening as the governing party said the opposition had agreed to participate in Budget Committee sessions. But the opposition still insisted on a promise that <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> would testify. The Liberal Democrats have more than enough votes to ram the budget through, but doing so would go against the Japanese tradition of politics by consensus. <PERSON> Takako </PERSON> <PERSON> Doi </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the largest opposition group, said she wants new general elections and <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>'s testimony. `` I think it is nonsense to ask for the passage of the budget in exchange for his -LRB- <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s -RRB- resignation,'' she said. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said he would go ahead with a nine-day trip to five Southeast Asian nations starting Saturday, indicating he hopes the Diet will pass the budget in early May. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> had been clinging to office with a pledge to reform politics and reclaim public trust in politicians. Recently, however, he acknowledged he received even more money from the <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> than the more than $ 1 million in what he called legal political donations that he earlier this month admitted getting. During the weekend it was reported <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> he also received a loan of $ 381,700 from the information-publishing giant in 1987. Admitting the reports were true further embarrassed <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>. The Recruit scandal broke last summer with revelations that the company had sold cut-price shares in a real estate subsidiary to more than 150 politicians, bureaucrats, business leaders and media executives. The shares, often bought with money lent by another Recruit subsidiary, yielded fat profits when sold after the subsidiary went public in 1986. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, through an aide and a relative who actually held the shares, benefited to the tune of $ 192,000. <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>'s aides similarly raked in about $ 460,000. Three Cabinet ministers had resigned previously because of links to Recruit. Prosecutors have so far arrested 14 people _ but no politicians _ in the case, charging them with bribery and securities law violations. It is alleged that Recruit sought favors from bureaucrats who regulated its main business in job-placement magazines and from top executives of companies with which it did business, including <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Although <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has been known for money politics since the end of the war, the public was shocked by the amounts of money involved and the broad spectrum of the establishment that was tainted. The Recruit scandal has caused the greatest political fallout in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> since former Prime Minister <PERSON> Kakuei </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanaka </PERSON> was accused in the Lockheed affair in 1976. He was convicted of taking a $ 2 million bribe after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aircraft company admitted it spent $ 12.1 million to advance its sales in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.

 The cost of wages, salaries and benefits to the nation's employers rose 1.2 percent in the first quarter of 1989, with increases in benefits costs again outpacing pay gains, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported today. The Employment Cost Index report showed that for the 12 months ended March 31 the cost of wages, salaries and benefits rose 4.8 percent, down slightly from the 5 percent average for calendar 1988 but up significantly from the 1987 jump of 3.6 percent. The index measures changes in an employers' costs for all forms of compensation, principally wages and salaries and employer-paid benefits such as health insurance. It is closely watched as a barometer of inflation, particularly in the past year as analysts have speculated that the tight labor market would drive up compensation costs because of increased competition for workers. Analysts disagreed over whether the figures signaled a faster pace of wage gains and therefore increased inflationary pressure on the economy. `` The numbers are reasonably favorable and there are no signs of wage acceleration,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, president of a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> economic forecasting firm. `` Except for the one sore spot of rising health care costs ... I think the figures show wage gains continue to be stable and no signs of rapid acceleration.'' But economist <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinner </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, said the report indicated labor costs are `` creeping up.'' He predicted the annual rate of employer cost increases, which would be 4.5 percent if the first-quarter numbers held throughout the year, would climb to 5 percent and possibly to 5.5 percent over the next year. `` With unemployment down to almost 5 percent, workers feel that they can ask for their normal share _ which is the sum of inflation and productivity,'' <PERSON> Brinner </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. Inflation on U.S.-produced goods is about 4.5 percent and productivity gains have been in the 1 percent to 1.5 percent range. The rate of employer costs could slow, however, if unemployment rises. <PERSON> Brinner </PERSON> predicted that the civilian jobless rate, 5.0 percent last month, would edge up in the next quarter and reach 5.5 percent or slightly higher by year's end. The 1.2 percent increase in the index for the first quarter compared with 1.0 percent in the final quarter of 1988 and 1.4 percent from the first quarter of last year, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported. The increase for the first three months of 1989 was attributed to a 1.1 percent jump in wage and salary costs and a 1.8 percent rise in employers' costs for benefits. Escalating health care costs have been the largest factor in the rising costs of benefits. For the year ended March 31, the government said wages and salaries for workers in private industry rose 4.2 percent while the cost of benefits rose 5.1 percent. Employer costs for workers in service industries rose 1.5 percent in the first quarter, up from 1.2 percent in the final three months of 1988 and the 1.3 percent gain reported in the first quarter of 1988. In the goods-producing industries, employer costs rose 1.0 percent for the quarter, up from 0.8 percent in the final quarter of 1988 but down from the 1.8 percent jump reported for the first quarter of last year.

 Today brings another critical test for the auto industry _ the first full sales period of the latest round of incentives _ and carmakers are looking for the consumer response that so far has eluded them. `` I'm holding my breath a little on this one,'' auto analyst <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laughlin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. Sales during March were lower than expected, prompting <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to institute new, expensive incentive programs. Partially because of those enticements, car and light truck sales during early April were 28.3 percent higher than the same period last year. But sales during the first 10 days of April last year were among the lowest of the year, distorting comparisons with this year's performance Sales rebounded in mid-April 1988, meaning today's year-to-year comparisons will give a better snapshot of how sales are faring compared to the same time in the second-best sales year in industry history. Automakers had counted on strong March and April sales to shrink inventories and put off the need for large-scale production cutbacks. `` I guess you'd say they -LRB- incentives -RRB- are working but not as well as they used to,'' analyst <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Healy </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. `` If that's so, mid-April sales were better than the March rate but not as good as early April.'' <PERSON> Laughlin </PERSON> said he was watching interest rates particularly closely. `` If interest rates start to trend down, I think that would alleviate some of the concern -LRB- among automakers -RRB- about the impact of this particular -LRB- incentive -RRB- program, `` he said. `` It would suggest that things will be easier in the next few months. `` If interest rates hang up here, it may be a source of concern for the industry.'' One of the first places any industry concern would be noted is in the companies' production schedules. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> held to ambitious production levels through the first quarter of this year, leading some analysts to speculate that production rates would have to be changed later this year, especially at model-changeover time in the third quarter. Today, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> analyst <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Windecker </PERSON> said the nation's No. 2 automaker was cutting about 2 percent from its second-quarter production schedule as part of `` fine tuning.'' `` Our market share continues to move up, but we will cheerfully admit the industry is a little softer than we thought it would be,'' he said. The cuts, <PERSON> Windecker </PERSON> added, would come in overtime <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> has been running at all but one of its 18 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Canadian assembly plants. The company's <LOCATION> Oakville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, plant, which makes the Ford Tempo and Mercury Topaz, is operating on straight time. <PERSON> Windecker </PERSON> said third-quarter production schedules are due out later. Meantime, <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>'s Automotive Reports, a weekly industry newsletter, said in Monday editions that <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> had cut its production schedule by 60,000 cars for the third quarter of 1989. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Pyden </PERSON> refused to comment on the report, saying final production figures for the July-September period are n't set. However, he confirmed the nation's largest carmaker had cut its second-quarter production schedule by about 3 percent. `` The vast majority of it is elimination of some of our planned overtime,'' he said. `` This does not change our yearlong sales forecast for 1989. We will approach 15 million units.'' <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s original production schedule for mid-1989 was scaled back from first-quarter levels.

<HEAD>Bush Renews Plea for Cut in Capital Gains Tax</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today that critics `` could n't be more wrong'' when they call his proposed cut in capital gains taxes `` a tax break for the rich.'' Rather, he said, that proposal and other new investment incentives are needed to help <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> compete in the global economy. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took note of the criticism of his proposal in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and elsewhere in a speech prepared for managers and employees at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION>'s Space Systems Division here. `` Well, they could n't be more wrong,'' he said. `` Lower capital gains taxes will create jobs for those who do n't have jobs, and help build a better <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' Capital gains taxes are levied on the profits that businesses and individuals make on investments. The president wants to cut the 33 percent maximum tax on capital gains to 15 percent and to exempt entirely the gains accrued by people with incomes under $ 10,000 a year. When fully effective in 1995, the tax break for capital gains would apply to assets held for 36 months or longer. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, and other top congressional Democrats have criticized <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for pushing the capital-gains reduction, which they term `` a tax break for the rich,'' while opposing legislation to increase the minimum wage to $ 4.55 an hour from the current $ 3.35. In his Palo Alto speech, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also put in a fresh plug for his proposed tax credit aimed at making child care more affordable for the poor. This came a day after it was disclosed that he had come out against a reduction in the surtax paid by older Americans for <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> coverage of catastrophic illiness. The president noted that demographic changes in the American labor force indicate that the majority of new job-seekers in the years ahead will be females, minorities and immigrants. To keep abreast of the rapidly changing technologies and the change in the labor markets, he said, businesses must have incentives to make the kinds of investments that will create new jobs _ and he suggested that many of these new jobs will come in the high-technology area. `` Lower capital gains taxes will create jobs for those who do n't have jobs, and help build a better <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' he said `` So let us act to lift revenue, help savings, and free American businesses, without distorting world markets.'' `` My friends, I want to give the high five to high-tech. And I want to do it by investing in competitiveness,'' he said. The president was coupling his <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> economic speech today with a pep talk downstate to officers at a narcotics-enforcement training institute in Rancho del Rio. The disparate themes of the four-day <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> trip, which will conclude Thursday in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, seemed aimed at projecting an active president in the final seven days of the first 100 _ a milestone that has been used to report first impressions of the president's stewardship of national affairs <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has sought to minimize the importance of the 100-day marker for presidential performance. But during a speech Monday to the annual luncheon of <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> newspaper publishers in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, he went ahead anyway. `` We've made a good start these first three months,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` So while I'm pleased with all we've accomplished in these three months, there's a long road ahead of us.'' Meanwhile, in a letter made public Monday, the president came out against any quick moves to reduce the surtax for <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> coverage of catastrophic illness. In the letter, released by Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ill </LOCATION>., <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said it would be `` imprudent to tinker'' with the program even in light of a congressionally projected surplus in its reserves Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, last week raised the possibility of a reduction of up to 16 percent in the surtax. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, however, said in the letter that financial reserves for the program `` are not excessive'' and may actually be `` too thin.'' He said the surplus projections are based on uncertainties in a program that is only a few months old. The president set aside the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> plant speech today to laud the more than 75-month recovery from the 1981-82 recession and the nation's 5 percent unemployment rate, which is at the lowest level in 15 years. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also wanted to warn anew of an <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that is declining competitively in the global economy. The merchandise trade deficit fell from $ 152.1 billion in 1987 to $ 118.7 billion last year _ a 22 percent reduction which represented the first annual improvement since 1980. But the deficit has been on an upward trend more recently, with the red-ink figure at $ 10.5 billion in February, which was more than 20 percent above the January figure. `` We had a tremendous improvement in the trade figure last year, but we're now seeing a pause,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON>, chairman of the president's <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION>. `` When you go through a very substantial growth in exports, as we did last year, you often see such a pause and an adjustment.'' Speaking to reporters en route here on Air Force One, <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON> said that many businesses and industries are still trying to build up to capacity production. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will travel to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> on Wednesday to be reunited with the president he served as vice president for eight years, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Later in the week, the president will address the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> and make drug-related appearances in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Clearwater </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, before returning to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> late Thursday.

 High school students walked out of class and rallied today in support of miners on strike against <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a day after the walkout turned nasty with the arrests of at least 200 miners. Seven striking members of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> said they were injured in Monday's arrests. Many strikers accused <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> state troopers of being unnecessarily rough. Most of the town's businesses closed for Monday's daylong rally in support of the strike, now in its 20th day. `` It's not criminal to stand up for what you believe in,'' <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, executive assistant to the union vice president, told about 300 people at the rally in this western <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> town of about 1,400 people. `` There's going to be a lot more people in jail because it ai n't over.'' State Police Sgt. B.I. <PERSON> Sparks </PERSON> said about 200 miners and their supporters were arrested and charged with obstructing a free passage, Route 773, and were being released on their recognizance. Union members estimated the number arrested at closer to 300. An exact count was not immediately available because the numbers overwhelmed local officials, forcing them to turn a courtroom into an impromptu holding cell. `` There's not enough cells to hold us,'' <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> said. The 1,400 <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> employees in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and 300 in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> went on strike April 5, accusing the company of unfair practices during contract talks. The miners had been working without a contract since February 1988. About 200 union members gathered today at the <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> mine but did not block the road or mine entrances. No one was arrested. However, `` I think all of them here were prepared to go to jail if necessary,'' <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> 28 President <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Stump </PERSON> said today. Also, about 150 <ORGANIZATION> Clintwood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> students walked out of class today and rallied at the <ORGANIZATION> Dickenson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Courthouse </ORGANIZATION> in support of the miners, officials said. `` They're sort of walking around in the street in front of the courthouse,'' waving signs and chanting, said deputy county clerk <PERSON> Lula </PERSON> <PERSON> Large </PERSON>. She said a single police officer watched the students for a while, then left. `` The principal came down and talked to the children and asked them to go back to class,'' but the students refused, Large said. A secretary at <PERSON> Clintwood </PERSON> <PERSON> High </PERSON> said she was instructed to tell callers that school officials had no comment. Monday's arrests capped a day of civil disobedience by the union, which used more than 1,000 members to block entrances to <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>'s Moss No. 3 preparation plant and 200 others to block the <LOCATION> Lambert </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fork </LOCATION> mine, both in <LOCATION> Russell </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, in addition to the <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> mine. Also Monday, the union expanded its strike against <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> to temporarily include <ORGANIZATION> Westmoreland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which it accused of plotting to provide <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> with 200,000 to 300,000 tons of coal to fulfill contracts. <PERSON> Westmoreland </PERSON> has denied that charge. The <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> employees on strike in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> were joined on the picket lines by about 750 <LOCATION> Westmoreland </LOCATION> employees who are taking off three of the 10 `` memorial days'' _ or personal days _ allowed by their contract. State police treatment of those arrested infuriated some union members and supporters, some of whom displayed signs that said `` Welcome To <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'' and `` Cut State Police Pay and Benefits.'' <PERSON> Sparks </PERSON> said he was aware of some reports of injuries. `` They were just complaints of injuries,'' he said. `` We do n't know whether there were actually injuries.'' Six miners who said they received cuts and bruises while being arrested were treated and released at <ORGANIZATION> Dickenson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Clintwood </LOCATION>. A seventh was admitted with reports of blurred vision, and was held for observation. <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Odom </PERSON> and company spokeswoman <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON> did not return phone calls from The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Monday.

<HEAD>Court Rules States May Tax for Oil and Gas Taken from Indian Reservations</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled today that states may tax companies for oil and gas taken from Indian reservations. Voting 6-3, the justices handed Western states an important victory in upholding a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> tax on oil and gas taken from the Jicarilla Apache reservation there. The court said the state levy does not trample on Indian rights and is not unfair to a petroleum company _ even though the company must pay taxes to the state and the tribe. The court rejected arguments that the state tax interferes with tribal economic development by prompting producers to look off Indian reservations for mineral deposits. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> officials told the court the dispute is of great concern in the West. They said there are more than 150 cases of companies with deposits on Indian land protesting such double taxation in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. Justice <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, writing for the court, said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has not specifically pre-empted the power of states to tax oil and gas on Indian lands. `` Any impairment to the federal policy favoring the exploitation of on-reservation oil and gas resources by <PERSON> Indian </PERSON> tribes ... is simply too indirect and too insubstantial to support'' a claim the state tax is pre-empted, <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> rejected arguments by <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which has a lease with the Apaches for oil and gas on the reservation, that it is subject to unfair double taxation. `` It is, of course, true that the total taxes paid by Cotton are higher than those paid by off-reservation producers,'' he said. `` But neither the state nor the tribe imposes a discriminatory tax. The burdensome consequence is entirely attributable to the fact that the leases are located in an area where two governmental entities share jurisdiction.'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> also noted that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> provides services to Cotton Petroleum on the reservation. There is no constitutional requirement that the services the company receives be equal in value to the amount of taxes it pays, <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> added. The Constitution does not demand that `` benefits received from a tax authority by an ordinary commercial taxpayer ... must equal the amount of its tax obligations,'' he said. Finally, <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> rejected an assertion that the Apache tribe is a `` state'' and therefore <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> is subject to multiple state taxation. In a dissenting opinion, Justice <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> said <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is increasing its revenue `` at the expense of tribal economic development.'' That violates federal policy, expressed in laws and regulations, to protect Indian self-determination, he said. He was joined by Justices <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>. Cotton Petroleum challenged taxes on oil and gas taken from some 15,000 acres of land on the Jicarilla Apache reservation. The company pays taxes to the tribe amounting to about 6 percent of its prpoduction, and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> levies five taxes on the company amounting to 8 percent of its production. Cotton Petroleum noted that oil and gas producers in the state with deposits taken from non-Indian land only pay 8 percent in royalties. The company said it paid $ 2.3 million in taxes to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> from 1981 through 1985 but received only $ 89,000 in services from the state. Today's ruling upholds a 1987 decision by the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. The Jicarilla tribe was not a direct participant in the case. It filed a so-called friend-of-the-court brief expressing its opposition to the state tax. In other action, the court: _ Upheld a 1986 federal law imposing `` safety user fees'' on pipeline companies that transport natural gas and hazardous liquids. The court reversed the ruling of a federal magistrate in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> that the law, which allows the secretary of transportation to impose user fees to pay for pipeline safety programs, unconstitutionally gives the executive branch too much of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' power to impose taxes _ Tossed out a dispute over the federal government's power to ban newspapers from publishing lists of winners in privately run lotteries. The justices ruled 6-3 that a controversy from <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> has become moot because the government no longer intends to enforce the ban. The Indian reservations case is Cotton Petroleum vs. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, 87-1327.

<HEAD>Britain's Ranks Hovis Launches Bid For Australian Food Firm</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Ranks <PERSON> Hovis </PERSON> <PERSON> McDougall </PERSON> PLC has made a takeover bid of about 1.4 billion pounds for <ORGANIZATION> Goodman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fielder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wattie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, the Australian food concern that failed in its hostile attempt to acquire Ranks <PERSON> Hovis </PERSON> last year. Turning the tables on the Sydney-based company, the British food group emphasized Monday its bid did not stem from last year's takeover battle or from fears it might be revived Ranks <PERSON> Hovis </PERSON> characterized its proposal, which values the Australian company at the equivalent of about $ 2.4 billion, as part of its own plan to expand internationally. <ORGANIZATION> Goodman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fielder </ORGANIZATION> is the largest food company in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Goodman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fielder </ORGANIZATION> said it was n't informed of the takeover bid in advance and advised shareholders to keep their shares while its directors examine Ranks <PERSON> Hovis </PERSON>' proposal. There was mixed speculation on what <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> Fielder would do. Several analysts said they consider Ranks <PERSON> Hovis </PERSON>' offer fair and one analyst speculated that <ORGANIZATION> Goodman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fielder </ORGANIZATION> would welcome it. <ORGANIZATION> Goodman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fielder </ORGANIZATION>'s corporate affairs director, <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, said `` Clearly there are synergies between the two companies.'' This same point was made last year by the Australian company when it was pursuing Ranks <PERSON> Hovis </PERSON>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Elston </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> Fielder could block the British bid if it chose to because a large portion of its shareholders are loyal to current management. `` In practical terms, you either have an agreed deal or you do n't have a deal at all,'' <PERSON> Elston </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> <PERSON> Fielder </PERSON>'s attempted takeover of Ranks <PERSON> Hovis </PERSON> last year was thwarted by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Monopolies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mergers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> because of its dependence on debt and on possible anti-competitive grounds. The attempt left <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> Fielder with 29.9 percent of Ranks <PERSON> Hovis </PERSON>' shares. A Goodman Fielder official said the company has held discussions with several interested parties about selling the stake but the talks are on hold while <ORGANIZATION> Goodman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fielder </ORGANIZATION> considers the Ranks <PERSON> Hovis </PERSON> proposal. Ranks <PERSON> Hovis </PERSON> said its bid is contingent upon acquiring more than 50 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Goodman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fielder </ORGANIZATION>'s common stock. The British company also said its offer carries a condition that <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> Fielder not enter into any new financial obligations exceeding a certain monetary threshold. The transaction would have to be endorsed by Ranks <PERSON> Hovis </PERSON> shareholders and would be subject to review by government regulators. Ranks <PERSON> Hovis </PERSON> said it did not anticipate any problems with Australian authorities. Besides <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, Ranks <PERSON> Hovis </PERSON> has interests in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It makes bread, flour, cakes and a wide range of other food products. <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> Fielder holds about 35 percent of the Australian flour-milling market and has a 50 percent share of that market in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>. It controls 60 percent of the Australian margirine and cooking oil market is the third largest gelatin maker in the world. It also owns <ORGANIZATION> Meneba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NV </ORGANIZATION>, a Dutch flour, bakery and poultry company.

 <ORGANIZATION> Goldome </ORGANIZATION> bank, one of the nation's leading thrifts, reported a loss of $ 38.8 million, or $ 1.41 per share, for its first quarter ending March 31, company officials said today. <ORGANIZATION> Goldome </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 12 million or 45 cents per share during the same period last year. Chief Executive Officer <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenzie </PERSON> told shareholders at the company's annual meeting in <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> that the loss _ which follows a loss of $ 119 million in 1988 _ was due to continued high interest rates and a decrease in income from non-banking subsidiaries. <PERSON> Kenzie </PERSON>, who is retiring this summer, said the company would continue restructuring efforts under the leadership of <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, the former head of the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> who was recently named his successor. `` I have no doubt this company will triumph in the 1990s,'' <PERSON> Kenzie </PERSON> said before turning the meeting over to <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Goldome </ORGANIZATION>, with assets of $ 14.5 billion, has operations in two dozen states.

 <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oats </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> today reported a 9.2 percent drop in its third-quarter earnings, citing an extraordinary expense of $ 20.7 million stemming from the consolidation of its European food-manufacturing operations. <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION> reported net income of $ 68.1 million, or 85 cents a share, for the three months ending March 31, compared with $ 75 million, or 94 cents a share, for the same period in 1988. Revenues for the quarter totaled $ 1.38 billion, a 3 percent gain from last year's sales of $ 1.34 billion, the Chicago-based company said in a news release. Excluding the one-time charge of $ 20.7 million, operating income would have been $ 158.4 million, 5 percent above a year ago, the company said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday reported a $ 4 million loss in the first quarter due in part to higher supply costs, but the maker of televisions and computers said it still expects to turn a profit this year. The net loss of $ 4 million, a deficit of 15 cents a share, for the three months ending April 1 compares with net income of $ 400,000, or 1 cent a share, for the same period in 1988. First-quarter sales totaled $ 674.5 million, a 17 percent gain from $ 574.1 million in the first quarter of 1988, <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> said in a news release from its headquarters in this north <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb. `` Our first-quarter loss was anticipated in our 1989 plan; we still expect profit improvement for the full year,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearlman </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>, the only major U.S.-based television manufacturer, recorded its first annual profit in four years in 1988, mainly as a result of booming computer sales. Sales of <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> computer systems and components rose 15 percent in the first quarter, to $ 402 million, but the group's operating income declined due to higher prices for memory chips, lower sales of power supplies and a $ 3 million loss in foreign exchange. Memory-chip costs are expected to drop significantly and sales of power supplies are expected to double in the second quarter, <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> said. Sales of <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> picture tubes, televisions and video-cassette recorders rose 21 percent, to $ 272 million, in the first quarter. The consumer electronics group's operating income also improved, <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> said, although television price tags industrywide were below year-ago levels. <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> said it put through modest price increases for its consumer electronics products early in the first quarter, and those increases have been holding.

 Sales of cars and light trucks made by the nation's Big Three automakers rose 4.7 percent in mid-April compared with last year, mainly because of a strong performance by <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the companies said Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported their vehicles sold at an average daily rate of 38,686 during the April 11-20 period this year, compared with a rate of 36,956 cars and trucks a day during the same time last year. Car sales rose a modest 2.1 percent and truck sales were up 9.3 percent during the period, in which each of the Big Three had new incentive packages in full force. The companies have been banking that incentives announced at the end of March and in early April would entice customers into showrooms and help pull the industry out of a lower-than-expected sales slump during the first three months of the year. Normally, March and April sales are robust, but they failed to live up to that billing last month, hence the incentives. For the first 20 days of April, Big Three car sales were up 12.1 percent and truck sales were running 15.6 percent ahead of last year's pace. Since Jan. 1, car sales by the Big Three were down 8.4 percent and truck sales were off 1.2 percent compared with last year. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said its mid-April car sales were running 14.5 percent ahead of last year's pace, going to a daily rate of 8,348 this year from 7,292 during the period last year. So far in 1989, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s car sales were running 1.1 percent ahead of last year's pace. Truck sales by <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> were up 4.9 percent during the 10-day period this year, and were down 2.4 percent for the calendar year. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> reported a 1.5 percent decrease in its mid-April car sales, with a daily rate of 12,296 this year, compared with 12,483 last year. So far this year, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> has sold 11 percent fewer cars than last year. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s light truck sales were up 14.7 percent in mid-April and down 2.4 percent so far this year. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> said its average daily car sales rate fell to 3,374 during mid-April this year, a 10.3 percent decline from the 3,760 rate during the period last year. Car sales by the nation's No. 3 automaker for the year were running 18.2 percent behind last year's pace Truck sales by Chrysler during the period were 7.1 percent above the mid-April pace last year, and for the entire year were 2.6 percent ahead of last year.

 Orders to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories for `` big ticket'' durable goods posted a moderate gain in March, the government reported Tuesday, but analysts said the increase reflected a surge in aircraft orders that masked a broader slowdown in the economy. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said total orders for durable goods rose 0.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted $ 124.9 billion last month, with virtually all of the increase attributed to a jump in demand for transportation equipment. Excluding the transportation category, which is subject to wide swings depending on when big contracts are signed, orders were down 2.8 percent in March, the third straight monthly decline. Analysts said the figures were consistent with recent government reports which suggest that economic growth is slowing as the record peacetime expansion extends into its seventh year. `` This definitely should tell even the biggest skeptic that the slowdown's arrived,'' <PERSON> Maury </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said of the latest report. `` Anybody who says monetary policy has n't affected the economy is just crazy.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> for a year has been pushing up interest rates in an effort to slow the economy and thus restrain inflation, although some analysts have expressed concern that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s actions could unintentionally topple the country into a recession. Economist <PERSON> Priscilla </PERSON> <PERSON> Trumbull </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Wefa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON> Bala </PERSON> <PERSON> Cynwyd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> still should be able to engineer a `` soft landing'' in which growth slows enough to cool inflation without causing an economic downturn. Ms. <PERSON> Trumbull </PERSON> said the weakness in manufacturing orders `` is probably one of the best things that could happen for the economy'' because it reduces concern that factories will overheat and face shortages that would drive up prices. In March, transportation orders rose 10.4 percent while most other industry categories posted declines. The jump in the transportation sector reflected a large boost in orders for aircraft and parts that more than offset a decline in demand for motor vehicles. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said the surge in orders for planes would have little immediate impact on the economy, since the aircraft manufacturing industry already has a large backlog of unfilled orders. In the defense category, which overlaps with the transportation sector and also is subject to wide swings, orders surged 29.1 percent in March after rising 19.7 percent in February and falling 34.5 percent in January. Excluding defense, all other orders were down 1.2 percent in March, the third straight monthly decline. In the key category of non-defense capital goods, considered a good indicator of business expansion plans, orders rose 2.9 percent last month to $ 38.1 billion after dropping 8.3 percent in February. In other categories, orders for primary metals such as steel were down 3.8 percent, demand for non-electrical machinery rose 1.4 percent and orders for electrical machinery dropped 6.7 percent. Shipments of durable goods were down 0.7 percent in March to a seasonally adjusted $ 120.1 billion, the third straight monthly decline.

 Soybean futures prices fell sharply for the second consecutive session Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as scattered rainfall in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> cooled drought fears.

<HEAD>USAir Orders Boeing Jets With Potential Value Of $1.7 Billion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has ordered 18 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 jetliners and taken options on 36 more in a deal with a potential value of about $ 1.7 billion, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. The announcement was the latest indication that the aerospace giant is continuing on a roll of large aircraft orders. It came just one day after <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s annual shareholders meeting, at which the plane manufacturer announced increased dividends and a stock split, and predicted record-breaking sales this year. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> considers a plane sold when it is delivered to the buyer. The <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> order includes flexibility for the airline to decide later whether it wants jets in the 737-300, -400 or -500 series. The -500 is the smallest, with capacity of 100 to 132 passengers, and the -400 is the largest, able to carry 145 to 170 passengers. Deliveries of the 18 firm orders will be one a month during 1991 and two monthly during the first quarter of 1992, with options possibly exercised in 1994 and 1995. The latest transaction brings <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION>'s current <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 orders to 68 aircraft, which will be delivered between now and 1992, plus 96 options, which would be delivered between 1992 and 1995, <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> said. Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> currently operates a fleet of 56 737-300s, the most of any airline. <ORGANIZATION> Piedmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, operates 39 737-300s and 14 737-400s and has six additional 737-400s on order. <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> will be merged with <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> on Aug 5. With the <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> order, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has received orders this year for 319 jetliners valued at about $ 19.7 billion. Of those, 120 orders are for 737s. In all of last year, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> had orders for 636 planes, valued at $ 29.7 billion. Total 737 orders stand at 2,384, making it the most popular commercial jet of all time. <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> also has ordered 20 <ORGANIZATION> Fokker </ORGANIZATION> 100 jets and holds options on 20 more. First delivery is scheduled for June. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> recently decided to buy as many as 40 MD-82 aircraft from <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Iowa Governor Asks Federal Drought Help For Cattle Industry</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Gov. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> asked federal officials Tuesday to help soften the effects of a spring drought by activating emergency feed programs and allowing cattle to graze on fragile acres normally held out of production. `` Our recent scattered rains may have helped in some areas, but certainly they were not dust-busters by any means,'' <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> said up to 40 percent of the state's pasture has been destroyed by dry weather this spring. <PERSON> Cattlemen </PERSON> said farmers already have started selling off their herds and may speed up the liquidation within the next two weeks if they do not get help. `` It is appropriate to take action early,'' the governor said. `` These are difficult times for our cattle producers.'' <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> asked <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> officials to activate emergency programs to give farmers financial aid in buying feed and to allow grazing on highly erodable acres taken out of production. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiese </PERSON> of Manning, president-elect of the <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cattlemen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said farmers are facing a bleak future because the prime months for growing pasture are April and May `` This is normally when we have lush growth in our pastures,'' he said. `` In many areas of our state, that's just not happening.'' Before any decision can be made on the assistance requests, a county-by-county survey must be completed, something <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> said could take two weeks. Programs the governor requested include: _ Allowing grazing on Conservation Reserve Program acres, land for which farmers receive annual payments to hold out of production That grazing would be allowed initially for 30 days, but could be extended if dry weather continues. _ Activating an emergency feed program giving up to 5 cents per pound for assistance to farmers purchasing feed _ Activating another feed program, where farmers can purchase feed owned by the government for 75 percent of its loan value `` They do not require any outlay of cash,'' <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> said, adding he was confident federal officials would approve the request. `` We're not asking for anything that's out of line or that will run into a wall of resistance.'' Government officials, however, have warned that farmers should not expect a massive federal bailout similar to one approved last year due to the drought that gripped much of the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Wiese </PERSON> said cattle farmers need some signal that government will help or many will begin to sell herds. `` We need some assurances to carry on,'' he said. <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> said the immediate threat was to livestock producers. `` We wo n't really know the impact on crops until much later,'' <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> said. He said he would seek drought aid for other farmers `` if the drought continues and worsens throughout the year.''

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the world's biggest supercomputer maker, on Tuesday reported a 94 percent decline in first-quarter earnings and said second-quarter earnings also could be down significantly. The company reported first-quarter net earnings of $ 1.5 million, or 5 cents a share, down from first-quarter earnings of $ 26.4 million, or 85 cents a share, for the same period in 1988. First-quarter revenue was $ 116.1 million, compared with $ 145.9 million for the 1988 quarter. `` We entered the year expecting the delivery of computer systems to be much higher in the second half of the year than the first,'' said <PERSON> Marcelo </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gumucio </PERSON>, president and chief operating officer. `` The revenue results for the first quarter are consistent with that outlook. `` Current delivery schedules indicate that more systems have shifted to the last half of the year and we now expect revenue for the second quarter to be similar to last year's second quarter,'' <PERSON> Gumucio </PERSON> said. But he added, `` We have not changed our objective of achieving a 10 percent revenue increase for the full year.'' <PERSON> Gumucio </PERSON> said all operating areas are exercising strong expense control in line with the company's revenue objective for the full year `` while we continue to invest fully in new product development projects to meet long-term objectives. Expenses will be spread more evenly through the year than revenues. `` This affected earnings in the first quarter and earnings in the second quarter could be down significantly from the same period a year ago for the same reason,'' he said. `` Earnings for the full year will depend primarily on our ability to meet the aggressive delivery schedules for the third and fourth quarters.'' During the first quarter, 13 systems were installed at customer sites, including seven new systems and six used systems. Three of the new systems were leased, as were four of the used systems, <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> posted a 6 percent increase in net earnings in 1988. It reported $ 756.3 million in revenues and $ 156.6 million in net profit for that year. <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, employs more than 5,200 people and has manufacturing and development facilities in <LOCATION> Chippewa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rice </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Colo </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Cable Industry Group Plans Programming for Schools</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Cable industry leaders are teaming up to encourage use of cable TV programming in the classroom, including a new daily news program that could rival a similar show for schools from <ORGANIZATION> Whittle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LP </ORGANIZATION>, cable industry and education sources said Tuesday. The effort, which is expected to be announced at a news conference Wednesday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, comes on the heels of Whittle's completion of a 25-show test in school classrooms of its commercially-sponsored news program, Channel One. The cable group includes some of the nation's biggest cable programmers and operators led by <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which operates <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> and reportedly will produce the daily news show. The Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> scheduled a news conference for Wednesday at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> to announce `` a new venture to benefit American schools.'' Also scheduled to attend were top officials of the cable <ORGANIZATION> networks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Entertainment, C-Span and The Discovery Channel, along with cable operators <ORGANIZATION> Tele-Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cablevision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> <PERSON> Intercable </PERSON>. Turner spokesmen refused to elaborate on the topic of the news conference and the other participants either declined comment or failed to return calls. But one education industry source, requesting anonymity, said he had been told <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> will disclose plans for a daily news show for use in schools. In addition to <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'s news show, the other networks either would create new programming or more heavily promote the availability of their existing shows for use in schools, cable industry sources said. `` It will be a mix of programming of current events and some cultural and educational type programming _ a nice mix,'' said one cable executive familiar with the group's plans, discussing it provided he was not identified. It was not clear whether the programming would contain commercials as Whittle's Channel One service does or whether the cable group would donate equipment on the scale of that envisioned in the Channel One project. Whittle launched Channel One, a daily 12-minute news show with two minutes of paid advertising, in six test schools March 6. The schools were each given about $ 50,000 in video equipment, TV monitors and satellite dishes in exchange for agreeing to run the program every school day. The cable industry effort was being viewed in part as a way for the cable industry to show it is being a good citizen at a time when calls have arisen for greater regulation of the industry. It also reflects an effort to protect cable's turf against the entry of an outsider, the <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>, Tenn.-based Whittle.

<HEAD>Survey: Traders Doing Business as Usual, Resist More Federal Rules</HEAD>

 Traders surveyed by one of the country's largest brokerage firms say they have not changed the way they do business despite the government's investigation of activities at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Eighty percent of more than 1,100 private speculators who responded to the <ORGANIZATION> Lind-Waldock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> survey said disclosure of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> probe on Jan. 23 had not affected their trading methods, the brokerage firm reported Tuesday. Sixty-nine percent said they believed trading pits at the nation's commodity futures exchanges operate honestly and efficiently _ but 63 percent thought the exchanges could do a better job of policing themselves. `` We wanted to know how our customers felt about the industry,'' said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lind </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Lind-Waldock </ORGANIZATION>, a Chicago-based futures discount brokerage. With futures trading in the headlines, he said, `` we thought it would be a good time to get information.'' The federal probe of suspected trading fraud at the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>, the world's two largest futures exchanges, has not yet produced any official charges or indictments. Of those who said they had changed the way they traded, 12 people _ or 1 percent _ said they had stopped trading as a result of the investigation. Others said they changed the type of orders they placed or said they were trading less than before. The survey was of active clients as of March. The brokerage said it did not have an unusual number of clients drop out in January and March as the investigation became known. `` I tend to think we have a image problem,'' <PERSON> Lins </PERSON> said, referring to those who had curtailed their trading. `` It's our fault because of our esoteric business. We have to explain why we are here and the importance of futures trading to the economy.'' Most of those expressing dissatisfaction in the survey opposed more federal regulation of futures trading, saying they feared it would reduce liquidity and volume on the trading floors, increasing the cost of transactions. `` I think the response to that question indicates the public wants reform,'' <PERSON> Lind </PERSON> said. The exchanges understood that when they created committees to recommend changes, he added. The ongoing investigation, in which undercover <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents have posed as traders, reportedly centers on allegations that as many as 100 brokers and traders cheated customers out of millions of dollars. A survey of traders conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> shortly after the federal investigation was revealed indicated that trading violations were numerous at the Mercantile Exchange. The 130 <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> traders responding to the Journal's survey blamed the violations on the way exchange rules are written and enforced. But they said cheating of customers was not common. Last week, a <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> panel recommended that most forms of `` dual trading'' be banned and floor surveillance of trading doubled to prevent wrongdoing. Dual trading, which is legal, enables traders to trade for their own accounts at the same time that they handle customers' orders. The Merc panel also recommended more extensive screening of applicants for membership, reform of the exchange's disciplinary committees and daily computerized trade information on the previous day's trades for members. <ORGANIZATION> Lind-Waldock </ORGANIZATION> conducted its survey in March. It mailed forms to 4,353 of its 13,000 customers and 1,142 replied. `` We were happy at the very high positive response we received and surprised at the extraordinarily high rate of return of our questionnaires,'' <PERSON> Lind </PERSON> said. `` People actually thanked us for the opportunity to voice their opinions.'' Seventy-eight percent said they were well served by the current open outcry system of filling orders. One respondent said attempts to automate trading would decrease confidence in the futures markets because it would take trading out of the public view.

<HEAD>Exxon Spill Has Generated Wave Of Lawsuits</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it has been hit with 31 lawsuits and 1,300 claims ranging from $ 500 to $ 4 million in connection with last month's Alaskan oil spill and expects further suits as well as government fines. At a meeting of securities analysts, top executives of the nation's biggest oil company said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> already had paid $ 400,000 to settle smaller claims brought mainly by fishermen and cannery workers whose jobs were disrupted because of the March 24 spill that fouled hundreds of miles of coastline. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> executives declined to put a dollar value on the existing lawsuits or the claims. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON>, who has been criticized for staying out of sight in the crucial days following the disaster, said that in retrospect he would have responded differently. However, he said he did not understand the public anger against the company, especially because it had accepted the blame and apologized for the spill and was cleaning it up. `` I'm angry with myself,'' <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON> said. `` It's not really clear to me as to why everyone is so angry _ once we get past the point of admitting it was our ship that went on the rocks.'' <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> said all but two of the lawsuits were class actions against the company. All but one were filed in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> state and federal courts, he said, with the remaining suit filed in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> has four separate insurance policies totaling $ 599.8 million in cleanup and liability coverage, including a $ 400 million policy that would pay off even in cases of company negligence. But <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> said the various policies ca n't necessarily be added together. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> said the insurance would cover most, if not all, of the cleanup costs and that `` therefore it's impossible for us at this point to make any provision for our earnings for any reserves.'' On Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> announced that it had charged $ 30 million against first-quarter earnings for expenses associated with the salvage and repair of the broken tanker but not for the cleanup itself. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> also said the company probably was subject to fines but did not yet know what fines various government agencies might impose. <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON> said the company did not anticipate any punitive damages due to the spill, in which an Exxon tanker ran onto a reef and spewed more than 11 million gallons of crude oil into Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. `` There obviously was no intent on our part _ to put a very expensive ship on <PERSON> Bligh </PERSON> reef, to put expensive oil in the water and then a very, very, very expensive cleanup,'' <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON> said. In response to criticism that <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> did not have enough people working on the cleanup, <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> would increase the number to about 4,000 by next month. He also reiterated his optimism that, despite concerns by <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> officials, the major part of the spill would be cleaned up by September. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> told a news conference Monday that the cleanup was ahead of the pace calculated in the oil company's federally-approved plan, which estimates cleanup completion by Sept. 15. When questioned about the impact of a possible boycott against <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON> said that with anticipated tight supplies and high demand during the summer season, `` it's hard to see this summer how we would n't be able to sell all the gasoline we can make.'' A number of consumer activists have called for a boycott of <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> to punish the company for what they claim is its poor response to the disaster and alleged negligence leading to the spill. `` The boycott will damage the dealers who are independent business people,'' <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rawl </PERSON> said the spill has n't changed <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s outlook or spending plans. He also declined to specify when the company would declare its next dividend, which generally is issued quarterly. As to changing <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s tarnished image, he said, `` It's pretty clear there's a better way to do that job, but we have n't had time to sort that out. We're going to have to do a hell of a lot better job than we have done.''

<HEAD>Study Shows Elderly Care Causing Wrinkles In The Workplace</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Employees caring for elderly relatives often experience job-related stress and increased absenteeism, and corporate <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> can expect even more of these problems as the population ages, a private study released Tuesday found. `` If elder care is a problem now _ and it is _ we had better find good, humane answers soon. If we do n't, the future ... will turn into a nightmare for millions of us,'' said <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Morton </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hancock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, which conducted the study along with Fortune magazine. The study was based on responses from 370 senior executives and 369 people in the general employee population. It found that six out of 10 senior executives were aware of specific work-related problems with elder care-giving employees. Forty-five percent of the executive respondents noticed employee stress; 38 percent, unscheduled days off; 37 percent, late arrivals and early departures; 32 percent, above-average use of the telephone; and 30 percent, absenteeism, the survey said. Those in service companies were more likely than industrial companies to report having these problems, the survey said. A vast majority of the employees questioned _ 70 percent _ admitted that taking care of elderly relatives or friends interfered with job performance. Fifty-one percent of them said they felt increased tension on the job as a result of their responsibilities, the survey said. Forty-four percent also admitted to increased use of the telephone and that same percentage had to take more time off for emergencies, the survey said. Fourteen percent said their productivity was affected, it said. The survey found that women were more likely to shoulder responsibilities for caring for the elderly and take a so-called `` daughter track'' approach, in which their careers are slowed as they juggle work and parental care. Executives have n't been immune to these problems, either. The survey said that half of them are personally responsible for an elderly person now or have been in the past two years, and one out of every two executives reports being concerned about maintaining job performance. Care-givers spend on average 13 hours a week tending to the elderly, usually a parent, with responsibilties ranging from providing transportation and companionship to performing simple household chores. About a quarter of all full-time employees in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> reportedly provide some care for the elderly, who represent roughly 12 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population. That figure is likely to increase over the years, with the elderly population expected to nearly double by the year 2030 and as nursing home care expenses rise. `` With this rapid increase in the elderly population and with caring for the elderly being a family responsibility, we must expect growing pressure on the workplace,'' said <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaines-Ross </PERSON>, a research director for Fortune. `` This dual responsibilty will be overwhelming _ both emotionally and financially. `` This dual responsibility will affect business' bottom line,'' resulting from lost employee production and higher health-care expenses. Few companies, though, offer programs to deal with this problem, other than providing things like unpaid leaves of absence or personal days to their employees, Ms. <PERSON> Gaines-Ross </PERSON> noted. `` It might be beneficial for corporations to educate managers as to the enormity of elder care responsibilities,'' she said. `` Understanding the problem goes a long way to coping with it and resolving it.'' The survey's margin of error was plus or minus 5 percentage points.

 Contracts settled through collective bargaining in the first three months of 1989 gave workers average annual wage increases of 3.1 percent over the life of the pacts, the government reported Tuesday. The wage gains were up from the 2.2 percent average raises provided during the life of contracts settled in the fourth quarter of 1988 and also ahead of the 2.4 percent average wage gains contained in collective bargaining agreements settled in all of last year. Analysts said the new gains were in line with other <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> data showing wage inflation growing because of tight labor markets. The quarterly report on collective bargaining, like the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s broader Employment Cost Index report, showed workers in the fast-growing service sector winning larger wage gains than manufacturing workers. `` That's where the tighter labor markets are,'' chief economist <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said of service-providing parts of the economy The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the 64 first-quarter collective bargaining agreements it analyzed covered 199,000 workers. The average length of the contracts was just under three years, with only seven being for less than two years. First-year pay gains averaged 3.2 percent with average wage increases of 3.1 percent in the second and third years of the contracts, the department said. The government, which tracks agreements covering bargaining units with at least 1,000 members, said 107 such contracts affecting 636,000 workers had expired or been reopened in the first quarter but had not been settled or ratified by April 1. Of that group, about 350,000 employees worked for railroads and 104,000 for airlines, with the remaining number dispersed throughout a variety of industries. The first-quarter report showed that workers who received lump-sum payments from their employers or had cost-of-living adjustment clauses in their contracts on average received smaller wage increases than workers who received neither of those forms of compensation. About 30,000 workers got lump-sum payments as part of contracts negotiated in the first quarter and their pay raises averaged 1.8 percent a year over the lives of the new contracts. Contracts affecting 21,000 workers contained COLA clauses, generally tied to the government's inflation index, and the annual wage gains in those agreements averaged 2.4 percent, the government said. More than 75 percent of the workers whose contracts were settled in the first quarter worked in the non-manufacturing sector of the economy, and their annual pay gains averaged 3.3 percent over the lives of the contracts. In the manufacturing sector, where lump-sum payments and COLA clauses are prevalent, wage increases averaged 2.3 percent annually over the contract lives.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> quoted several sports figures _ <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lasorda </PERSON>, <PERSON> Satchel </PERSON> <PERSON> Paige </PERSON> and <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> _ and gave a `` high five to high tech'' during a pep talk on competitiveness Tuesday in <LOCATION> Silicon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. Critics complained, however, that he did n't say enough about unfair trade by foreign competitors in his speech before business leaders and workers at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION>'s Space Systems Division. After <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> received boos for his reference to <PERSON> Lasorda </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dodgers </ORGANIZATION> manager who is an enemy to <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION> fans, the president won applause for advocating a cut in the capital gains tax and a boost in spending for <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and other science and technology. He praised <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION>, which recently delivered the first of two communications Superbird satellites to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in a $ 209 million contract, as a good example of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s ability to compete internationally. `` Today, American satellites are among the most competitive spacecraft for customers who want affordable, high-powered communications satellites,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He quoted former pitcher <PERSON> Satchel </PERSON> <PERSON> Paige </PERSON> _ `` Do n't look back. Somebody might be gaining on you.'' _ and said <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> must invest in the future by developing new programs to accommodate a changing workforce. As an example, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> cited <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s Employee Assistance Program, which helps workers find child-care help. Though <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> offered no new strategies for increasing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> productivity or improving <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s ability to compete abroad, his appearance in the nation's high-technology capital early in his term showed an eagerness to stimulate business. `` I think it fires up the people to want to be competitive, to realize they're making progress, and to want to be in the forefront of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s success for exports and products for our own use,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>, vice president and general manager of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s Space Systems Division <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoeber </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s commercial space programs operations, led <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on a tour of the facility's space environmental chamber, which duplicates temperatures in space, and showed him the next Superbird satellite. `` This is a case study to show American businessmen what is possible if they're willing to take the time and make the investment in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and other countries,'' said <PERSON> Hoeber </PERSON>. `` There's no reason why Americans ca n't be as competitive as anyone else. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, mayor of <LOCATION> Sunnyvale </LOCATION> in the heart of <LOCATION> Silicon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, criticized <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for saying very little about fair, free trade and the restrictive policies of other countries. But Stone commended <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for returning to an area that he lost `` fairly handily'' in the November election. `` He came back within the first 100 days and gave a message that I think will be widely accepted by the corporations here _ the capital gains tax and the extension on research and development tax credits.'' Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, the first-term <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> congressman and <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> professor who represents much of <LOCATION> Silicon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, accompanied <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on his first domestic speaking tour since entering office. `` The R & amp; D tax credit is so important and the capital gains tax is critical,'' <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said. `` He's hitting it in every speech.'' <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said he talked with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aboard Air Force One about other ways to boost competitiveness, including improving access to foreign markets, ending excessive litigation and guarding against transferring technology to other countries that could hurt <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> business. `` We talked explicitly about access to foreign markets in connection with the semiconductor agreement to sell to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not mention the semiconductor problem in his speech.

 Energy futures prices surged in brisk trading Tuesday, with gasoline leading the pack amid continued concerns about supplies.

<HEAD>Soybeans Plunge Again On Wetter Weather</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Soybean futures prices fell sharply Tuesday for the second consecutive session on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as scattered rainfall in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> continued to cool drought fears. Wheat futures finished nearly unchanged. On other markets, petroleum futures prices surged; hog futures advanced strongly while other livestock and meat markets were mixed; and precious metals prices declined. Wheat settled 1 \ cents lower to 1 -RCB- cents higher with the contract for delivery in May at $ 4.14 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 3 cents to 5 cents lower with May at $ 2.64 a bushel; oats were 5 -LCB- cents to 7 \ cents lower with May at $ 1.89 a bushel; soybeans were 10 cents to 15 cents lower with May at $ 7.32 -LCB- a Overnight rain in the western Corn Belt and forecasts for more rain over the next few days prompted moderate to heavy selling of soybean, corn and oat futures contracts right from the opening bell. `` It's a weather market,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON>, a grain-market analyst in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Balfour </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maclaine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The various private forecasters used by futures traders were in closer agreement about the weather outlook than they had been in the past two weeks, <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> issued a six-to-10-day forecast late Monday that predicted normal temperatures and normal rainfall in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> early next week. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that corn planting got under way in most major producing areas last week. Soybean planting will begin in early May. But the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> also said most of the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> winter wheat crop was in poor to very poor condition last week due to a lack of moisture. That report helped support the wheat market. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, gasoline prices jumped nearly 4 cents a gallon, fueled by rumors of problems on the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> pipeline and concerns about refiners' ability to provide cleaner-burning gasoline to states mandating a switch to a tougher anti-pollution standard. `` It was a wild and crazy day in that respect,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` I ca n't remember the last time there was a near 4-cent increase in gasoline prices, if ever. <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON> said the rally also was helped along by word that an oil platform damaged last week in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> will be out of action into early May. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 5 cents lower to 80 cents higher with June at $ 21.41 a barrel; heating oil was .05 cent lower to .27 cent higher, with May at 52.08 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .40 cent to 3.93 cents higher, with May at 76.16 cents a gallon. Hog prices for June, July and August delivery leaped on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> amid signs that hog slaughter levels are falling. The rally extended Monday's slight gains in a market strengthened by bullish chart patterns. `` It's all due to expectations we're going to be getting into lighter kills in June, July and August,'' said <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>, an independent livestock trader in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Cattle futures finished mixed after rebounding from a steep slide that flushed many small speculators out of the market, <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> said. Live cattle settled .25 cent lower to .10 cent higher with June at 70.52 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .45 cent lower to .12 cent higher with May at 76 cents a pound; live hogs were .03 cent lower to 1 cent higher with June at 46.60 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .60 cent lower to .35 cent higher with May at 31.57 cents a pound. Gold and silver futures retreated on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, erasing much of the previous session's advance, in the face of a stronger <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar and a smaller-than-expected increase in March durable-goods orders, both signs that inflationary pressures are easing. Gold settled $ 2 to $ 2.50 lower with June at $ 388.89 a troy ounce; silver was 3.6 cents to 3.8 cents lower with May at $ 5.795 a troy ounce.

 The dollar finished higher against most major currencies Tuesday, recovering from an early selloff. Gold prices declined slightly in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dealings after edging a bit higher on foreign markets. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a bid of $ 384.75 for a troy ounce of gold at 4 p.m. EDT, $ 2 lower than Monday's late bid. <PERSON> Zlatko </PERSON> <PERSON> Glamuzina </PERSON>, chief currency dealer at <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> di </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sicilia </ORGANIZATION>, said dealers sold dollars after the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> released a report on `` big ticket'' durable goods orders. The reported said orders rose 0.8 percent in March. But, excluding the increase in the volatile transportation category, orders were off 2.8 percent and analysts interpreted the figure as evidence of slower economic growth. A report from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> said sales of existing homes dropped for the third straight month in March to the slowest pace in more than a year, an indication that rising mortgage interest rates are discouraging home buyers. On the inflation front, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said wages and salaries paid American workers in private industry rose 4.2 percent in the last 12 months, the biggest jump in 3 -LCB- years. The Employment Cost Index reading was consistent with recent reports pointing to a buildup in inflationary pressures in a tight job market. <PERSON> Glamuzina </PERSON> said the dollar slowly recovered amid mainly institutional buying. Trading was fairly subdued, he said. The markets were quiet ahead of the first-quarter <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> gross national product report due on Wednesday, foreign exchange dealers said. The announcement that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> will resign focused attention on the yen. The Japanese currency was firmer as a result. The dollar closed at 131.17 yen, down from Monday's late 131.38. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> late Tuesday, the dollar traded higher at 131.28 yen, and at 131.475 yen in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, down from 131.55 yen Monday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> one British pound cost $ 1.7030 late Tuesday, cheaper for buyers than Monday's late level of $ 1.7050. Sterling stood at $ 1.69945 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> compared to $ 1.70625 Monday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Monday's levels, included: 1.86655 West German marks, up from 1.86075; 1.64625 Swiss francs, up from 1.6420; 1.18925 Canadian dollars, unchanged; 6.3175 French francs, up from 6.3070; and 1,367.20 Italian lire, up from 1,364.625 Other late rates for the dollar in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> compared with Monday's late rates included: 1.8625 West German marks, up from 1.8575; 1.6435 Swiss francs, up from 1.6395; 6.3065 French francs, up from 6.2975; 2.1000 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0960; and, 1.1910 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1890 Italian markets were closed for a holiday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar closed at 1,366.00 Italian lire, up from 1,362.50 in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> on Monday. Gold bullion prices rose by less than $ 1 an ounce on markets abroad and then fell in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trading. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold bullion for current delivery fell to $ 385.70 a troy ounce from Monday's settlement of $ 387.70. The late bid price for gold in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the major <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> precious metals market, was $ 385.75 a troy ounce, up from $ 384.90 late Monday. The late <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION> bid price was $ 385, up from $ 384.65. Earlier in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> gold closed at $ 385.65 bid, up from $ 384.05. Silver prices barely budged overseas and edged slighly lower in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. On <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Comex, silver bullion for current delivery closed at $ 5.789 a troy ounce, down from $ 5.825 Monday. Silver bullion traded late in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at $ 5.81 bid a troy ounce, unchanged.

<HEAD>USX Profits Rise; Bethlehem Profits Fall</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s profits shot up 88 percent while <ORGANIZATION> Bethlehem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s profits fell 24 percent, the nation's biggest and second-biggest steelmakers said Tuesday in first-quarter reports. Pittsburgh-based <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> said its net income surged 88 percent to $ 296 million, or $ 1.09 per share, led by a near three-fold increase in operating income at <ORGANIZATION> Marathon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Operating income from steel sagged 40 percent to $ 99 million on sales of $ 1.5 billion Income from continuing operations at <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> shrank from $ 7 million to $ 3 million even though sales grew 42 percent from $ 276 million to $ 393 million. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Gas eported operating income of $ 147 million, but $ 144 million of that came from the settlement of lawsuits concerning take-or-pay supply contracts, said company spokesman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryder </PERSON>. Overall sales grew by 12.5 percent to $ 4.5 billion from $ 4.0 billion in the 1988 first quarter, when profits were $ 157 million, or 52 cents per share. Marathon contributed operating income of $ 241 million on $ 2.4 billion in first-quarter sales compared with $ 84 million on $ 2.1 billion in sales a year earlier. `` Second-quarter operating results should be even stronger'' in energy, <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> said in a printed statement. Marathon's improvement was the result of higher profit margins on refined products, greater volume and higher prices for crude oil and natural gas and lower exploration costs. The company spent $ 31 million exploring for oil and gas in the first quarter, down from $ 50 million a year earlier. Operating income in steel declined from $ 167 million on sales of $ 1.4 billion. `` The decline ... was due primarily to continued weakness in the oil country tubular goods market and increased costs for raw materials,'' <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> said. Income from the diversified group of <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> dropped from $ 98 million on $ 341 million in 1988 first-quarter sales to $ 30 million on $ 252 million in sales, reflecting the sale of businesses in the group and a $ 43 million on-time credit last year. <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> received $ 83 million in extraordinary income in the first quarter due primarily to the sale of assets, including the phosphate fertilizer business of the <ORGANIZATION> Agri-Chemicals </ORGANIZATION> dividion and the sale of 25 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Quebec </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cartier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The company boosted capital spending by $ 143 million to $ 372 million. `` Even after this relatively heavy capital spending ... the corporation's cash balance continues over $ 2 billion,'' <PERSON> Roderick </PERSON> said. `` This cash flow for the first quarter is on track with our goal of generating more than $ 1 billion in 1989, permitting continuation of our program to strengthen our balance sheet and enhance shareholder value.'' <ORGANIZATION> Bethlehem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> said its 24 percent decline was the result of a one-time charge. The <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, Pa.-based steelmaker said its net income fell to $ 64.7 million, or 78 cents per share, from $ 85.4 million, or $ 1.23 per share, a year earlier. Sales rose 5.6 percent to $ 1.4 billion from $ 1.33 billion in the comparable period a year earlier. The nation's second-largest steelmaker said it charged $ 55 million against the first quarter as the cost of reorganizing its troubled <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> Division. The division could be hurt further by a strike that was begun March 17 by members of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> said. The 1988 first quarter results included a charge of $ 19 million over a coal mine fire and employee benefits and a $ 10 million credit as an investment tax credit refund. Shipments increased 2 percent from 2.6 million tons to 2.7 million tons. Production declined 1 percent to 3.2 million tons as the company operated at 82 percent of capacity, only 1 percentage point below the 1988 first quarter. Chairman <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said he expects shipments to remain about the same at least through the second quarter. He said second half industry shipments will decline from levels of the first half. <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>'s future financial performance will be affected by its contract negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steelworkers </ORGANIZATION> and by the extent to which the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's renews steel import quotas due to expire in September, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday their first-quarter earnings fell from the levels of last year, when they had one-time gains on asset sales. Another media company, <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, also reported a decline in its first-quarter profit. Times Mirror, owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Newsday </ORGANIZATION> and other papers, said it earned $ 68.8 million, or 53 cents a share, in the first quarter, down 8 percent from $ 75.1 million, or 58 cents a share, a year earlier. First-quarter sales rose 9.3 percent to $ 846.9 million from $ 774.6 million a year earlier. The Times Mirror results for the first quarter of 1988 included an after-tax gain of $ 15.3 million from sale of timberland and of Times-Mirror Press. If that gain were excluded, this year's profit would have risen 15 percent, the Los Angles-based media concern said. Newspaper publishing revenue, hurt in recent months by soft demand for advertising, rose 11 percent in the quarter because of higher advertising volume, cost-cutting and the fact the accounting period was five days longer than last year's. Advertising performance improved at the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> Sun papers, but continued slow in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Revenue rose 9 percent for book, magazine and other publishing and 17 percent for cable television. Broadcast TV revenue declined less than 1 percent. In addition to the Times, <ORGANIZATION> Newsday </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> Sun papers, <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> holdings include The <ORGANIZATION> Hartford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Courant </ORGANIZATION>, The -LRB- <LOCATION> Allentown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> -RRB- Morning Call, The -LRB- <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> -RRB- Advocate and <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> -RRB- Time; <ORGANIZATION> KDFW-TV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and other publishing, broadcast and cable TV operations. <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> newspaper and <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> and has interests in TV stations and cable television, said its earnings tumbled 71 percent to $ 41.5 million, or $ 3.22 a share, in the first quarter from $ 144.8 million, or $ 11.25 a share, a year earlier. First-quarter revenue rose 6.5 percent to $ 341.9 million from $ 321.2 million a year earlier. The 1988 results had included a non-recurring gain of $ 115.7 million from the sale of cellular telephone interests. Excluding that gain, the company said its earnings would have risen 42 percent from a year earlier. Newspaper division revenue rose 7 percent in the latest quarter as advertising lineage at the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> edged up 3 percent. Revenue from the company's four television stations rose 5 percent and cable division revenue rose 13 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION>'s revenue rose 1 percent from a year ago Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> said its profit fell 39.3 percent to $ 20.5 million, or 39 cents a share, from $ 33.8 million, or 59 cents a share, a year earlier. First-quarter revenue rose 10.4 percent to $ 540.7 million from $ 489.7 million a year earlier. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>, senior vice president and chief financial officer, said, `` This was a difficult quarter, but the results were just about what we expected when we set our 1989 budget.'' He said more than half of the decline was due to acquisitions, including the purchase of <ORGANIZATION> Dialog </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> and an investment in a cable operation, while the rest reflected `` softness in operations and higher interest rates.'' He said he expected growth in earnings per share for the year, partly because of softening newsprint prices, stronger operating results from the newspaper division and growth in business information services. He said the company also expects to benefit from lower interest costs as the result of the previously-disclosed agreements to sell its eight television stations and two newspapers. <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> owns 30 newspapers, offers a variety of electronic business information services and has interests in cable television.

 <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> plans to give refunds to thousands of customers in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> after one man complained he was overcharged $ 60 by the long-distance telephone company. Sprint officials have acknowledged that thousands of their 22,000 Las Vegas customers were overcharged from April through August of 1988 because computers recorded the wrong time of day for the phone calls. The mistake also affected credit-card customers dialing from <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. Sprint officials declined to estimate how much the refunds would be. The refunds were prompted by <PERSON> Lenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Frome </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> resident who complained about a billing error to the company last year. <PERSON> Frome </PERSON>, a retired aerospace engineer who teaches mathematics at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nevada-Las </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vegas </ORGANIZATION>, figured the company owed him about $ 60 in overcharges. When he felt the company was delaying in resolving the issue, <PERSON> Frome </PERSON> took his complaint to former Sen.

He said customers should receive refunds within a month after that.

 Stock prices slumped Tuesday as traders pulled profits from an unenthusiastic market and oil and technology company earnings declined. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 15.77 points to 2,386.91, the second straight decline after a four-week rise that pushed the market to post-crash highs. Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 8 to 7 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 687 up, 827 down and 471 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> totaled 165.43 million shares, up from 142.10 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 196.49 million shares. Analysts cited a tepid environment with traders lacking conviction in the recently rising market. They said the gains were achieved in fits and starts, not in a solid atmosphere, and the selloffs this week reflected that weakness. `` It's like being a 100-yard dash runner in a marathon,'' said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarrett </PERSON>, a technical analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` You last a little bit then you have to rest.'' Analysts said many investors felt it was time to sell into the market, considering the Dow Jones average's rise of more than 150 points in the last month and uncertainty on the economy and interest rates. `` It was a little excuse to take some profits,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Toole </PERSON>, manager of over-the-counter trading at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Wall Street opened with a first-hour flurry after a government report that showed durable goods orders rising 0.8 percent in March and a resilient <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> market that leaped despite Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s resignation announcement But confidence soon sagged, analysts said, and steady selling occurred as it did Monday, when the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> lost 6.78 points but remained above 2,400. Tuesday's weakness was greatest in oil, technology and airline stocks. Among the most active issues, Citizens and Southern plunged 4 | to 29 -RRB- as 2.5 million shares changed hands The decline followed <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION>'s withdrawal of its buyout offer for the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> bank. <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> plummeted 6 -LRB- to 49.

<HEAD>Crop Yields Could Drop</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A private analyst said Tuesday that poor moisture reserves in much of the nation's midsection have already taken a modest bite out of this year's crop yields and that the situation could worsen if the rains are n't abundant this spring. Economist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnittker </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Schnittker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based agricultural consulting firm, said that the 1988 drought `` remains the leading force in world agriculture,'' at least until more is known about this year's crops of wheat and corn. Both <PERSON> Schnittker </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> project huge declines in world and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inventories as a result of last year's drought-shriveled yields in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> By July 1, he said, the global grain inventory going into the new 1989-90 season will be down to a 61-day supply, compared with an 87-day reserve last summer. That will be the smallest reserve since the early 1970s, when global grain stocks were drawn down to a 57-day supply. Speaking to a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journalists </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Schnittker </PERSON> said the supply situation puts the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` sort of on the razor's edge'' because of the uncertainties about 1989 crop conditions. Although many areas are dramatically improved from last year's summer drought, parts of the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> and Corn Belt are still woefully dry Even in some areas that have moderate surface moisture, the reserves deep in the subsoil are scant. `` And if we do have a second adverse crop-growing season, the effect will be substantially larger in the commodities markets and in the consumer food retail markets than they have been the past year,'' <PERSON> Schnittker </PERSON> said. The reduced 1988 harvests forced up market prices for the major crops as it became apparent that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> granary would be partially emptied. <PERSON> Schnittker </PERSON> said he finds himself `` disagreeing quite a lot'' with <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s chief meteorologist, <PERSON> Norton </PERSON> <PERSON> Strommen </PERSON>, who told the farm writers earlier that he was still optimistic that crop conditions will improve and that nationally the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can have a productive year. <PERSON> Strommen </PERSON> and others maintain the fate of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> winter wheat crop will not be known for another month or so and that farmers still have not planted spring wheat or made much of a dent in planting corn. `` If I seem a little on the optimistic side, it may be that I'm looking at changes that have occurred and the improvements that have taken place since the fall of 1988 and the real harshness of the 1988 drought,'' <PERSON> Strommen </PERSON> said Acknowledging there are pockets of drought problems still around _ <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, for example, where about 75 percent of the winter wheat is reported in very poor or poor condition _ <PERSON> Strommen </PERSON> said many other sections of the country have had good moisture last year in recent months. `` When you put all of the big parts together, the overall outlook for the country is much improved over what it was last year,'' <PERSON> Strommen </PERSON> said. `` But we are still deeply concerned about the pockets and the problems we have in the western <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> and the central part of the Corn Belt.'' <PERSON> Schnittker </PERSON> said <PERSON> Strommen </PERSON> `` may turn out to be right, but it seems to me, with the extreme ... subsoil drought concentrated on the central Corn Belt at the moment, that it is prudent for private forecasters, at least, to reduce the probable corn yield a little bit.'' Already, he said, the moisture problems have shaved this year's average corn yield If all had been normal, the yield trend pointed to an average of about 120 bushels per acre, but <PERSON> Schnittker </PERSON> says he thinks 115 bushels are more likely. That would mean a 1989 corn harvest of about 7.54 billion bushels, up from 5.1 billion bushels estimated for 1988. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> currently estimates last year's corn harvest at 4.92 billion bushels but has not projected the 1989 crop. Based on April 25 conditions, <PERSON> Schnittker </PERSON> forecast this year's total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat harvest at 2.15 billion bushels, about 300 million bushels less than the output would be if moisture conditions had been normal Last year's wheat harvest was 1.81 billion bushels.

Tuesday reported a 17.9 percent increase in earnings for the January to March quarter and another big consumer products company, <ORGANIZATION> Kimberly-Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said its quarterly income went up 10.5 percent <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, said its after-tax earnings rose to $ 310 million, or $ 1.85 a share, in the three months ended March 31, up from $ 263 million, or $ 1.53 a share, a year earlier. Sales rose to $ 5.43 billion in the January-March period, the third quarter in the company's fiscal year, up 11.7 percent from $ 4.86 billion a year earlier. The company credited higher selling prices, greater sales volumes and currency translation adjustments as reasons for its profit growth. These factors were partially offset by a higher estimated tax rate. For the first nine months of <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION>'s fiscal year, net income came to $ 1.04 billion, or $ 6.13 a share, on sales of $ 15.97 billion. In the corresponding period the year before, earnings were $ 880 million, or $ 5.14 a share, and sales totaled $ 14.36 billion. The company manufactures and markets a wide range of laundry and cleaning products, personal care products, foods and beverages, plus a variety of items used by businesses and industry. In a release from <ORGANIZATION> Kimberly-Clark </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> office, the company said its first quarter income increased to $ 103.1 million, or $ 1.28 share, from $ 93.3 million, or $ 1.16 a share, in 1988's first quarter. Sales amounted to $ 1.42 billion, a 9.9 percent pickup from the comparable 1988 quarter, in which sales totaled $ 1.29 billion. Net income improved because of increased earnings from equity companies and lower interest expense, <PERSON> Darwin </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. About 60 percent of the sales improvement in the quarter can be attributed to increased sales volumes, which were achieved in most major businesses, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. Volume increases were led by consumer tissue, feminine care and disposable diaper businesses in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Operating profit, however, dropped 4.9 percent to $ 171.7 million from $ 180.5 million. <ORGANIZATION> Kimberly-Clark </ORGANIZATION> attributed the drop in operating profit to higher marketing expenses because of intense competition. It also cited weakening newsprint markets, higher fiber costs worldwide and expenses associated with new products, particularly Huggies Pull-Ups training pants. <ORGANIZATION> Kimberly-Clark </ORGANIZATION> is a manufacturer of household, personal care and health care products, including Kleenex tissues, and newsprint and business, correspondence and specialty papers.

<HEAD>Chairman: Alaska Spill Should Not Stall Exploration in Wildlife Refuge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil spill is a tragic accident that should not be used to prevent oil industry development of such controversial sites as the <ORGANIZATION> Arctic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s top official told shareholders Tuesday. Th spill resulted from a transportation accident unrelated to oil exploration or production, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrow </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive officer, told the company's 100th annual meeting in prepared remarks. `` Overseas oil is being transported daily to ports throughout the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> by an increasing number of ocean tankers,'' <PERSON> Morrow </PERSON> said. `` These tanker shipments will continue to escalate in the years ahead if we do not develop more of this nation's energy resources _ particularly oil and natural gas.'' <PERSON> Morrow </PERSON>, who also is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said the industry is re-examining its operational policies in the wake of the spill. He said a task force of top oil-company executives is conducting a comprehensive review of industry spill-prevention and cleanup capabilities. Two weeks after the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> spill of 11 million gallons of crude oil in fragile Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called the accident an `` aberration'' that had not dissuaded him from urging <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to authorize exploratory drilling in the Arctic refuge. `` I am not going to suggest that because of this -LRB- spill -RRB- that we should rethink a policy of trying to get this country less dependent on foreign oil,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Environmentalists disagree. `` If we want to prospect for oil, we should do it in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>,'' director <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Denman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Safe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communication </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> said earlier this month. <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> recently has been emphasizing its overseas operations, company spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> acknowledged. But he said the opening of some of the `` last-frontier'' areas domestically _ such as the Arctic refuge on <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s North Slope and other sites considered environmentally fragile _ would present new opportunities for domestic exploration and production. <ORGANIZATION> Amoco </ORGANIZATION> has no share of the <LOCATION> Prudhoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> oil fields on the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Slope </LOCATION>, whose crude oil is channeled through the trans-Alaska pipeline to tankers at <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> like the one that caused the disastrous March 24 spill. The company does have limited production in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Inlet </LOCATION> and a small share in a field in the <LOCATION> Beaufort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, as well as inactive exploration acreage in <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Beaufort </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chukchi </LOCATION> seas, <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Miller Starts New Commercials To Boost High Life Sales</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Attempting to reverse the decline in its flagship High Life brand, <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> unveiled new commercials Tuesday promoting the beer as a reward for everyday heros. The new High Life campaign, under the slogan, `` The best comes shining through,'' is reminiscent of the Miller-time commercials of the 1970s that touted beer as a reward for regular work. For example, one commercial in the new series extols a man who helps a woman cross the street, and another salutes a farmer who helps harvest corn for the widow of a friend. Others praise a man in a wheelchair who is playing basketball and show a member of a car-racing team warning a competitor of a mechanical problem with his car, thereby possibly losing the race but doing the honorable thing at the same time. `` These ads portray people who do the right thing,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Toledo </PERSON>, vice president of brand management and promotions for <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. And unlike the <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> time ads `` these celebrate basic human values and elevate the man and the beer'' and not just a regular job well-done. High Life sales fell to sixth place last year from third in 1987 among the top domestic brewers, according to statistics from <ORGANIZATION> Beverage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION>, a liquor industry publication. Beverage Media estimated 8.5 million barrels of High Life were sold last year, down from 9.3 million in 1987. Moving past High Life in the rankings were Bud Light at 9.7 million barrels, <ORGANIZATION> Coors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> at 8.7 million barrels and <LOCATION> Busch </LOCATION> at 8.6 million, the publication said. The top sellers were Budweiser at 50.6 million barrels and <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> <PERSON> Lite </PERSON> at 19.6 million barrels. The new ad campaign for <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> was the first developed for the brand by <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Defense spending cuts proposed Tuesday include axing funds for the new V-22 Osprey transport aircraft, a move which could cost the jobs of up to 2,000 <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helicopter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Textron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, company officials said. The workers could face layoffs within 10 days, and another 500 jobs could be cut within a year, <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> officials said in a letter to employees before the cuts were formally proposed. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> outlined $ 10 billion in <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> cuts before a hearing of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> has been told to scrap development of the V-22 aircraft, which is manufactured as a joint project by <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helicopter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. The two companies are developing the tilt-rotor aircraft under a $ 1.8 billion contract, scheduled to run through mid-1992. The Pentagon is required to cut future spending plans by $ 10 billion for the next fiscal year under a budget agreement the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> reached earlier this spring. The cuts also reportedly were to include cancellation of another large <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> program, the OH-58D <ORGANIZATION> AHIP </ORGANIZATION> helicopter. Although the company had not been officially informed of the cuts, <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> was required by federal plant-closing legislation to notify employees of possible layoffs, spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Leder </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Leder </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> has not formulated specific layoff plans, but he said a `` worst-case scenario'' might require <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> to lay off 1,800 to 2,000 workers within 10 days. A total of 2,500 workers could lose their jobs within a year, he added.

 <ORGANIZATION> Myerson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Kuhn </PERSON>, the law firm co-headed by former baseball commissioner <PERSON> Bowie </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuhn </PERSON>, has been accused of billing <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> approximately $ 2 million for work that <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> says the law firm did not perform. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>, confirmed Tuesday the existence of an investigation into the matter, disclosed in Monday's editions of The Wall Street Journal. `` There have been billing irregularities,'' <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> said. `` We have have brought them to the attention of <ORGANIZATION> Myerson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Kuhn </PERSON> and we have ended the relationship.''

<TEXT>
 Japanese Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s resignation likely will further delay action on the controversial FSX fighter project, official sources said Tuesday Some high-level sources suggested the end result could be a weaker deal for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, or a complete unraveling of the plan to jointly build a new fighter based on the American F-16. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s announcement that he would step down as a result of an influence-peddling scandal brings new uncertainty to the already-troubled FSX plan, said administration and congressional officials, all of whom declined to be identified. The sources suggested it is now unlikely there will be any movement in stalled negotiations on the project until a successor to <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> takes office. `` It's not on the verge of being resolved now anyway,'' said one administration soucre. `` We're continuing to try to clarify the conditions'' on the project set down a month ago by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators. `` It's proven to be a very difficult process.'' Although President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signaled general support for the joint venture in mid-March, Japanese officials balked at some of the conditions he stipulated _ including a guarantee that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies have a 40 percent share in the production of the new jet. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also wants assurances that any new technology developed from the project would be available to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, along with protection for U.S.-developed computer codes that help fly and control the plane. The agreement to co-develop the FSX, which stands for Fighter Support Experimental, was negotiated late last year between <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s government and the outgoing <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> adminstration. Under the agreement, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> would build the upgraded F-16 with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heavy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>. The plan encountered stiff opposition in the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, where critics have called it a $ 7 billion giveaway of high technology to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> _ suggesting the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would get little in return. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s resignation will make it `` harder to deal with the issue,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mo </LOCATION>. `` I think the position of the Japanese will be that, because they're in a difficult circumstance, they ca n't give as much as they might have on FSX,'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said in an interview. He also said that the Japanese government might use the current political turmoil there to its advantage in seeking <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concessions in other U.S.-Japanese trade disputes. Proponents of the FSX project claim it represents a way to add fighters to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s inventory in strategic northeast <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> at its own expense and would give the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> access to sophisticated radar technology developedby <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION>. One congressional source involved in trade issues said that any further delay in the project now would let <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> strengthen its negotiating hand. `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s final response on the FSX clearly had to be signed off on by the prime minister. But there was divided counsel in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> on the terms and he -LRB- <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> -RRB- obviously has been preoccupied. This will give them a chance to get their act together and play trade hardball.'' Any effort by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to demand further concessions from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could jeopardize a project that already has thin support in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, possibly torpedoing the plan entirely, said both administration and congressional sources. Traveling with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> was asked what impact <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s resignation might have on the FSX project. `` We do n't really know how it might affect that deal,'' he said. Asked if the White House still favored moving ahead with the agreement, with the new qualifications, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` Our position is the same, we still hope so.''

<HEAD>Postal Service Cuts International Mail Rates</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS 3 grafs of reax.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> slashed its price for international express mail Tuesday in an effort to increase its share of the business. Assistant Postmaster General <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eichorn </PERSON> announced that the rate for express mail packages of a half-pound or less will be $ 10.75 effective July 1. Until July 1 the agency will handle those envelopes for what he termed an `` introductory'' price of $ 8.75 each. Currently, international express mail up to one-half pound costs $ 13 to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, $ 15 to <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and $ 18 to the nearly 100 other nations where the high speed service is available. <PERSON> Eichhorn </PERSON> said that the service, which delivers parcels in one to three days, is profitable for the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and he expected the agency to do even better as volume increases. While lengthy, complex procedures are required for the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to alter its rates for domestic mail, it has the latitude to change international rates. The <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> carries about 7.4 percent of the 30 million international express parcels sent annually, <PERSON> Eichorn </PERSON> said. He predicted that volume will rise substantially with the new rates. International express mail is primarily used by businesses, although <PERSON> Eichorn </PERSON> said the lower rates will also bring it within reach of individual consumers. When expedited international mail was first offered in 1971 the rate was $ 30 plus $ 1 per ounce. The decision was immediately criticized by <ORGANIZATION> UPS </ORGANIZATION>, a competitor. <ORGANIZATION> UPS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenney </PERSON> said, `` Today's announcement by the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> that it is reducing the rate on its international express mail overnight letter to $ 8.75 and then to $ 10.75 is another incredible example of a marketing strategy designed solely to maximize postal volume at the expense of private enterprise competitors. `` How could any company faced with rising costs and disappointing productivity levels, as the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is, justify a rate cut of more than 50 per cent? The answer is simply that this service offering is not based on <ORGANIZATION> USPS </ORGANIZATION> cost factors.

At <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION>'s annual meeting Tuesday in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, shareholders elected <PERSON> Gerrit </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeelof </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Philips </ORGANIZATION> vice president and chairman of <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, as a <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION> director. The <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION> board named <PERSON> Wilhemus </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maeyer </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, as executive vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION> reported profit of $ 40.7 million, or 59 cents a share, for the first quarter, up from $ 37.1 million, or 54 cents a share, in the first quarter of 1988. Revenues for the quarter were $ 1.6 billion, up from $ 1.1 billion in the comparable 1988 period, the company said. Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitwam </PERSON> said inflation will tend to increase materials costs during the rest of the year, however. European appliance sales are expected to increase 1 percent to 3 percent this year, but a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic slowdown could reduce domestic sales 2 percent to 5 percent, he said. The board also elected <PERSON> Whitwam </PERSON> as president in addition to his posts as chairman and chief executive officer. Former president <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Suter </PERSON> resigned April 4, saying he wanted to pursue other business opportunities.

 An investment group controlled by Canadian real estate mogul <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> applied Tuesday for permission from federal regulators to acquire more than 50 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Dunkin' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Donuts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Kingsbridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> said in the filing with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> that it has already bought 7.6 percent of the stock in the doughnut maker, which owns or franchises more than 1,780 shops <LOCATION> Kingsbridge </LOCATION> announced April 20 that it had acquired 6.6 percent of <PERSON> Dunkin </PERSON>' Donuts and might seek control over the <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON>, Mass.-based company, which reported earnings of $ 13.5 million on sales of $ 112.8 million last year. The group still has not decided whether to launch a takeover bid, spokesman <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` What we're seeking is approval to acquire up to 100 percent -LRB- of <PERSON> Dunkin </PERSON>' Donuts -RRB-, but that does n't mean we're going to do it,'' he said. <PERSON> Dunkin </PERSON>' Donuts Vice President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said it would vigorously resist any takeover attempt. <ORGANIZATION> Kingsbridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> is a Toronto-based merchant bank owned by <ORGANIZATION> Unicorp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the 15th largest company in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> with assets of 5.9 billion Canadian dollars. <ORGANIZATION> Unicorp </ORGANIZATION> is controlled by <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, its chairman, who owns about 25 percent of its total stock and 68 percent of its voting shares. Under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> antitrust laws, investors must apply for permission to buy more than $ 15 million or 15 percent of the stock in large, publicly held companies. <LOCATION> Kingsbridge </LOCATION>'s purchases so far total just under $ 15 million, and <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said the group would like to exceed that figure. But he said there is `` no current intention to acquire more than 15 percent'' of <PERSON> Dunkin </PERSON>' Donuts, the threshhold that would trigger anti-takeover defenses. <PERSON> Dunkin </PERSON>' Donuts moved quickly after last week's announcement to shore up those defenses, setting up both a `` poison pill'' shareholder rights plan and an employee stock ownership plan. The poison pill would give stockholders an automatic right to purchase additional shares in the event of a takeover, significantly boosting the cost to the buyer. The <ORGANIZATION> ESOP </ORGANIZATION> would put 1.1 million shares, or about 16.7 percent of the total outstanding, into the hands of workers. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Dunkin' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Donuts </ORGANIZATION> has begun buying back an equal number of its shares, purchasing 300,000 so far this year. In addition, <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Dunkin </PERSON>' Donuts laid off 80 of its 560 employees last Friday as part of a continuing reorganization that began before the <LOCATION> Kingsbridge </LOCATION> announcement. People who work in the stores are employees of the individual franchise owners, not the company.

<TEXT>
 A federal judge on Tuesday approved a $ 764,000 settlement of criminal charges against the <ORGANIZATION> Cordis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> after the Miami-based company pleaded guilty to selling faulty pacemakers from 1983 to 1985. Last October, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> refused to accept fines and court costs totaling $ 264,000, saying the amount was `` not commensurate with the crime charged.'' But on Tuesday, he agreed to the new plea bargain after prosecutors added a $ 500,000 count. Four former <ORGANIZATION> Cordis </ORGANIZATION> officers are set to go on trial here in September on an indictment in the case, but the case Tuesday involved the company itself, which was charged separately with 12 felony and 13 misdemeanor counts. The company sold the pacemaker division in 1987. Last month in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Cordis </ORGANIZATION> also agreed to pay $ 5 million in civil penalties levied by the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` As far as the company is concerned, the issue is behind us,'' <ORGANIZATION> Cordis </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Chick </PERSON> <PERSON> McDowell </PERSON> said after Tuesday's hearing. <ORGANIZATION> Cordis </ORGANIZATION> was accused of selling 2,200 defective pacemakers and 6,000 batteries prone to corrosion from December 1983 to October 1985. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said the pacemakers could have stopped without warning, although no deaths were attributed to failure of the devices, which are implanted under the skin to regulate the heartbeat. The charges said company officials knew of the problems but sold the pacemakers anyway. <ORGANIZATION> Cordis </ORGANIZATION> sold its pacemaker business to the Australian medical device manufacturer <ORGANIZATION> Telectronics </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Cordis </ORGANIZATION> now concentrates on making catheters for diagnosing and treating heart problems and gauges for monitoring pressure on the brain. The company reported a loss of $ 56.1 million in 1987, but a major restructuring after the sale of the pacemaker operation brought the company a profit in 1988 of $ 2.4 million on sales of $ 132 million.

<TEXT>
 The Argentine currency plunged against the dollar Tuesday, continuing an 11-week slide that has cut its value by 82 percent, thrown business into disarray and threatened to spark social unrest. The government blamed speculators and uncertainty over who will win national elections set for May 14. <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> leads the candidate of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Angeloz </PERSON>, by about seven points in public opinion polls. Prices for food, clothes, gas, public utilities and consumer and business products of every type _ whether imported or not _ have soared with the dollar's value against the austral. Wages have not kept pace. <PERSON> Saul </PERSON> <PERSON> Ubaldini </PERSON>, general-secretary of the 4 million-member <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Confederation </ORGANIZATION>, calls it an `` unprecedented emergency'' and wants massive wage increases. The president of the Federation of Businesses in the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> -RRB-, <PERSON> Osvaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cornide </PERSON>, said member stores may close down Thursday to protest the economic chaos. <PERSON> Veronica </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbos </PERSON>, owner of a small leather shop, said Tuesday, `` What's happening to <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>? The exchange rate is going crazy and there's no obvious reason for it. We're helpless. It's not possible to do business in this climate.'' Argentines paid 102 australs per dollar on Tuesday, up 20 australs from the close of business Monday. Tuesday's currency devaluation of just under 20 percent followed a devaluation of almost 12 percent from Friday to Monday. The austral recovered slightly to 93 or 94 per dollar by the close of business, but was expected to open Wednesday at about 100-1. Third-party candidate <PERSON> Alvaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Alsogaray </PERSON> of the rightist <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> blames the government, which `` let the gangrene advance and now there's no other way but to cut.'' The former economy minister was referring to the huge budget deficit, triple-digit inflation and non-payment of nearly $ 59 billion in foreign debt. The national currency has slid since the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> announced on Feb. 5 it no longer would sell dollars on the open market to prop up the austral's value and dampen inflation. At the close of business on Feb. 3, Argentines could buy a dollar for 17.59 australs. Price increases touched off riots eight weeks ago that left more than 270 people dead in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s northwest coast. The consumer group <PERSON> Adelco </PERSON> said the price of flour increased by 53 percent last week, coffee by 80 percent, noodles by 52 percent, cooking oil by 43 percent. A survey by retail trade associations indicated that eggs, spaghetti, cheese, sugar and other products increased by at least 150 percent over the past nine weeks. The minimum wage is 3,500 australs a month _ about $ 35 at Tuesday's exchange rate. The dollar is a benchmark for prices and investments, given the triple-digit inflation <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> has suffered for four decades. In June 1985, the austral was worth $ 1.25. Today, it is worth about one cent. Wealthier Argentines bought dollars with their savings to hedge against inflation. Interest rates hit 80 percent a month on Tuesday as banks tried desperately to keep investors from removing deposits to buy dollars. No anti-government demonstrations or looting were reported, but police and private security guards were posted outside some supermarkets and foreign exchange houses on Tuesday as a precaution. Suppliers are delivering less goods, demanding payment sooner, and increasing financing charges. Retailers suspended credit card service and in many cases demand payment in cash. Both worry that sales of existing stock wo n't cover the cost of new merchandise. The <ORGANIZATION> Economy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it will set maximum prices on about 80 essential products, but minister <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Pugliese </PERSON> conceded, `` I can not come up with policies which will calm peoples' fears ... it is useless to insist that May 15 will follow May 14 and nothing -LRB- bad -RRB- will happen No one will believe me.'' President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>, elected in October 1983 to replace a military regime, has had little success curbing budget deficits, spurring economic growth, and making payments on <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s foreign debt

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s profit soared in the first quarter, helped by a substantial one-time gain from a major restructuring, while rising crude prices took a toll on most of the nation's other large oil companies. <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported a 22 percent drop in first-quarter earnings compared with the same 1988 period, while <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s profit was down 52 percent and <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s fell 41 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said its profit slipped 7 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> said its profit rose more than fivefold to $ 1.5 billion, or $ 5.91 a share, from $ 270 million, or $ 1.11 a share, in the first quarter of 1988. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s first-quarter results included a net restructuring gain of $ 1.2 billion, or $ 4.87 a share, the company said. The nation's third-largest oil company, based in <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, said it realized $ 1.3 billion from the sale of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> after special charges. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> sold its 78 percent stake in the <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> subsidiary to <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in January. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s revenue for the first three months of the year totaled $ 9.6 billion, up 10 percent from $ 8.7 billion in the year-ago quarter. Despite the gains, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s refining and marketing margins were hurt by rising crude oil prices in the absence of a corresponding increase in product prices, the company said. However, domestic exploration and production results benefited from the higher crude prices. <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said its first-quarter earnings fell to $ 429 million, or $ 1.04 a share, from $ 549 million, or $ 1.33 a share, in the comparable 1988 quarter. Revenue totaled $ 14 billion, up slightly from $ 13.9 billion in last year's first quarter. <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> attributed the profit decline to volatile crude prices, which resulted in a 44 percent drop in the company's refining and marketing earnings. Exploration and production earnings were off 22 percent. However, <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> predicted that a continued rise in product prices, including gasoline, could produce a turnaround in the second quarter. San Francisco-based <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> reported net income of $ 313 million, or 91 cents a share, down from $ 653 million, or $ 1.91 a share, in the same period last year. Revenue totaled $ 7.7 billion, up from $ 7.5 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Derr </PERSON> noted that crude oil in November cost about $ 13 a barrel, but had risen to $ 20 a barrel by the end of the quarter. He said prices at the gas pump did not increase fast enough to make up the difference. <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> reported after-tax profit of $ 67 million, or 24 cents a share, down sharply from $ 113 million, or 52 cents a share. Sales were $ 5.1 billion, compared with $ 4.5 billion in 1988's first quarter. The Los Angeles-based company said the 1988 results included a net gain of $ 53 million from the issuance and sale of stock by one of its subsidiaries. <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> said the first-quarter results reflected the early paydown of $ 9 million in debt as well as a lower crude oil sales volume stemming from the July 1988 North Sea Piper platform accident. <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION>, a unit of the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dutch-Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Companies </ORGANIZATION> based in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, said its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consolidated earnings in the quarter were $ 362 million, down 7 percent from $ 390 million in the year-earlier period. Revenue totaled $ 5.2 billion, up from $ 5.1 billion last year. <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings for the first quarter increased 35 percent, the <LOCATION> Radnor </LOCATION>, Pa.-based company said, citing improved results in domestic refining and marketing. Sun's profits totaled $ 81 million, or 76 cents a share, compared with $ 60 million, or 57 cents per share, in 1988's first quarter. Revenue totaled $ 2.65 billion, up from $ 2.39 billion. Excluding $ 16 million in earnings reported in the first quarter of 1988 from domestic oil and gas operations that have since been spun off to stockholders as <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exploration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Production </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings increased 84 percent.

 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> plans to announce Wednesday that it is ordering 190 narrow-body jets worth $ 7.5 billion from <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, according to a published report. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said Tuesday it would hold a news conference in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> on Wednesday to make an important announcement, but it declined to disclose its purpose.
