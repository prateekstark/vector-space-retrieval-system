 Firefighters put out a fire in a tanker car Monday night and authorities allowed 2,000 evacuees to return home for the first time since two freight trains crashed head-on and derailed. Police Chief <PERSON> Britt </PERSON> <PERSON> Adair </PERSON> said the fire was extinguished about 5 p.m. and the residents of northeast <LOCATION> Altoona </LOCATION> were allowed back in their homes about a half hour later. The two <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> trains, one of which included two tanker cars carrying as much as 20,000 gallons each of volatile denatured alcohol, collided shortly before noon Saturday. Two crewmen were killed and their bodies were recovered Monday after the last fire was out. The chief investigator said Monday the probe was centering on whether one of the trains was off schedule. Fire coming from one of the cars had burned out by Monday but authorities waited to allow residents to return because of the danger of explosion from the second tanker. Flames shot up to 20 feet over the weekend but had shrunk to about 1 -LCB- feet by Monday morning. `` If it fireballed, it would kill anything within its path for a quarter mile, with devastating effects up to a half mile, and the capability of throwing shrapnel from the cars a mile and a half. That's why we evacuated a mile and a half surrounding it,'' said <PERSON> Adair </PERSON>. `` That's with one of them exploding, and we had two burning at one time.'' Bulldozers and cranes were picking through the debris and clearing the tracks of the 86 derailed cars. `` It's a situation where one of the engines rode up over the other one in a head-on collision _ went clear up in the air _ and it just completely annihilated two engines,'' the police chief said. `` There is metal and twisted debris and wheels thrown all over the place.'' He said workers had removed about 16 hopper cars by mid-afternoon Monday and that the rail line could be open to traffic by midnight if the two tankers could be removed without problems. Investigators were trying to determine how the two trains came to be on the same track. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Dobranetski </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> investigating team, said the two surviving crewmen and other rail workers were interviewed Monday. <PERSON> Dobranetski </PERSON> said his inquiry has not determined `` whether one train left early or whether the other was running late.'' The westbound train was to have cleared the track by 11:56 a.m., while the eastbound train was n't scheduled to leave <LOCATION> Altoona </LOCATION> until 12:01 p.m., he said. Investigators examined the controls of the wrecked eastbound train and found nothing out of order, said <PERSON> Dobranetski </PERSON>. `` The emergency brake was being applied,'' he added. The crash killed <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Peers </PERSON>, 54, of <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckingham </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 35, of <LOCATION> Winterset </LOCATION>, both longtime employees of the railroad. Their bodies were located under the two derailed tankers, but had not been recovered earlier because of the danger of explosion. Rail officials said the eastbound <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bluffs-Chicago </ORGANIZATION> train was pulling 78 cars, while the westbound train was pulling eight cars from <LOCATION> Newton </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>. The two employees on the eastbound train jumped to safety before the trains collided. Both victims were on the westbound train. `` He had an obviously dangerous job. He left home thousands of times and came back thousands of times,'' said Peers' son, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>. `` This time, he did n't.'' `` They all worry about something like this happening,'' said <PERSON> Buckingham </PERSON>'s widow, <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Voy </PERSON>. `` But he was always more worried about someone else getting hurt at the crossings in a car or truck.''

 Amish farmer <PERSON> Elam </PERSON> <PERSON> Swartzentruber </PERSON> believes he has something better than electricity and technology to help him through the worst drought in more than 50 years: faith and brotherhood. <PERSON> Swartzentruber </PERSON>, better known by his Amish neighbors as `` <PERSON> Elam </PERSON> E.,'' is one of approximately 30,000 Amish residents in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, 15,000 of them involved in farming. The Amish, a <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> group formed in a split with the Mennonites in 17th century <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, believe in simplicity. They dress plainly, are forbidden to have electricity in their homes and do not use motorized equipment on their farms. It is that difference from the way `` the English'' work the land that has protected the Amish and Mennonites from financial ruin during the drought that is plaguing the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. The Mennonites also follow simple ways, but are permitted to use some modern technology. Amish and Mennonite farmers in eastern <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> say they have lost about half of this year's hay crop and have seen a marked decrease in the quality and size of their oat and corn crops. But <PERSON> Swartzentruber </PERSON>, 52, of <LOCATION> Millersburg </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Holmes </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, said he expects no long-term financial problems because he does not have the debt other farmers must repay. And he said he always pays cash for grain and seed. `` I do n't talk too good, but I farm good,'' <PERSON> Swartzentruber </PERSON> said in his thick German accent. `` This is the worst I've seen it ever, but I think it wo n't get any worse.'' He said the drought has not hurt his dairy cattle or feeder hogs and he expects to make a profit selling milk. But next year's feed prices likely will rise, making it tougher to make ends meet. `` The Amish have been hurt by the drought, but not as much as you would think,'' said <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a local expert on the people and their customs. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> left the Old Order Amish years ago but is considered a close friend and liaison by the Amish and Mennonites. They often do things in addition to farming, such as woodworking, and because they are so thrifty they have money put away for emergencies, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. `` They may look poor, but that does not necessarily mean they are,'' he said. <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a Mennonite who farms 100 acres near <LOCATION> Fredericksburg </LOCATION>, also is an auctioneer at the weekly <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hope </ORGANIZATION> farm supply sale, raises registered European Haflinger horses and sells deer hides. He said he attended a recent auction that did not end until 10 hours later than normal. `` People, including the Amish and Mennonites, were panicking, selling everything that does n't make them money,'' <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. `` But not me. My father always told me ` When everybody runs, just walk.' `` I was lucky. I bought a lot of hay in April. It was n't foresight It was just luck. But you can be sure I'm hanging on to it.'' <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, who is not related to <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, grows corn, hay and oats and raises dairy cows and hogs. He said only half of his oats and hay crops have come in. He does not hold much hope for his corn. `` I will lose a lot of money, but I _ as we all do _ have tried to operate as sharply as I could,'' said the 52-year-old farmer. <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Yoder </PERSON>, an Old Order farmer who works 95 acres near <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hope </LOCATION> with his five young sons, said the situation there is not as bad as he first thought. `` At first it looked like we were n't getting any corn, now it is looking like we're going to get half a crop,'' he said. He said his second hay cutting, which normally yields 3,500 bales, this year produced 2,600. His milk production is down as is his profit from the sale of pigs. The three farmers all said the drought will not take too large a toll on the community because they take care of each other. An Amish farmer lost his barn two weeks ago when it was hit by lightning, but <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said area Mennonite and Amish farmers were organizing a barn-raising that would not end until the barn is reconstructed.

 The flame of a white candle is blown out, and over a background of rhythmic black chanting an announcer tells viewers: `` Do n't let <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> keep the world in the dark.'' The television spot, paid for by the Canadian government, is the only state-sponsored message of its kind ever used to fight apartheid. It's being broadcast in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> as part of a `` Rekindle the Light'' festival surrounding a meeting of eight <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers that starts today and will examine ways to combat white rule in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. There's a public forum, film premiere and exhibition of photos and posters banned in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Tonight, during a jazz concert on the shores of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, thousands will be asked to light an anti-apartheid candle. Those at home are invited to put a candle in their window. `` We think we can make a difference,'' said Foreign Minister <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, referring to the dominance <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> gives to the South African issue in its foreign policy. The two-day meeting of the special committee of foreign ministers will consider: _ Canadian proposals for countering <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> African censorship and propaganda through measures including the beaming of short-wave radio broadcasts into the country from neighboring states _ A review of the effectiveness of economic sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and ways to broaden them _ A study of <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>'s international financial links, including gold sales, continued access to loans and the effects of corporate divestment from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> _ And a report by <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>'s former head of state, Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Olusegun </PERSON> <PERSON> Obasanjo </PERSON>, on the military needs of black front-line states `` There will not be dramatic progress on any question here _ it's not that kind of a meeting,'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said Monday, explaining that any recommendations must go to the entire 49-nation <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION>, which meets again in <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> next year. The foreign ministers' committee was established at the last <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> summit in <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION> in October 1987, and envoys taking part come from <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guyana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, whose colonial past links all member countries, is conspicuously absent because Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> opposes sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The British are on board, however, when it comes to military training to neighboring <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, noted <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> Shridath </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramphal </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ramphal </PERSON> said he hoped the meeting establishes `` the machinery'' for more military training. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> ruled out anything but `` non-lethal'' aid. <PERSON> Ramphal </PERSON> had reservations about Canadian proposals for countering South African news censorship. He said it was `` too one-dimensional'' to beam more news into the country, when getting news out is more urgent. `` We have not been as energetic in getting the truth out by non-conventional means and sources as the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> media has been in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>,'' he said. South African state-of-emergency regulations in effect since 1986 restrict reporting about unrest, security force actions, treatment of detainees, some forms of protest, and a broad range of statements the government considers subversive. Enforcement of the regulations has not been comprehensive. Under apartheid, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 5 million whites control the economy and government and live apart from the 26 million blacks, who have no vote in national affairs.

<TEXT>
 The shadow of unemployment hangs over the <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> shipyard in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, birthplace of the Solidarity trade union and once a showpiece of Polish industry. The trouble this time is not labor unrest, but whether the state-owned yard will keep operating in the face of mounting money problems and a government that says it is ready to begin shutting down financially ailing plants. Solidarity activists discount the possibility that the yard will shut down, but management and representatives of official worker organizations believe it is a real possiblity. A strike at the yard May 2-10, led by Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, ended without a settlement. Workers were demanding free trade unions and higher wages. During the strike, management announced that it was unable to qualify for new state subsidies or credits from the national bank, and it said the yard's future would have to be decided by the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are going on with production without a single zloty -LRB- less than a penny -RRB- in the cash box,'' the weekly newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Zycie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gospodarcze </ORGANIZATION> recently quoted shipyard director <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolwinski </PERSON> as saying. The newspaper described the yard as a `` giant on partly rotten legs.'' The shipyard is a jumbled heap of docks, aging buildings and huge cranes towering over a series of <LOCATION> Vistula </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> tributaries and canals near the heart of this centuries-old <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> port city. It will produce only 11 ships this year, down from the annual high of 27 that it made in the late 1970s. The number of workers, too, has dropped, with only about 5,000 involved in direct production. Ironically, says yard foreign trade manager <PERSON> Ireneusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Kubiczek </PERSON>, the yard could produce more ships and has customers clamoring for them. But a lack of manpower is preventing it from exploiting its physical capacity. Whether the yard makes or loses money is a debatable question because so much depends on arbitrarily set tax regulations, material costs and credit rates which fluctuate widely and are beyond the shipyard's control, said <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bukowicz </PERSON>, president of the worker's self-management council. The council's job is to help run the shipyard along with management. But in a sign of confidence, 11 hulls were launched this year in order to have work for next year, he said. Officials say the strike cost 500,000 hours of labor, which must be made up by overtime and higher productivity. Workers got pay increases June 1, but management says the increases were planned before the strike. The increases were slightly higher than the 40 percent raise the government said could be allowed in response to price increases imposed this year. Pay now averages about 50,000 zlotys -LRB- $ 111 -RRB- a month and is structured to provide incentive for harder workers, said <PERSON> Waldemar </PERSON> <PERSON> Langer </PERSON>, a leader of the yard's official trade union. Despite the improvement, the yard's main trouble is that it can not attract a sufficient work force, said <PERSON> Kubiczek </PERSON>. `` We have lost 5,000 workers from the early 1980s until now,'' he said. `` It is our own near-tragedy. We have survived the most difficult years of the crisis in shipbuilding, and now the market is reviving. And we have clients willing to place orders.'' As an example, <PERSON> Kubiczek </PERSON> cited a timber-carrying ship ordered by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The yard has been able to contract to produce only 12 of the vessels, while the Soviets need 150, he said. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is by far the yard's biggest customer. A sign inside the 343-acre facility says 575 out of 881 ships produced there have been for the Soviets. With more workers, the yard could nearly double production, <PERSON> Kubiczek </PERSON> said. But instead, workers are going to smaller private companies or cooperatives where they can make more money and work indoors. As a state-owned company, said <PERSON> Kubiczek </PERSON>, the shipyard is unable to raise wages dramatically because it would be hit with a punitive tax designed to fight wage inflation. It is one example of how national economic policies have hurt the yard, he said. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s frequently changing strategies to deal with its ailing economy have taken a toll in other ways, he said. `` At least once a year, every year, we are confronted with a new set of regulations and modifications of these rules for economic reform, while our commitments extend out many years ahead. `` It makes it practically impossible to predict whether the contract we sign today, which seems to be profitable, will in fact be practical,'' he said. One of the people who does not believe the yard will close is long-time <ORGANIZATION> Gdansk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION> activist <PERSON> Bogdan </PERSON> <PERSON> Borusewicz </PERSON>. `` First of all, someone has to build ships for the Russians. Secondly, nobody really knows whether the <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> shipyard is making profit or losing money, because the prices for materials and components, such as steel plating and engines, are not market prices really,'' he said. The yard has a history of worker militancy. In December 1970 protests over food prices, an unknown number of employees were fatally shot by security forces. A towering monument to them, erected outside the main gate, was one result of the August 1980 strike at the yard that catapulted Solidarity and <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> to worldwide fame. The inconclusive May strike showed that tensions persist, especially among younger workers. Indeed, a decision to close the yard would likely set off a new round of unrest. `` It is my firm belief that the workers themselves would not allow it,'' said <PERSON> Grzegorz </PERSON> <PERSON> Szrejder </PERSON>, a 27-year-old welder active in Solidarity.

<HEAD>Dukakis, Bush Try To Score Points on This Year's Hot Issue: Day
Care</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 With a few minutes to spare in a long campaign day, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> stopped by the Harmony Early Learning Center to shake a few hands with preschoolers. Looking to campaign on a tight preconvention budget, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a day later rode out to <ORGANIZATION> Tysons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corner </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> suburbs to do the same thing, tossing a foam ball and pushing youngsters on a tire swing. For both it was time well spent. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was rewarded with prominent photographs in newspapers and the television networks; and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> reaped similar coverage. The twin events on the presidential campaign trail last week underscored what already has become apparent to both campaigns: Child care is a hot issue in the 1988 race for the White House. It's politics dictated by demographics. The <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> says more than half of new mothers go back to work before their children are a year old. Neither party wants to find itself outmaneuvered on the issue. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the Democratic nominee, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who will become the Republican nominee in less than three weeks, have introduced competing proposals on day care. The proposals reflect their differing philosophies on government involvement, yet, importantly, both candidates support in principle some form of government initiatives to assist parents in providing care for their young children. `` We can ignore the fact that most women with small children now hold jobs, or we can work to make quality, affordable child care available to every family that needs it,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` You have to have choice, parental choice, family choice, and you have to have diversity,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. The vice president's plan is basically a $ 1,000-per-child tax break for low-income parents of children 4 and under. It would cost an estimated $ 2.2 billion a year, and in its first stages would benefit only families earning less than $ 12,000 a year, according to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> domestic affairs adviser <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Steelman </PERSON>. Eventually families earning up to $ 20,000 would benefit. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan generally would exclude the middle-class families that pay $ 100 a week or so to put a child in the centers the two presidential candidates visited last week in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' plan, according to his aides, largely is embodied in legislation now before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that is similar to day care assistance being provided in his own state of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. It is aimed at helping low - and moderate-income families afford child care, and would reserve 75 percent of its money for that aid States could use the rest to encourage developing and upgrading centers through grants. It would establish standards for care, and states would have to match a portion of the federal money. `` It is n't just that day care is n't affordable, it's that it is n't available,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Rideout </PERSON>. The legislation would cost an estimated $ 2.5 billion. But <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has stopped short of committing himself to paying that full amount, instead saying that would be only a goal. `` Until I walk into the office and take a good hard look at the books ... it's impossible to put an exact dollar figure on it,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides fault the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plan because it provides money with the filing of tax returns, not when money is spent paying day care bills. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also objects to permitting the tax credit for all who are eligible even if the family keeps the child at home, and he says <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would pile a tax break on top of his proposed cut in capital gains. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> contends, however, that offering the tax break to all families who qualify would help parents who chose to have one spouse stay at home. `` I am absolutely convinced he problem is so big and so diverse that the federal government alone can not have a bricks and mortar child care program that's going to be effective,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has drawn some large crowds in the two campaign swings he's taken since leaving <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> as the Democratic presidential nominee. Invariably, he has attracted protesters too. At virtually every stop in his campaign travels, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been confronted by demonstrators, sometimes numbering no more than a dozen, but always vocal. Most carry signs and chant slogans objecting to the right of women to have abortions. Often mixed with them are signs supporting Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and there are occasional signs attacking <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' record in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, such as the one in <LOCATION> Sturtevant </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, last week that said: `` <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the criminal's choice, go home.'' It referred to the program, since modified, allowing prison furloughs for some convicted murderers in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. The presence of anti-abortion protesters recalls the campaign in 1984 of vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>, who faced similar demonstrations at many speeches. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign staffers, many of whom are veterans of the Mondale-Ferraro effort, say they and their candidate are not bothered or surprised by the protesters. `` We expect them at every event,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' senior issues adviser who travels with the candidate The largest gathering, numbering 100 or more, confronted <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as he went to church on Sunday a week ago in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Secaucus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, last week, the dozen or so protesters positioned themselves so close behind the stage that their chants were picked up by the public address system _ and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had to walk right by them as he left. In <PERSON> Sturtevant </PERSON> a day later, a larger group chanted slogans throughout his speech, and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> appeared to have been put off his stride by the distraction. Was he rattled? `` Rattled? I did n't feel rattled. Did I look rattled? I did n't feel rattled Did I look rattled? Terribly rattled? `` Let me tell you, If you went through the kind of governorship I went through in the first four years as governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, that's a day at the beach,'' added <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. He was turned out of office after that turbulent first term, in 1978, then regained it four years later.

 The Republican National Convention should help <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> cut into <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' advantage in the public opinion polls if historical trends hold up, political analysts say. Several national political pollsters said they expected <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would enjoy a surge in the polls coming out of the Democratic National Convention, and they said that would be in keeping with past post-convention poll trends. But these experts also said that because of this tendency for candidates to get a public opinion lift from all of the exposure, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should be able to use the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> extravaganza in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> Aug. 15-18 to help his standing. While <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> could take some solace from such a boost, analysts noted that history often has shown these post-convention spurts to be short-lived. For the moment, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has a commanding lead. He was ahead by 17 percentage points in two polls last week, 18 points in two others. Survey results just before the July 18-22 convention had ranged from a dead heat to a slim <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> lead. But what would have been a remarkable surge any other week was routine by post-convention standards. Conventions traditionally boost the nominee by 10 or more points, mainly because of the intense positive exposure they provide. `` The bounce <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> got seems to be pretty typical of what we've seen in the past three elections,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugick </PERSON>, political poll chief for the <ORGANIZATION> Gallup </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. `` It would be remarkable if he did n't get a bounce.'' `` The polls are accurate. The question is, are they predictive of what will happen on election day,'' said <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Hickman </PERSON>, a Democratic pollster. `` There is no question that the race will tighten up.'' If getting the bounce is easy, keeping it is not. Gallup polls in recent elections showed convention surges settling as the campaigns progressed and voters began paying more attention to the issues: _ <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> went from a 17-percentage-point lead over President <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> before the 1976 Democratic convention to a 33-point lead after it But within a month his lead was down to 13 points, and he won in November by just 2.1 points. _ In 1980, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> went from a 3-point lead over <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> before the Republican convention to a 16-point lead after it A month later it was a tie, though <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> went on to win by 9.7 percentage points. _ In 1984, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> moved up from a 14-point deficit before the convention to a 2-point deficit just after it But <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> soon made it back, and won the election by a landslide 18.2 points. With that history in mind, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> pollster <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said he viewed the bounce more as an opportunity than an accomplishment. `` The idea is to work as hard as you can to solidify what you got from the convention,'' he said. Conversely, the bounce puts pressure on the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign to counterpunch effectively at the Republican National Convention this month. If <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> can not match <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' post-convention poll bounce, `` it certainly does not augur well for an election success,'' said <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarrance </PERSON>, a Republican pollster based in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. `` If they do n't bring enough back to cancel out that bounce from the Democrats, then they're digging themselves into a deeper hole,'' Tarrance said. `` They'll have to rely on a more negative campaign,'' a risky fall strategy that could alienate voters. The Republicans' task could be tough. <PERSON> Hickman </PERSON>, the Democratic pollster, said the nominee of the party in power often gains less of a convention boost because he generally is well known and has fewer voters to persuade. <PERSON> Hickman </PERSON> also noted another historical pattern: In eight of the past 10 presidential elections, the summertime leader went on to win. `` You're better off, if you're the candidate who's made the first good impression,'' he said.

 A pickup truck in the wrong lane collided Sunday with a van in a flaming crash that left five people dead and six critically injured in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, and six were killed in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> when a car flew out of control and crashed during a drag race, police said. Police in <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, said they were searching for a second car involved in the race about 5:50 p.m. on a one-way, two-lane corridor. In <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, five passengers of the van were dead at the scene, while the four other people in the van and both occupants of the pickup truck were critically injured, police said. The pickup was westbound in the eastbound lane at the time of the collision about 4:45 p.m., police said. The van was knocked backward off the road, then burst into flames, but passersby got four of the occupants out of the vehicle, officials said. The dead were identified as <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Becerra </PERSON>, 26, of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>; his daughter, <PERSON> Julia </PERSON>, no age available; <PERSON> Remundo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Erma </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, no ages available; and their son, <PERSON> Hermando </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, 10. Also in the van were <PERSON> Ovuula </PERSON> <PERSON> Becerra </PERSON>, 27; <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Becerra </PERSON>, 2; <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Becerra </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 1; and <PERSON> Erica </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, 7, police and hospital officials said. The occupants of the pickup were identified as driver <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, no age available, and <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Carapia </PERSON>, 20, of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. Investigators believe the Chevrolet Nova that crashed in <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> went out of control and struck a utility pole, became airborne and hit a tree before landing, officers said. Two people in the car were thrown from the vehicle when it struck the tree, and the car landed on top of them, officers said. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kokomo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, said he was working on a truck parked on the street when the vehicle that crashed missed him by about 3 feet. `` The white car came skidding down the street -LRB- and -RRB- hit the stump on the right side of the road,'' said <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>. `` He took out the pole, he hit the tree, spun around, and I saw people flying.'' The ages and the identities of those killed and the status of the one person injured were not immediately available.

 Two former Republican congressmen, including one who says that if AIDS is n't `` the wrath of God ... it should be,'' are battling for a chance to topple liberal Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>. But neither <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Huber </PERSON> has managed to generate much enthusiasm and both are financing their campaigns largely with their own money. In contrast, <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s senior senator, has $ 4 million in campaign funds, wide backing, and a 22-year record in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as he faces Tuesday's Democratic primary unopposed. <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Huber </PERSON> want to make <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>'s liberal voting record the issue, a strategy the 50-year-old <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> likes because he sees that as one of his strong points as he seeks a third six-year term. `` I think the experience that I've developed in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and some of the things we've helped accomplish _ helping the farmers -LRB- hurt by floods -RRB- two years ago, and saving <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> and saving Social Security _ these are all things where I took a leadership role and we got things done,'' he said. He also emphasizes that he's expected to become chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION>, Housing, and <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> if he is re-elected Nov. 8. <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Huber </PERSON> contend <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>'s record, including a 100 percent score in a recent voting survey by the liberal public policy group Americans for Democratic Action, means his views are n't in line with those of most <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> voters. `` He's a big spender. He's voted for cutting defense and for giving up the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>, and that turned out to be a big disaster,'' said <PERSON> Huber </PERSON>. `` He's been taking campaign funds from all over the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Those are things I think people are going to be pretty fed up with.'' A Detroit Free Press-WXYZ-TV poll released July 18 showed that of the likely <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> voters, 55 percent had n't decided which candidate they would support in the primary. That is reflected in the financing for the two campaigns. Contributions to <PERSON> Huber </PERSON>'s campaign between April 1 and July 13 totaled $ 846. He has loaned his campaign $ 221,000. <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> reported contributions of $ 39,283, and has loaned his campaign more than $ 224,000, some of which has been paid back. <PERSON> Huber </PERSON>, a conservative making his fourth try for the nomination, has portrayed himself as a staunch <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Republican. Specifically, he's for preserving federal income tax cuts, a strong defense, using more federal muscle in the war on drugs, and against abortion. AIDS came to the fore after <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> mentioned it in a radio interview last week as a subject about which he and his opponent differed. `` I take a reasonable, rational, I think very responsible approach to the problems that face this nation,'' <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> said. `` Mr. <PERSON> Huber </PERSON> has said that the reason people have AIDS is the wrath of God, punishment from God'' of homosexuals and drug users. `` <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> does not think AIDS is the wrath of God,'' he said later. <PERSON> Huber </PERSON>, asked about <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>'s remarks, said `` I do n't know whether it's the wrath of God, but if it is n't it should be.'' <PERSON> Huber </PERSON>, 65, has been the mayor of the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> suburb of Troy, a state senator and a congressman. He was defeated in a re-election bid in 1974 by now-Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, 44, an East Lansing homebuilder, holds more moderate views. During his term in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, 1981-82, <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> supported most of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s tax cut and budget reduction policies, but often opposed the administration on social issues and cuts in aid to college students. Observers favor <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> in the primary because he has the support of most of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> regulars and moderates. The Free Press-WXYZ poll found <PERSON> Huber </PERSON> ahead of <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, 26 percent to 19 percent, but <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>'s lead was within the poll's margin of error of 8.4 percentage points, and both trailed the number undecided. This portion of the July 11-13 telephone survey was conducted among 137 people who described themselves as likely Republican primary voters. Another portion of the poll found <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> had a 51 percent to 19 percent lead over either <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> or <PERSON> Huber </PERSON>, with 30 percent of the voters undecided. That survey of 598 people who described themselves as likely primary voters had a margin of error of 4 percentage points.

 <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> says his life is missing something, despite his tremendous success. `` I feel a void. There's not a total emptiness, but I feel something's missing,'' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said in an interview published in this week's People magazine. `` No matter how much you accomplish, how much money you make, or how many cars or houses you have or how many people you make happy, life is n't perfect for anybody.'' Is it romance that's missing? `` I'm in a cool place right now. I do n't have someone who is my woman,'' said <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, 27. `` I have a couple of friends. That's where I'm at right now. He finds that he and another movie star, <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallone </PERSON>, face similar problems. `` When I sit back with people like <PERSON> Stallone </PERSON>, we can trade stories,'' he said. `` It's like the same identical things happen: the way power isolates you, and everybody tries to get close to you, and the weight of being the patriarch in your family. It's just a bunch of stuff.

 Singer-songwriter <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> is still making money off the <ORGANIZATION> Monkees </ORGANIZATION> hit, `` Daydream Believer,'' which he wrote two decades ago. `` It has kept me alive,'' <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said prior to a weekend engagement here. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>'s song sold 5 million copies and became his signature tune. It also inspired a popular remake by <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> in 1980. The 49-year-old performer still tours much of the year, even though he has n't had a hit since 1979's `` Gold.'' His latest song, `` Runaway Train,'' sung by <PERSON> Rosanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Cash </PERSON>, dwells on a relationship clearly out of control. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, a former member of the <ORGANIZATION> Kingston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trio </ORGANIZATION>, has n't had much success with new material. His last album, `` Punch the Big Guy,'' was released in November and sold only 25,000 copies. He blames it on poor promotion and marketing. There may still be another hit for him, though. `` You never know,'' he said. `` No one thought ` Daydream Believer' was going to be a hit.''

 <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scorsese </PERSON> says he is troubled by the stir his forthcoming film, `` The Last Temptation of Christ,'' is creating. An alliance of conservative church groups has objected to the movie's release, with pickets, organized phone and mail protests, demonstrations and threats of a boycott. `` This film for me is like a prayer. It is my way of worshiping,'' <PERSON> Scorsese </PERSON>, whose films include `` Raging Bull'' and `` The Color of Money,'' said, according to this week's People magazine. The director told the magazine the idea of making the film touched the roots of his own spirituality and became an obsession that has dogged him throughout his career. In response to the backlash, <PERSON> Scorsese </PERSON> offers his view of the movie's message: `` It's about the last battle between God and Satan, and God wins.''

<HEAD>Japanese-American Internees To Get $20,000 Tax-Free Payments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE GOULD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is poised this week to give final approval to legislation providing more than $ 1 billion to Japanese-Americans who were forced from their homes and sent to internment camps during World War II. The House is expected to approve the bill on Wednesday, sending it to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, where President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is likely to sign it into law. If all goes according to that schedule, Japanese-Americans who qualify should start getting individual $ 20,000 tax-free payments in about a year. The most elderly will be given priority for the first payments. Enactment of the reparations bill will help end the nearly half-century-old controversy over how the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> treated its Japanese-American population after <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> attacked <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, on Dec. 7, 1941. About 120,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens and resident aliens of <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> descent were singled out _ unlike Americans of German or Italian descent _ and sent to internment camps for the duration of the war. In addition to losing their freedom, some of the internees lost jobs and possessions and were forced to sell homes at below-market prices. In the years immediately after the war, some were reimbursed for direct losses, such as impounded property. But efforts to provide an across-the-board payment were delayed for decades. In 1980, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> authorized a federal Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians to study the issue. In December 1982 it released the results of its investigation, including a recommendation that each camp survivor be given a $ 20,000 tax-free payment, providing they agree to drop all related claims against the government. Earlier this year, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> accepted the recommendations and passed separate but slightly different bills providing for the money. The differences were reconciled, and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> last week approved the compromise version without dissent. The House should do the same this week. Once approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the reparations package will go to the president for his signature. <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, deputy White House press secretary, said following <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approval that, `` They have improved the bill a lot. A lot of our concerns have been taken care of.'' One of those concerns was over how many years the government would take to make the payments. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved a five-year payout; the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> objected, claiming it would cost too much, too soon. As part of the compromise, the government now can take up to 10 years to make the payments, starting in about a year. The <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> proposal also authorizes payments of up to $ 12,000 for surviving members of the <PERSON> Aleut </PERSON> <PERSON> Indian </PERSON> tribes who were removed from the <LOCATION> Aleutian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> during the Japanese attack on those islands in 1942. `` It is most gratifying to me personally to see this long battle for personal justice come to an end at last,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Spark </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsunaga </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>, sponsor of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill. The internment camps arose from a 1942 order by President <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> that said the War Department could designate military areas from which people could be excluded. Later military orders resulted in the exclusion of all people of Japanese ancestry from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, and some in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. The orders affected 77,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens and 43,000 legal and illegal resident aliens. All were taken to prison camps in the Western states. The last camp was closed in January 1946. In all, about 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry were detained in the camps, including 77,000 American citizens. An estimated 60,000 are still alive, and the bill would allow them to claim the individual $ 20,000 payments in return for waiving any further wartime claims against the government. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> already has awarded about $ 38 million in restitution payments since the passage of a 1948 Evacuation Claims law. Five years ago, however, a federal commission estimated that Japanese-Americans had suffered losses of up to $ 2 billion that had never been compensated. About 900 Aleuts were moved from their homes and forced to live in abandoned mines, canneries and camps about 2,000 miles away. Lack of medical care and adequate food contributed to disease and death, and many of their homes were destroyed or vandalized in their absence. About 450 Aleuts survive and would be eligible for the $ 12,000 payments. Another $ 20 million would benefit Aleut villages and provide for scholarships and the general welfare of the tribe.

This spring, he delivered commencement addresses at <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mason </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, his alma mater. The only sign marking <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>'s office at the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Courthouse is a room number scratched above a door frame. And the interior of his office contains no plaques, citations or personal photographs. `` People wonder why I have such a Spartan office. I love it,'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said last week. `` Very few people find me over here, which I regard as a plus.'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, who turns 81 this fall, said he has no regrets about stepping down from the nation's highest court, even though he admits missing the intellectual challenge and the close association with other justices. `` When you reach my ancient age, family is far more important than any of the less personal things that happen to one over a long lifetime,'' he said. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Josephine </PERSON>, have four children and seven grandchildren. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> also describes his health as `` not vigorous.'' Since 1979, he has undergone several operations, including removal of a cancerous prostate in 1985. In June, he was hospitalized for almost a week for treatment of a blood infection. Although his cancer has been in remission, <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said his health prevents him and his wife of 52 years from extensive travel. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> also takes a modest view of his role on the court, although he was often seen during the 1980s as the moderate justice who kept the rest of the court from drifting too far in either direction. And last year, he was described by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> as a more powerful influence on the law than President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> or Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON>. `` If I got into a footnote, I'd be surprised,'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said.

 Yellowstone National Park officials re-opened areas of the park Sunday that had been closed because of forest fires, and firefighters used hand tools to choke the last embers of a controlled fire that destroyed 15 homes at Rapid City, S.D. Crews battled at least four new blazes in two national forests in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, a wilderness fire forced evacuation of a ranger station in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, and firefighters also were at work in the forests of <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Fire activity in <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> declined Sunday, said Costa Dillon, fire information officer. That allowed officials to re-open the park's south entrance north of <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, closed one week ago by the 10,100-acre Shoshone fire and the 10,600-acre Red fire. Officials also re-opened the park's <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Thumb </LOCATION> area Sunday, closed Saturday when firefighters started controlled burns to remove fuels before the Shoshone fire, which jumped the road from the southern entrance, could reach the area. A controlled burn on the eastern and northeastern edge of the 11,300-acre North Fork fire, which at one point was six miles from the tourist complex at Old Faithful geyser, had worked as planned and flames headed north away from the geyser Sunday, <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON> said. Firefighters completed a containment line around 30 percent of the fire and hoped for full containment by Wednesday, he added. Because the fire was caused by man rather than lightning, firefighters will attempt to control it. The largest fire in the park, the 68,035-acre Clover Mist, did not grow significantly during the weekend, <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON> said. Elsewhere in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, two new fires in the <ORGANIZATION> Bighorn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> kept firefighters busy, and crews in the <ORGANIZATION> Targhee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> fought two lightning-caused blazes. The largest had covered 1,260 acres on Medicine Mountain in the Big Horn. A timber fire that burned 3,840 acres in the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> on the western edge of <ORGANIZATION> Rapid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> over six days was declared controlled Sunday night, as was a 35-acre fire that broke out nearby Saturday. A fire is considered controlled when it is reduced to smoldering patches. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxler </PERSON>, a fire information officer, said about 584 firefighters were at the fire Sunday morning, about half the number there 24 hours earlier. The remaining firefighters worked from the fire line to the center of the burned area with hand tools and other equipment, <PERSON> Waxler </PERSON> said. `` Basically, they're doing things like extinguishing embers and turning over logs to make sure that things are out,'' she said. The Rock Creek fire in the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness Area of southwestern <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> jumped fire lines and covered about 3,000 acres Sunday, said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kendley </PERSON>, fire information officer at the <ORGANIZATION> Inter-Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dispatch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Helena </LOCATION>. Although it was in a wilderness area, the fire was being fought because it was man-caused. Late Saturday, smoke from the fire could be seen in <LOCATION> Helena </LOCATION>, more than 100 miles away, he said. In northwestern <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, 10 to 15 people were evacuated from a remote ranger station in the <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> Wilderness Area when the Gates fire spread to about 8,000 acres, <PERSON> Kendley </PERSON> said. `` That fire increased 2,000 to 3,000 acres in size'' on Saturday, <PERSON> Kendley </PERSON> said. `` The buildings -LRB- at the station -RRB- have been covered with fireproof tarps, a gravity-feed sprinkler system has been installed on a nearby ridge and personnel and livestock have been evacuated from the station.'' Also in the <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> blaze had grown to 15,000 acres Sunday, he said. In <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, ground crews cleared landing areas for helicopters around the 5,000-acre <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gulch </PERSON> fire so weary firefighters can be flown back and forth from the remote fire line in the <ORGANIZATION> Boise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. The heliports cut the walk for firefighters from four miles to about a half mile. Containment was expected Monday evening, and by late Sunday a containment line had been thrown around 90 percent of the fire's 10-mile perimeter, forest officials said Firefighters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> continued work Sunday on the 3,600-acre <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> fire along the crest of the <LOCATION> Cascades </LOCATION>, about 12 miles northeast of Mount Rainier National Park, and a smaller burn in the Cascade foothills. A 75-acre fire broke out late Saturday in the <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and and a lightning storm sparked nearly 70 small fires in southern <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, forest spokeswomen said.

 Lt. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Rossano </PERSON>, one of 13 city sanitation cops, sifts through syringes, blood vials and other disgusting debris, hunting for the culprit who's dumping the infectious medical waste tainting beaches in five states. `` It's like the detective work on a murder case,'' <PERSON> Rossano </PERSON> said. `` We're doing interviews, surveillance, followup, just good old-fashioned police work. We trace every marked item we can.'' These gumshoes of garbage look for names, dates and places so they can zero in on the offending source. But most of the seaborne slop, carried by the whims of tides, currents and winds, either has no markings or waterlogged labels are unreadable. More than 1,000 items of medical waste, most of it syringes used to inject insulin or illegal drugs, have been bagged in an evidence trailer. Under particular scrutiny are people who were caught dumping before. `` There's reason to believe we can identify the bad actors who are illegally dumping,'' said <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sexton </PERSON>, head of the city's <ORGANIZATION> Sanitation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> `` It looks like repeated dumping by a smaller user,'' said <PERSON> Marlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Gold </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Sanitation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s enforcement team of five lawyers, 13 environmental sleuths and 10 extra officers. `` I do n't think we're looking at large hospitals. There's no indication of wholesale dumping,'' she said. `` It's just very hard to reconstruct what must have happened. It's very hard to trace this material. We're looking for people who have no regard for the way they handle waste.'' State and federal authorities are also part of the investigation. This summer's floating filth first came ashore July 6 on a <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> beach. Also contaminated are beaches in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. The refuse is mostly unmarked needles and vials, several of which tested positive for AIDS antibodies and hepatitis B virus. Other items included stained bandages, catheter bags, colostomy bags, respirator parts, prescription bottles, plastic tubing for intravenous drugs, rubber gloves and nine dead rats. Infectious medical wastes, treated like industrial trash, are supposed to be placed in red bags to alert handlers of the contents. No red bags have washed ashore. State investigators believe the rubbish may have come from several sources: illegal dumpers, runoff from city storm sewers, wind-swept garbage barges or sloppy handling of trash at city landfills. `` The evidence does not point to a single incident or a single event as a ` smoking gun,''' said R.W. <PERSON> Groneman </PERSON>, spokesman for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION>, which has 10 environmental police on the case. `` It's a big ocean,'' <PERSON> Groneman </PERSON> said. `` The midnight dumpers, the people who might deliberately dump this stuff, do n't necessarily leave calling cards or identifying marks.'' <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> generates 1.8 million pounds of red bag waste each week, 45 percent of which comes from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Most of it is incinerated on the spot or taken out of state for disposal. <PERSON> Groneman </PERSON> said the items scoured from hundreds of miles of beaches would fill six shopping bags. `` We're not talking about wave upon wave of red bag waste,'' he said. <PERSON> Groneman </PERSON> says that needles flushed down toilets by diabetics and junkies may have been carried out to sea during a heavy rain that overloaded the city's sewers. Other officials say beach debris may be inevitable. `` From this whole episode, we now understand that needles on the beach are part of the ecology of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Health Commissioner. Some seemingly promising clues have washed out. A prescription bottle was traced to an upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> man, and hopeful authorities thought they could find who handled his trash. But the man said he lost his pills on a fishing trip at sea. `` You get very excited when you see something with markings on it. You figure you can trace it and get to the bottom of this thing. But there are a lot of false leads,'' said Gold. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyko </PERSON> heads a team of 13 lawyers and 25 investigators who drive along back roads trailing garbage trucks, videotaping work at garbage transfer stations and combing through litter. `` We are going to nail people for deliberate dumping,'' said <PERSON> Lyko </PERSON>, head of the state's task force on environmental protection. Ocean experts say the trash may have washed out to sea from any number of inlets, then sloshed back to a different shore. `` The tides along the <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seaboard </LOCATION> carry things in and out. Once it goes out, it mixes. You do n't know which inlet it came from,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>. `` Winds, currents, rain and tide all impact on what's moving in and out.'' In <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, authorities say they have no doubt where unwelcome litter originated. They had 75 pieces of trash, including a prescription bottle from a woman in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> and a sign they believe belongs to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rhode </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> computer model of winds, currents and tides during the last 30 days indicated the garbage came from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> DiOrio </PERSON>, an aide to Gov. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON>. `` It is all leading us back to the same general area _ <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> DiOrio </PERSON>, head of the state's <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> on Medical Wastes. `` This is a great warning to all of us. We better be aggressive in protecting our shoreline.''

<TEXT>
 Gazing up at the sheer limestone north face of the Eiger, mountaineer <PERSON> Heinrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrer </PERSON> reminisced about the climb 50 years ago that changed his life. In July 1938, he and three other climbers became the first to scale the daunting 5,940-foot wall in the heart of the <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alps </LOCATION> that is considered <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s greatest challenge to mountaineers. `` We were never afraid. We never had any idea of returning or giving up'' despite difficulties during the four-day adventure, the 76-year-old <PERSON> Harrer </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a recent interview. Nine people had already died on the wall before <PERSON> Harrer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fritz </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasparek </PERSON>, both Austrians, and <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Heckmair </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ludwig </PERSON> <PERSON> Voerg </PERSON>, both Germans, set out before dawn one morning to conquer the last virgin face of the <LOCATION> Alps </LOCATION>. Because of the danger, authorities had outlawed attempts to climb the north face. But the four defied the ban. `` We climbed the wall secretly,'' said <PERSON> Harrer </PERSON>, sitting in an Alpine meadow with a dramatic view of the north face. `` When we came down after four days, we were surprised to find out that the whole world knew about it.'' It turned out that observers had spotted them. <PERSON> Harrer </PERSON> recently returned to <LOCATION> Grindelwald </LOCATION>, a village at the base of the Eiger, for a weekend celebration with hundreds of other mountaineers and fans on the anniversary of the climb. Another guest of honor was 82-year-old Heckmair. <PERSON> Kasparek </PERSON> and <PERSON> Voerg </PERSON> are both dead. The Eiger north face, which juts up almost vertically above <LOCATION> Grindelwald </LOCATION>, lived up to its reputation that celebration weekend. An English climber trying to scale it fell and sustained serious head injuries, but was rescued alive by helicopter. Just Saturday, a 26-year-old South Korean was killed in a 3,300-foot fall as he tried to scale the Eiger's north face, the <ORGANIZATION> Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. The recent helicopter rescue recalled the most dramatic rescue from the Eiger, the first time a climber was rescued alive. In 1957, before helicopters were used, Italian <PERSON> Claudio </PERSON> <PERSON> Corti </PERSON> was saved at an icy patch three-quarters of the way up the wall. But his countryman <PERSON> Stefano </PERSON> <PERSON> Longhi </PERSON> froze to death and his body hung from his rope, out of reach of rescuers, for two years. It was only when winches were put in place in 1959 that the corpse could be retrieved. <PERSON> Harrer </PERSON> said that after 50 years, public interest in the Eiger and the historic first climb has actually increased. `` This wall has developed a certain kind of charisma, a mythical attraction,'' he says. Since the 1938 climb, about 700 mountaineers have successfully ascended the wall using various routes to get to the peak 13,101 feet above sea level. <PERSON> Harrer </PERSON> said the fact that so many have climbed the north face does not diminish the challenge. `` Fifty people have died on that wall, which proves that the wall has n't become easier,'' he said. But he added, `` it has become easier provided you are an expert, provided you are equipped properly, provided you have prepared this climb and chosen the proper time to do it.'' In a book he wrote about his ascent, <PERSON> Harrer </PERSON> tells how he and his partners waited for days, watching the weather around the Eiger, before picking the best moment to begin their climb. The climbers nourished themselves mostly with hot tea and cocoa. <PERSON> Harrer </PERSON> said his only solid food during the climb was a slice of bread and butter that his mother had given him 14 days earlier, as he left home after taking his university exams. `` I did n't tell her where I was going, just that I was going climbing,'' he said. The most tense moments of the 1938 climb came on the third day, when the mountaineers clung to the nearly vertical face to withstand avalanches, hailstorms and snowstorms. `` This is part of the Eiger north wall,'' <PERSON> Harrer </PERSON> said. He said he was not afraid. `` Once you start action, you are on the wall, you never think of any danger.'' Yet he said that before reaching the wall, one always has `` some thoughts that you could return now, it is not too late.'' `` But it's very simple. If you do n't overcome fear, you will never be prepared to do something exceptional.''

 Heavy weekend rains sent a river over its banks and triggered a mudslide that destroyed nearly 100 houses in a coastal resort and left two people dead and 12 missing, officials said. The Chichiriviche river overflowed after a downpour Saturday night, causing a mudslide that covered several of the houses `` up to their roofs,'' civilian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Freddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Paris </PERSON> told the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Venpres </ORGANIZATION>. `` There is mud up to five meters -LRB- yards -RRB- high. It is likely there are more victims in there and we are working to find those missing,'' he said Sunday. <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> said the houses belonged to people vacationing in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> resort 25 miles north of <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guaira </LOCATION> port. The flooding was the worst since last September, when a mudslide caused by a downpour in another coastal area killed hundreds of vacationers.

<HEAD>Forest Fires Are Essential to Natural Diversity</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Forest fires, even the big ones that hit <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> last week, are an essential part of nature's cycle of death and renewal. Humans unwittingly rearranged a lot of nature's handiwork before realizing that. `` We almost lost the loblolly pine'' in the Southeast in the 1920s and 1930s because of the insistence of the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in suppressing all fires, says <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, a wildlife ecologists at <ORGANIZATION> Auburn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Such a no-fire policy lets hardwood species get established, and once established the hardwoods can out-compete the pine, <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said. Traditionally, lightning or Indians, who set fires for hunting or farming, would always start enough fires to keep hardwoods down, he said. When <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> was settled around 1830, two-thirds of the state was prairie, one-third forest. Humans fought prairie fires. Now the state is two-thirds forest, with special organizations trying to save the prairie chicken _ and setting fires to keep the prairie vigorous. Though specifics differ according to soils, weather and species _ fire has been far more important in forest evolution in the arid West than elsewhere _ natural fires caused by lightning are usually small. Without harming trees very much they prevent litter from leaves, dead limbs, twigs and other organic matter from building up. Fire `` recycles the nutrients and you get a diversity of wildlife species,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillette </PERSON>, deputy regional director of the <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. His agency probably sets 400 fires a year, ranging from 100 acres to 2,000, acres on its 443 refuges and other installations. In some ecosystems, rigid suppression of natural fires means enormous amounts of fuel can accumulate on the forest floor. When the inevitable lightning does strike, the fire can be impossible to suppress and more destructive than anything that would have happened naturally. In some areas like the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION>, damp soils kept fires from getting started on the forest floor. When a fire would start in a dry cycle, maybe once a century, it would spread to the crowns and sweep all before it. `` You have selection for species that can recover,'' said <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>. `` It takes a long, long time.'' A fire in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> sequoia tree crowns in 1955, where the floor normally would burn every decade or so, prompted a re-examination of the `` fight every fire'' policy by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. By 1968 the service was igniting the undercover in the Sequoia National Park, trying to return the forest to its natural state. In 1972 it adopted what has been called a `` let burn'' policy. `` We were almost killing the trees with kindness,'' before that, said Chief <PERSON> Ranger </PERSON> <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Dabney </PERSON>. The new policy had been long germinating from research dating to the 1930s, said <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, some of whose research helped spread the gospel. `` A lot of the old foresters and game wardens could have tarred and feathered me,'' he said. Strictly speaking, `` let burn'' is a misnomer. <PERSON> Dabney </PERSON> said the policy always contemplated case-by-case decisions. Fires that threaten structures are always fought. Fires that might be left alone would be fought if they could spread outside the park, into commercial timbering, for example. The use of fire by humans is exactly analogous to the use of human hunters to replace a predator and maintain nature's balance, <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> said. Last week's fires in <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>, which involved about 5 percent of the park's acreage, were of a severity seen only once every 200 years to 400 years or so. Instead of fighting only blazes threatening park installations, firefighters turned to attacking almost every outbreak before waiting to see what it might threaten _ it might be too late to put down the fire when its course became clear, and it takes far fewer fighters to do that early. A big fire does more than clear the floor; it opens the forest. Sunlight reaches the ground. Creatures like owls appear, living in forest but doing their hunting in the open area. Some tree species need fire to burst cones and scatter seeds. Seeds germinate into fledgling trees. In <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, elk have nothing to eat in the mature forest, but will graze on the growth in the open area. `` In a couple of years you'll see a green situation, with food for the elk,'' <PERSON> Cutler </PERSON> said. Examples could be multiplied _ in northern <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, blueberry bushes appear after fires. Bears like blueberries, so more bears appear. Eventually, something else succeeds the blueberry bushes, and the bears decline. The difficulty with a `` let-burn'' policy is the exceptions, <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> noted: `` Someone will always say: I realize -LRB- the policy -RRB-, but we ca n't let this one burn. ... It would be nice if these things all started two-thirds of the way up to the mountain and just burned their way to the top, but they do n't.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A 4-year-old <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy of giving trade preference to small <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> nations has helped turn American supermarket produce counters into exotic garden spots where pineapples, melons and other fruit are in abundant supply. The Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act of 1983 gave 27 countries duty-free access to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> markets for 12 years, beginning in 1984. An <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report takes a look at the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION> Initiative, or <ORGANIZATION> CBI </ORGANIZATION>, and concludes that its impact on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imports of 75 horticultural products has been mixed, with some notable successes and some failures. The report said <ORGANIZATION> CBI </ORGANIZATION> `` improved the competitive position of all but a few products that were specifically excluded,'' such as selected textiles, leather goods, canned tuna, crude and refined petroleum products and watch parts. After <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed the law in 1983, the report said, there was `` a wave of optimism'' that led to a search for new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market opportunities, with producers looking specifically at growth potential for horticultural products. The value of horticultural products imported from <ORGANIZATION> CBI </ORGANIZATION> countries rose to $ 666 million in 1987 from $ 459 million in 1983, a 45 percent increase. When bananas, beer and ale are excluded, the imports of remaining products more than doubled to $ 191.2 million from $ 91.1 million. Fresh pineapples accounted for about 12 percent of the $ 191.2 million in import value over the four years, the report said. Other commodities included: frozen concentrated orange juice, 5.1 percent; cantaloupes, 4.3 percent; other melons, mostly honeydews, 7.1 percent; mangoes, 2.5 percent; and frozen broccoli, 4.8 percent. The 75 products reviewed accounted for about half the $ 191.2 million, the report said. Products not among the 75, but still important as <ORGANIZATION> CBI </ORGANIZATION> exports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, included live plants, peas, yams, sweet potatoes and dasheens, or taro. The analysis was prepared by economists <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Buxton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and was included in the August issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine. Nine products from the <ORGANIZATION> CBI </ORGANIZATION> countries showed strong gains after 1983. Exports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of pineapples, cantaloupes and other melons increased to more than 6,000 metric tons per through 1987. The <ORGANIZATION> CBI </ORGANIZATION> share of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pineapple imports, for example, increased to 97 percent in 1987 from 57 percent in 1983. Other melons increased to 45 percent from 24 percent, and cantaloupes to 21 percent from 7 percent. `` <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> were the principal sources of fresh pineapples, while <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> were the big gainers for cantaloupe and honeydew exports,'' the report said. `` Also showing strong gains were frozen broccoli, fresh celery, onions and roses -LRB- largely from <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> -RRB-, frozen concentrated orange juice -LRB- mostly from <LOCATION> Belize </LOCATION> -RRB- and fresh okra from the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>.'' A category of `` medium gainers'' among 1983-87 imports from <ORGANIZATION> CBI </ORGANIZATION> countries included watermelons, frozen strawberries and fresh strawberries from <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>; grapefruit from the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>; mangos from <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>; and coconut meat from the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. The Bahamas now account for 99 percent of the grapefruit imported from <ORGANIZATION> CBI </ORGANIZATION> countries, the report said. Even so, total imports account for less than 1 percent of the annual <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grapefruit supply. Products said to show `` weak gains'' since 1983 included tomatoes, which increased almost 1,800 metric tons annually but were only about 1 percent of the total volume of tomatoes imported by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year. Nearly all the <ORGANIZATION> CBI </ORGANIZATION> tomatoes came from the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. Lemon imports from the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> grew about 600 tons annually and accounted for 16 percent of total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> lemon imports in 1987, up from only 1 percent in 1983, the report said. Other products showing weak gains were pineapple juice concentrate, frozen peas, squash, garlic and peppers. The report said products in the `` loser'' category _ meaning imports from the <ORGANIZATION> CBI </ORGANIZATION> countries declined _ included green beans, cucumbers, eggplant, frozen cauliflower and frozen okra. `` Duty-free status does not ensure success for <ORGANIZATION> CBI </ORGANIZATION> products in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> markets,'' the report said. `` Strong competition exists from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> for many fresh vegetables, and from <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> and other <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION> countries for fresh fruits and juices.'' The report added: `` Competing with other regions by delivering fresh, high-quality fruits and vegetables to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> markets involves developing a closely coordinated production, processing, transportation and distribution network.'' Much time and relatively large investments are needed to plan, develop and carry out new ventures in regions such as the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> `` where social, political and geographic handicaps, as well as years of colonial neglect, have hindered the development of dynamic and self-sustaining market economies,'' the report said. But growth in the export capability of <ORGANIZATION> CBI </ORGANIZATION> countries has begun and probably will continue, the report said, adding that `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has already hinted it might extend the <ORGANIZATION> CBI </ORGANIZATION> beyond the first 12-year period to provide a longer planning horizon and investment recovery period.''

<HEAD>Study: Stress of Jobs With Low Control Can Kill</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Waiters, cashiers and others with little control over demanding jobs face an added heart attack risk about as big as that from smoking or high cholesterol, a study of nearly 5,000 men suggests. The study found that male workers in the top 10 percent for such `` job strain'' had 3.8 to 4.8 times the heart attack risk of men in the bottom 10 percent. A second analysis found that men in the top 20 percent for job strain, a list that included cooks, gas station attendants and firemen, had 2.5 to 3.3 times the risk of the rest of the workers studied. Each analysis gave two numbers because it was performed on two groups of men. The `` true'' answer probably lies about halfway in between, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Karasek </PERSON>, associate professor in the industrial and systems engineering department at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>. Employers may be able to redesign high-strain jobs to lower heart attack risk and improve productivity, said <PERSON> Karasek </PERSON>. <PERSON> Karasek </PERSON> reports the study in August's <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, along with co-authors from <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Stony </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. The results are impressive, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Krantz </PERSON>, professor of medical psychology at the <ORGANIZATION> Uniformed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, Md. Job strain was defined as the result of having too little control over one's work to deal satisfactorily with its psychological demands, such as having to work quickly and facing heavy workloads. Executives were not considered under heavy strain because they have control to deal with demands, <PERSON> Karasek </PERSON> said. The study was based on heart attacks as reported by men in two federal surveys. Too few women with heart attacks appeared in those surveys for a meaningful analysis of them, <PERSON> Karasek </PERSON> said. The Health Examination Survey done in 1960-61, found 39 heart attacks among 2,409 employed men. The Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, done from 1971 to 1975, uncovered 30 heart attacks among 2,424 employed men. To assess job characteristics for all 4,833 men, researchers used federal studies of the conditions faced by workers of various kinds of jobs. Measurements for various job traits, such as control over the work, were computed for 221 occupations. These measurements were then adjusted for each worker based on his age, race, education, geographic region, and whether or not he was self-employed or worked in a city. The comparison of heart attacks in men with the most versus the least job strain took into account the heart attack risk factors of age, race, cigarette use, education, blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Jobs in the top 10 percent for strain included cashiers and waiters, while those in the bottom 10 percent included foresters, natural scientists and civil engineers. The other analysis, of men in the top 20 percent versus the other 80 percent, took into account only the worker ages, which <PERSON> Karasek </PERSON> said was the most important influence on heart attack risk. Job strain appeared to account for between a fourth and a third of heart attacks in an analysis that took only age into account. <PERSON> Karasek </PERSON> said the results were similar when the other risk factors also were considered. The study does not prove that job strain raises the risk of heart attacks, <PERSON> Karasek </PERSON> said, but the idea is supported by other research. In the new study, researchers did not know whether workers were in their reported jobs when the heart attack occurred. But it is unlikely that a worker would have a heart attack in a low-strain job and later move into a high-strain one, <PERSON> Karasek </PERSON> said. It may take 10 to 15 years of high job strain before a heart attack would occur, he said. Giving workers more control has long been advocated to increase productivity, he said. It may also reduce job strain, along with letting workers use underutilized skills and making their jobs platforms for learning new skills, he said. <PERSON> Karasek </PERSON> said overall job strain probably includes factors the study overlooked, such as job insecurity and psychological support from other people. <PERSON> Krantz </PERSON> said the `` very promising'' job strain hypothesis should be tested by research that measures each worker's job strain directly, follows him over time and takes the various risk factors into account.

 Blacks are underrepresented in the cockpits and corporate offices of the nation's airlines, according to a congressional report that says air carriers actually may be going backwards in their affirmative action efforts. Blacks hold about 5 percent of the managerial jobs at the airlines, and no more than 200 of the 45,000 pilots in the industry are black, said the report released Sunday by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` Blacks are making little progress in the airline industry overall and, at certain airlines have actually regressed,'' Rep. <PERSON> Cardiss </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, D-Ill., chairwoman of the panel's subcommittee on transportation, said The report said blacks represent 30 percent of the industry's unskilled workers However, they constitute less than 2 percent of all airline professionals, it said. The report caps an investigation by the subcommittee that included three hearings and a review of records maintained by federal agencies as well as company documents on minority hiring and promotion. The panel said the report, in particular, discusses equal employment opportunity and affirmative action policies and practices at <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. `` The testimony and documents received by the subcommittee suggest that the airline industry has downgraded affirmative action efforts, particularly with respect to black pilots, managers and other professionals,'' the report said. It said civil rights laws, court rulings and other factors had brought a measure of integration to the airlines. But it added that `` the industry pattern is one in which blacks continue to be overrepresented in low-wage, semiskilled and unskilled positions and continue to be underrepresented in positions requiring advanced education, specialized training and skill.'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, an industry trade group, said in an interview Sunday, `` All of the major airlines have positive minority hiring programs. There has a lot of considerable progress made in the last 10 years. Since 1978, the number of blacks and Hispanics has increased 30 percent. And women constitute 40 percent of all airline employees.'' The report said one problem appeared to be `` an old boy network, wherein whites, white males in particular, are favored in hiring and promotion decisions.'' It said another was that black employees are often placed in jobs outside the mainstream and thus are among the first to go when there are layoffs. It also acknowledged that flux within the industry caused by mergers and deregulation have played a part. And it said some of the problem is traceable to union seniority rules, competition with other industries for skilled black workers and lack of equal educational opportunities. The report recommended that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> take a more active role in monitoring the industry for affirmative action compliance. It also called for an in-depth review of hiring practices by the <ORGANIZATION> Equal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Nine of the committee's 15 Republicans, however, said in dissenting views attached to the report it was neither `` necessary nor advisable that the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> once again be given a role in overseeing affirmative action within the commercial airline industry.'' It said there were many reasons for the low percentages of minority employees in top airline jobs and added that failure to give those causes due weight while stressing affirmative action problems `` potentially distorts rather than clarifies the airlines' record. `` In addition, and perhaps most importantly, the <ORGANIZATION> Equal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the agency charged with enforcing our most important anti-discrimination laws, has found no evidence nor indication that the airline industry's record on affirmative action ... is unique or different from any other industry,'' the nine said.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> says he's willing to meet with his Iranian counterpart to discuss an end to the Iran-Iraq war, terrorism and hostage-taking but not the return of Iranian assets <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials are trying to find `` an authoritative channel'' for direct talks with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, but he has not sought a meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> during the Iranian official's visit to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> for peace talks, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. `` We do n't have to go running around after people,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said Sunday on <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Face the Nation.'' But he added, `` It's important to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to have a relationship with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and that will emerge in due time. Asked if he would meet with <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> if such a meeting were requested, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> replied, `` Sure,'' adding, `` I do n't know that it's necessarily the right way to start, to have the foreign ministers meet, but at any rate we have stated our policy.'' He indicated the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> continues to make contacts with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> through third countries and said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have repeatedly expressed a willingness to hold direct talks on `` what it takes for them to become part of the civilized community.'' He said if <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> will stop the war, stop being involved in terrorism and stop promoting the taking of hostages, then `` there is a prospect of more normal relations with us.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said the issue of releasing nine Americans held by pro-Iranian groups in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> would have to be separate from financial and other considerations. He noted that the issue of releasing Iranian assets held by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is being handled by a claims tribunal court in The Hague and `` there is no reason to disrupt it.'' Iranian officials have suggested they might work for release of the hostages if the assets are returned, but <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials have said they will make no such deal.

 Insisting Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> used his <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> post as a cover to spy for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, a pro-Iranian extremist group rejected a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> appeal for the American hostage's release. <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Mousawi </PERSON>, a senior leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, said Sunday that the group considers the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolution `` part of a plot against the Moslems and <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- holy warriors -RRB- of this area.'' `` We consider the arrest of this agent by the sons of this nation as part of its defense of its dignity and existence,'' <PERSON> Mousawi </PERSON> said at a rally in the southeastern town of <LOCATION> Mashgara </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> is believed to be an umbrella group for <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> factions holding most of the 18 foreign hostages, including nine Americans, in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mousawi </PERSON>'s speech was the first <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> reply to resolution passed unanimously Friday by the 15-nation <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> condemning the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION>'s abduction and pleading for his immediate release. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, 43, of <LOCATION> Danville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, was chief of a 76-member observer group attached to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> when he was abducted Feb. 17. The <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran also served as an aide to former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> has publicly defended the Organization of the Oppressed on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, which claimed responsibility for <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' abduction `` Everyone knows that when <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was seized by the oppressed in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> he was n't on a humanitarian mission, but, according to even the American press and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, he was engaged in a spying mission on <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Mousawi </PERSON>. There is no record of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> making such a statement. `` So it is within our right to say that the presence of <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> under the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> umbrella in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> is part of a war waged by this arrogant body and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the great Satan, against our oppressed people,'' <PERSON> Mousawi </PERSON> said. His oration drew thunderous chants of `` Death to the Great Satan!'' and `` No to the Security Council!'' from thousands of fist-shaking Shiite Moslem zealots attending the rally. The Organization of the Oppressed on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> has repeatedly charged that <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was a spy for the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials deny it.

Christian militiamen kidnapped the Iranians in July 1982. There have been reports that they were killed, and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has been seeking word on them.

 A leak developed Sunday in Discovery's fuel lines, halting the loading of fuel and raising the possibility of another postponement of a test firing of the space shuttle's engines, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said. The leak occurred as crews were filling the external fuel tanks with liquid hydrogen and oxygen, said <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Buck </PERSON>. `` We're trouble-shooting the liquid hydrogen leak and looking to see if we will be able to continue filling the tank to completion right now,'' she said early Monday. Earlier Sunday, a two-part countdown resumed for the test-firing of Discovery's engines after engineers repaired a hydrogen leak and a balky oxygen pump. The problems that cropped up Friday had caused the fourth postponement in 10 days for the test, which is considered critical to certifying Discovery for the first shuttle flight since the Challenger disaster. The leak and pump were repaired Saturday, and the test-firing is now scheduled to take place Thursday. Officials believe the delays, combined with an unresolved leak in Discovery's steering engine system, will slip the launch date from mid-September into October. The leak and pump problems developed Friday soon after technicians began pouring more than half a million gallons of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellant into the spaceship's external fuel tank on Launch Pad 39B It was the first attempt to fuel a space shuttle since Challenger exploded on Jan. 28, 1986, killing the crew of seven. The exercise leading to the firing of the three main engines, with Discovery bolted firmly on the launch pad, is divided into two parts. The first part involved fully fueling the tank and simulating a problem that forces a postponement with the countdown at 10 seconds before a mock liftoff. That was to take place Monday. The launch team then was to empty the tank, restart the countdown, refill the tank and aim for a 20-second ignition of the engines at 7:30 a.m. Thursday. The purpose of the overall test is to check several modifications made to the engines and launch pad since the Challenger accident and to provide countdown practice for the launch team. When the test is completed, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> still must cope with the small gas leak in a steering engine system that is separate from the main engines. Engineers have come up with a plan to reach and repair the leak by entering Discovery's cargo bay and cutting a hole through the rear bulkhead into the steering engine compartment. Another option, with a decision to be made after the test-firing, is to take Discovery off the launch pad and back to a hangar for repair, a move that could postpone the launch until November.

The negotiations deadlocked Saturday after an 11-hour session. `` We've simply gotten to the end of the road, and we've hit a brick wall,'' <PERSON> Counter </PERSON> said of the 217-member alliance. `` We will redouble our efforts to produce as many programs as possible.'' The major unresolved issue is how much the writers should get from sale of TV shows and movies abroad and from domestic TV reruns. The strike, which began March 7, has left the fall television season in chaos and has led to financial hardship for many of the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>'s 9,000 members, as well as entertainment-related industries. Counter said production companies belonging to the alliance would welcome strike-breaking union members and likely would offer financial protection against any union reprisal. Guild officials have said writers who go back to work risk fines of up to 110 percent of their compensation from the producers and expulsion from the union. About 50 guild members, meanwhile, singled out <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday by picketing movie theaters in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Westwood </LOCATION> showing the hit <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> film `` Who Framed <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabbit </PERSON>.'' The demonstrators blamed Disney for blocking a tentative settlement with the alliance, and held signs and passed out fliers saying `` Who framed the writers guild?'' and `` <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouse </PERSON> is stealing from our kids.'' <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> called the demonstrations `` public outrage pickets,'' and said more would be planned this week here and in other parts of the country. She called prospects of a fall TV season `` doubtful and improbable. They may put a few shows on the air, but it will not be a full schedule.'' The strike is only a week short of the entertainment's industry's longest _ a 23-week walkout by the guild in 1960 That strike won writers payments for television reruns. Also Sunday, Counter and <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, chairman of the basic crafts unions, issued a joint statement Sunday saying the alliance and behind-the-scenes workers agreed to extend their contracts on a day-to-day basis. Those contracts were to have expired at midnight. `` The parties will resume discussions on Wednesday ... with the expectation of negotiating to conclusion,'' the statement said.

<HEAD>Heading Off Foreign Policy Squabbles: Experts Tell How</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new president should move quickly to fill foreign policy posts and make clear immediately that his secretary of state is his `` one principal lieutenant'' in foreign affairs, a report on presidential transition recommends. The report noted that Presidents <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` all found their administrations involved early in internal disputes between the national security adviser and the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>.'' The report never mentioned the Iran-Contra affair, which came to light in President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s second term. But it said `` recent events'' have demonstrated the need for a new president to tell his national security adviser `` at the start precisely what role and responsibilities'' he and his staff should assume, `` including their relations with the secretary of state. `` Coherence and consistency in foreign policy are best served if the president has only one principal lieutenant in that area, the secretary of state.'' The report, entitled `` Transferring Responsibility: The Dangers of Transition,'' was released by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burkett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> of Public Affairs at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION>. The study was the work of a Commission On Presidential Transitions and Foreign Policy headed by former secretaries of state <PERSON> Cyrus </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>. The commission included members of every post-war presidential transition, from the <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt-Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> changeover to that of <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Rogers-Vance </ORGANIZATION> commission recommended: _ Key foreign policy officials should be selected promptly by a new administration, with Cabinet officers chosen within four weeks of the election and sub-Cabinet positions filled within 10 weeks The process often takes longer, the report said, because of political considerations in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. _ Key presidential foreign policy documents should be reproduced for the incoming president `` We know of no large institution other than the White House in which, when a change of leadership occurs, many of the files relevant to continuing policy decisions are packed up and taken away by the departing top official,'' the report said. _ The <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> should be restored as the `` institutional memory'' of the president's office and the number of political appointees at the top of <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> should be reduced _ Pre-inaugural meetings between representatives of the incoming administration and foreign diplomats and leaders should be sharply limited _ Each presidential candidate should begin building a pool of potential foreign policy appointees immediately after the political party conventions, and use small task forces rather than large transition teams The report said that during a presidential campaign, candidates should be careful `` in the number and scope of promises they make in the foreign policy field. Some political promises which bring success in the election may produce failure in office.'' Once in office, a new president should be careful not to `` politicize the career services,'' the report said. New administrations are often `` distrustful of bureaucrats'' and only slowly do they learn how heavily they can rely on the professionalism of foreign service officers and members of the other career services,'' the report said.

 A pack of runners darted through the woods, bushwhacked up and down thicket-choked slopes, dashed along railroad tracks and abandoned roads, forded knee-deep streams and slogged through thigh-high mud. They closed out the day with beer, a barbecue and good fellowship. Born in the rubber plantations and jungles of east <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> in an era when the sun never set on the British empire, the sport known as hashing has made its way halfway around the world to <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, where one devotee is writing a book about it. Hashing, a non-competitive form of cross-country running that traces its roots to the game of hare and hounds, is enjoyed by roughly 50,000 participants in more than 700 clubs in 124 countries from <LOCATION> Andorra </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>. `` It's a way to get a little exercise and a little sociability,'' said freelance writer <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> of <PERSON> Hallowell </PERSON>, founder of the <ORGANIZATION> Hallowell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hash </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harriers </ORGANIZATION>, one of about 80 clubs in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> leads with 16. For her research on her forthcoming book, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> was recently in <LOCATION> Bali </LOCATION>, site of the 1988 Interhash, known as the biennial Olympics of hashing, and in <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> for the the 50th anniversary celebration of the founding of the original Hash House Harriers, known affectionately as `` the mother hash.'' The group was founded at a Kuala Lumpur club by British soldiers and expatriate businessmen who ran through the jungle to work up a thirst. It selected the name from the institutional quality of the club's food. At a midsummer hash that began at her lakefront cottage here, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> briefed newcomers on the rules. Runners designated as hares set the course in advance, marking it with flour; they are the only ones who know where it will lead. At various points, hares draw circles indicating checkpoints from which several possible routes fan out in different directions. All but one are false trails that end with a marker telling the runner to return to the checkpoint and try again. The runner who finally discovers the right trail shouts `` I'm on! or `` On-on!'' The hares who follow the pack to keep track of stragglers sound a horn, and all run toward the next checkpoint to restart the process. The search for the correct trail provides time for slower runners to catch up with those up front. `` It takes away a lot of the ego trip involved with track and other competitive racing,'' said <PERSON> Noel </PERSON> <PERSON> Mount </PERSON>, an Irish-born former rugby player who was one of the two dozen <PERSON> Hallowell </PERSON> hashers to run the nearly six-mile course. `` You get ahead, but then you take the wrong trail and that brings you back with everyone else.'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s husband, <PERSON> Wick </PERSON>, along with summer neighbors <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Greeves </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Engelman </PERSON>, reconnoitered the area the previous evening and spent three hours that morning laying out the route and marking it with 10 pounds of flour. In the tropics, hares use paper rather than flour to leave their marks. <PERSON> Greeves </PERSON>, a resident of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, introduced the <ORGANIZATION> Johnsons </ORGANIZATION> to hashing two years ago. While on a visit to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wick </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> was invited by <PERSON> Greeves </PERSON> to participate in an all-male hash. He returned exhausted but enthusiastic, telling his wife, a recreational runner, that this was a sport she would love. Upon her return home that summer, <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> rounded up a group of friends and neighbors from <PERSON> Hallowell </PERSON>, just outside <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION>, and organized the area's first hash. `` The trick is getting the right people at the beginning. It has to be people who do n't take themselves too seriously,'' she said. `` Most are runners, but it is definitely not a requirement. You just have to be fit enough to run approximately six miles _ with stops.''

 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> says his visit to <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> this week is not intended to force leaders there into a confrontation with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> over democratic reforms. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s 10-day journey to nine countries begins today in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, where he will meet with the foreign ministers of four Central American countries in an attempt to come up with a common strategy on the leftist Sandinista government. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> on Sunday said a statement which he said was drafted mostly by the foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> is still open to discussion. `` We're not trying to ram anything down anyone's throat,'' he said on the CBS-TV program, `` Face the Nation.'' `` Having drafted it, they are not so sure they want to issue it.'' <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, meanwhile, harshly criticized <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> for insisting that the joint communique on <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to be issued following today's meeting be softened, calling their action `` incomprehensible and strange.'' The Hondurans, in a statement issued to reporters Sunday night, said the Guatemalans and Costa Ricans had made a number of changes in the document that was first agreed to a month ago, including many provisions aimed at <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. A senior <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration official who briefed reporters on Friday said it was unclear whether the <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> meeting will result in a joint statement of principles designed to prod <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> into complying with its stated commitment to move toward democratic reforms. The official, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, said a consensus on a common policy toward <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> has been difficult to reach. The special <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoy to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Busby </PERSON>, has been consulting on that issue with officials from the four Central American nations. In <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> urged the four Central American countries to reject any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attempt to condemn or isolate <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> told reporters Sunday he hoped `` the Central American governments will respond with dignity and firmness and reject the proposal of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is `` trying to escalate the war ... with consequences for all the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> countries, not just for <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' A Guatemalan legislator, meanwhile, accused the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> of trying to pressure the countries into signing a virtual `` declaration of war'' against <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The legislator, <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulet </PERSON> <PERSON> Lesiur </PERSON>, representing a political party known as the Union of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said President <PERSON> Vinicio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerezo </PERSON> rejected a demand by <PERSON> Busby </PERSON> to abandon <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>'s policy of `` active neutrality'' by agreeing to the document <PERSON> Mulet </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> had agreed to sign it, while <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> turned it down. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> issued a statement Sunday categorically denying <PERSON> Mulet </PERSON>'s statements, made in an interview with a <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> newspaper. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has not ` pressured' <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> or any other country. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has not asked <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> to abandon ` active neutrality,''' the embassy said. A fragile cease-fire remains in place in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, but there has been no progress on a final settlement between the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> and the Contra rebels. The impasse has produced calls by conservative members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for a renewal of military aid to the rebels, In public statements this past week, rebel leaders have maintained the truce has helped the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> by enabling them to strengthen their overall military position while the Contras have been denied lethal aid from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The administration has contended the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> also have stepped up internal repression since the truce went into effect four months ago. In a commentary this past week in The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Times, Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said the situation in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> deteriorated after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> rejected a Contra military aid request in February. Much of <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s trip will be devoted to highlighting the democratic trend in the hemisphere. All of the nations on his itinerary have elected governments and all, with the exception of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, became democratic over the past nine years. After <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> will travel to <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> before a return trip, lasting 24 hours, to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> on Aug. 8 for talks in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. The trip ends on Aug. 10 when <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> will attend the inaugural ceremony of Ecuadoran President-elect <PERSON> Rodrigo </PERSON> <PERSON> Borja </PERSON>. While in <LOCATION> Quito </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> also will confer with President <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucinchi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Gulf Still Has `Couple of Hundred' Mines, Officers Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD PYLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ABOARD USS CONQUEST IN THE PERSIAN GULF (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 This old <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> mine sweeper and five others like it may remain in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> until an estimated `` couple of hundred'' mines still lurking in the waters are found and destroyed, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officers say. While a cease-fire in the Iraq-Iran war would probably keep new mines from being laid, those already deployed could pose a danger to shipping for years to come unless cleaned up. The task falls to ships like the creaky, 800-ton Conquest, whose crew works these days in 130-degree deck temperatures, using a submersible robot to locate mines and trailing gear to cut the cables that moor them to the seabed. When a submerged mine shows up on the sonar screen, divers are guided to the spot and attach explosives, which are detonated by time fuse or remote control. Capt. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, `` commodore'' of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mine-sweeping force, would not predict how long the tedious and dangerous job of clearing the gulf of mines might require. `` We're not going to do it in a week or two weeks,'' he said in an interview. `` It's going to take a lot longer than that.'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said this could mean some or all of the six <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mine sweepers in the gulf might be excluded from a force cutback promised by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials when and if <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> formally agree to a truce in their 8-year-old war. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which is blamed for laying most of the mines in the gulf, announced July 18 that it would join <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in accepting a year-old <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire resolution. The wooden-hulled <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mine sweepers, all built in the early 1950s but updated for gulf duty with modern sonar, navigation and mine-hunting gear, comprise about a third of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> naval force now in the gulf. Their `` mothership'' is the amphibious landing ship <LOCATION> Dubuque </LOCATION>, which also carries about 400 Marines and eight helicopters. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military sources in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> say the six aging mine sweepers might possibly be given to a gulf Arab state rather than returned to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The navy has 15 other mine sweepers of similar vintage, and is building 31 new, state-of-the-art ships for hunting mines. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said he had `` no firsthand knowledge'' of such a plan, but noted that scores of former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships are now sailing with other navies. He conceded it could take years before the gulf is free of mines, if ever. Mines laid in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> during World War II were still being recovered as recently as 1980, he said. The mine threat had a major role in prompting the naval buildup by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and five European navies in the gulf a year ago. In addition to the six <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> craft, which arrived in November, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> sent anti-mine forces. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> also has ships capable of mine-sweeping in the waterway. European forces were later cut back, and two remaining Belgian and Dutch mine-hunters combined with three British ships under <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> command. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> records indicate at least 10 vessels have hit mines in the gulf since the Soviet tanker Marshal <PERSON> Chuikov </PERSON> was damaged off <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> on May 16, 1987. Among later victims were the U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti supertanker <LOCATION> Bridgeton </LOCATION>, the American frigate <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, an offshore supply vessel sunk with six killed and an ocean survey ship with four lost. After the <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> narrowly escaped destruction in the central gulf on April 14, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> searchers found three more mines in those waters. Officers said all were clean of marine growth, indicating they were newly laid, and one bore the letters `` USA'' in white paint. The mines, of a 1908 Russian type, were identical with those found aboard the captured Iranian minelayer <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> Ajr in September, they said. Overall, some 80 mines have been found in the past year, according to available records. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said `` everybody has found some.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> found 52, the latest in May. The British and French each have found more than a dozen. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said the estimated `` couple of hundred'' mines still in the gulf are concentrated in certain areas, including waters just south of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and an area of the northern gulf near Iranian-held <LOCATION> Farsi </LOCATION> island. The mines off <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, believed laid by both sides, are a special threat because they break lose in rough weather and drift to the Arab side of the gulf. Several vessels have struck these renegade `` floaters'' off <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>.

 Seventeen advocates for the homeless are arrested after seizing a vacant <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> hotel. Activists take over two abandoned public housing units in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. During a day of nationwide protests, 18 people are arrested in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> as they try to commandeer a boarded-up building. New, more aggressive tactics to get housing for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s homeless have led to repeated assaults on vacant buildings for takeover and restoration `` Abandoned buildings are a very powerful symbol,'' said activist <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON>. `` There's no reason for them to lie fallow while millions of people are homeless, except for lack of funding.'' <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> and his Washington-based Community for Creative Non-Violence have organized sit-ins and monthlong hunger strikes in their push for shelters and housing for the homeless. `` Creating shelters is no alternative to affordable housing,'' <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> said. `` I went to 48 cities in two weeks last month meeting with people and encouraging them to plan occupations of buildings.'' Said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, a former Wall Street lawyer and founder of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> for the Homeless, `` Tactics that do n't make explicit that the solution to homelessness is housing do n't make sense.'' <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said most important is legislation to provide affordable housing, but building occupations highlight the importance of legislation. `` That kind of work is only strengthened by voices coming from the streets,'' he said. More than 100 activists were arrested during protests in about 50 cities July 14, a day of coordinated building occupations to promote affordable housing legislation introduced in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, Homeless Action Day protests turned to violence when about 80 activists used crow bars to tear boards from doors and windows of an abandoned building. Eighteen protesters were charged with breaking and entering and assaulting a police officer. One woman was injured when she was struck by a mounted officer's horse as it galloped through the crowd. `` I consider myself one of the lucky 18 to be able to make a statement about the plight of the homeless,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Cambridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shelter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION>, who was arrested in the fracas. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said advocates are willing to risk arrest and injury because sit-ins and marches have not been effective. In <LOCATION> Northampton </LOCATION>, activists commandeered a vacant house on the grounds of a state mental hospital July 14. Hospital officials watched as the activists began converting the building into a shelter, but had them arrested three days later for trespassing. `` We called it a work-in,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Markham </PERSON>, a spokesman for the group. <PERSON> Markham </PERSON> said their aim was to place `` constructive, non-violent'' pressure on state officials to turn vacant public buildings into housing. While more than 100 people were arrested nationwide during the July 14 action, <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hager </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Homeless </ORGANIZATION> said occupations in some cities led to new housing. The mayors of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> allowed protesters to keep the abandoned buildings they had begun renovating, he said. Activity has not been limited to July 14. The <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> incidents occurred in early January, as did the arrest of 17 activists in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, who occupied three vacant Victorian homes the city hopes to restore. On March 16, one woman was arrested and several protesters fought with police as 35 squatters were evicted from a <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, house owned by the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>. Other actions included a three-month sit-in by homeless people on the steps of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION>. The group ended its protest July 21 when city officials promised an office and a crisis hotline for the homeless. In November 1987, <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> police evicted 15 homeless people who set up a tent city on university property for about a month hoping for an offer of housing. Homeless Action Day was planned to call attention to a bill introduced by Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass., two days earlier <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s bill would provide $ 15 billion a year for the next five years to build 7.5 million affordable housing units <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> denounced the protests, saying they would not help his legislation. `` It was all very stupid, very unfair,'' he said. `` The bill's been out for only two days.'' `` There's so much to be done,'' <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said, `` that almost every tactic has to be employed.''

 Authorities in <LOCATION> Bejing </LOCATION> are refusing to allow former <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> ruler <PERSON> Pol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON> to leave <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, where the leader of the murderous <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> regime is hospitalized for unspecified treatment, a magazine reported.

While <PERSON> Pol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> ruled <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> from 1975-78, hundreds of thousands of people died in vast slave-labor camps and execution chambers as the government attempted to turn the country into a primitive agrarian society.

 After being plagued for years by the annoying buzz of the lusty humming toadfish, hundreds of houseboat residents here decided to turn the other gill, er, cheek. The humming toadfish season usually marks a time when sleepy houseboat dwellers put pillows over their heads to escape the irritating nighttime sound of thousands of sex-starved male fish. But this year, houseboaters threw the Sausalito Humming Toadfish Festival instead. `` They're just out looking for a mate, just like everybody else in <LOCATION> Sausalito </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCosker </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Steinhart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aquarium </ORGANIZATION> ichthyologist and oceanographer who identified the humming toadfish as the cause of the mysterious buzz in 1985. In its courtship ritual, the fish sidles up to a concrete structure _ a cave or houseboat will do _ and blows air through its bladder. The noise apparently drives female toadfish crazy with desire. The hum usually begins in June and stops when the mating season ends in August. About 5,000 people turned out for Sunday's fish festival in which <PERSON> McCosker </PERSON> was crowned king of the festivities. `` It was overwhelming,'' <PERSON> McCosker </PERSON> said. `` Who would have thought as an ichthyologist I would have risen to such heights, or, in <LOCATION> Sausalito </LOCATION>, such depths.''

 <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s palate apparently is honed to where the buffalo roam, says <PERSON> Duane </PERSON> <PERSON> Helland </PERSON>, who specializes in bison cuisine. <PERSON> Helland </PERSON>, who owns and operates <ORGANIZATION> Helland </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Locker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> with his wife, <PERSON> Sue </PERSON>, decided to expand his menu to include the great American bison in reaction to `` a changing society,'' he said. `` People want to eat meat that's low in calories, fat and cholesterol and high in protein,'' said <PERSON> Helland </PERSON>, who has filled orders for almost 5,000 pounds of buffalo meat. The average serving of beef contains 24 percent protein and 28 percent fat. Buffalo has 35 percent protein and 3 percent fat, according to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>. There is about half the amount of cholesterol in a buffalo roast than in a similar cut of beef, said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvall </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Buffalo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pierre </LOCATION>, S.D. `` If it's not overcooked, it's a little sweeter than beef.

There's a catch, though. `` It's twice the price of beef,'' <PERSON> Helland </PERSON> said. In 1850, about 20 million buffalo thundered on the western plains.

<TEXT>
 As the nation's top Mafia investigator, <PERSON> Giovanni </PERSON> <PERSON> Falcone </PERSON> symbolized a new generation of brave, activist judges dedicated to ending the reign of organized crime in <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION>. Now, he and eight fellow investigating magistrates have resigned, spurring questions about the depth of the government's commitment to fighting the Mafia All nine had played a prominent role in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s largest Mafia trial. In stepping down with the others on Saturday, <PERSON> Falcone </PERSON> said he wanted to be able to freely testify before a judicial panel looking into the government's anti-Mafia effort. He also suggested there was something profoundly wrong with the war on organized crime. Following reports that members of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s dominant political party had in an unrelated case arranged payment of a ransom to underworld figures, the resignations shocked Italians and prompted criticism of the government. `` The judges and all the others that have risked their lives fighting the Mafia have felt increasingly abandoned by the state,'' the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Corriere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> della </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sera </ORGANIZATION> said in a front-page editorial on Sunday. <PERSON> Falcone </PERSON>, 48, and the other eight resigning investigators had together comprised a special `` anti-Mafia pool,'' which was formed after the 1983 assassination of the chief investigating magistrate in <LOCATION> Palermo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION>'s capital. The team, led by <PERSON> Falcone </PERSON>, pushed Italian law to its limit, examining bank records of alleged Mafiosi and ordering sweeping arrests. It was the dapper, mustachioed <PERSON> Falcone </PERSON> who persuaded mob figure <PERSON> Tommaso </PERSON> <PERSON> Buscetta </PERSON> to detail the structure of the Mafia and how it shipped heroin from <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, a breakthrough that led to the nation's huge organized crime trial. The so-called maxi-trial ended in December with convictions of 338 Mafiosi, including 19 reputed members of the <ORGANIZATION> Cosa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nostra </ORGANIZATION>'s leadership commission Since the trial, however, the anti-Mafia pool has been stymied by its new director, chaos in the police force and government indifference, according to prominent Sicilian prosecutor <PERSON> Paolo </PERSON> <PERSON> Borsellino </PERSON>. <PERSON> Borsellino </PERSON>'s declarations to journalists two weeks ago prompted President <PERSON> Francesco </PERSON> <PERSON> Cossiga </PERSON> to order investigations by the ministries of <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magistrates </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees judges. As the judges' body began hearings in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> on Saturday, <PERSON> Falcone </PERSON> and his colleagues submitted their resignations and asked for transfers. `` That which I had feared could happen unfortunately happened,'' <PERSON> Falcone </PERSON> wrote. `` The investigations into the Mafia have been obstructed and -LRB- the anti-Mafia pool -RRB- ... is now stalled.'' Another investigator who resigned, <PERSON> Giuseppe </PERSON> <PERSON> Di </PERSON> <PERSON> Lello </PERSON>, charged: `` The inattention of the government is palpable in the disorganization of the investigating offices.'' <PERSON> Falcone </PERSON> did not elaborate on how or why the investigations may have slowed. But he said his views on prosecuting the Mafia `` diverge radically'' from those of the chief investigating magistrate, <PERSON> Antonino </PERSON> <PERSON> Meli </PERSON>. <PERSON> Meli </PERSON> was appointed in February over the objections of <PERSON> Falcone </PERSON> and others, who said he had no experience in Mafia probes. <PERSON> Borsellino </PERSON>, a former member of the anti-Mafia pool, told reporters that <PERSON> Meli </PERSON> had removed <PERSON> Falcone </PERSON> as chief of major anti-Mafia cases. <PERSON> Meli </PERSON> also divided the anti-Mafia work load among all investigators, regardless of whether they were specialists, <PERSON> Borsellino </PERSON> said, reverting to the system followed before the pool was created. `` There have been serious attempts by the office of investigations and the prosecutor of the republic of <LOCATION> Palermo </LOCATION> to definitively dismantle the anti-Mafia pool,'' he said. <PERSON> Meli </PERSON> responded: `` The pool has not been destroyed, as <PERSON> Borsellino </PERSON> says, and if anything it has been enlarged with the addition of other judges.'' Saturday's resignations prompted expressions of concern from Italian politicians about the state of the war on the Mafia. `` There is a problem of management and administration of men; of the types of judges; and it is more than a guess to think that the difficulties have been exacerbated by the inopportune handling of this government,'' said <PERSON> Virginio </PERSON> <PERSON> Rognoni </PERSON> of the dominant <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> party who heads the justice commission in the Chamber of Deputies. Last Thursday, an investigating judge released a report saying some <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> helped gain the release of a kidnapped colleague in 1981 by arranging ransoms for the <ORGANIZATION> Neopolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mafia </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION> leftist terrorists. Among those who may have been involved was <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Gava </PERSON>, the current interior minister, the report said. <PERSON> Gava </PERSON> denied the charge. `` Today, we expected the resignation of Interior Minister <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Gava </PERSON>,'' the Communist newspaper <ORGANIZATION> L'Unita </ORGANIZATION> said in a front-page editorial Sunday headlined `` Honest Men and an Arrogant Government.'' `` <PERSON> Gava </PERSON> stays and <PERSON> Falcone </PERSON> leaves; it is not a good day for <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>.''

 Jewish emigration from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> reached a new eight-year-high in July with a total of 1,639 allowed to leave the country, the agency involved in their resettlement said today. The total represented the seventh straight monthly rise in the number of arrivals at the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, transit center, the Geneva-based <ORGANIZATION> Intergovermental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Migration </ORGANIZATION> said.

Last month's figure compared with 1,767 who left the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in June 1980, and brought to 7,656 the number of Jews emigrating in the first seven months of the year, the committee said. The largest official exodus _ 51,330 _ was recorded in 1979 before the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> intervention in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> chilled East-West relations. Nearly 270,000 Soviet Jews have emigrated since the resettlement program began in 1971.

 In an attempt to catch more viewers' eyes, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> has put color, movement and depth in its own eye after nearly four decades. The new eye logo, which made its debut during Sunday's `` 60 Minutes'' broadcast, is blue and three-dimensional.

It still looks like the original, full-screen, black and white eye, which had been the network's symbol since the early 1950s. `` The eye is sacrosanct,'' <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> vice president of advertising and promotion for the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, said during the planning stages. `` We do n't tamper with the shape of the eye.

<HEAD>More Murder And Assault Cases; 1,200 Officers Fired After
Corruption Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Violent crime in the Soviet capital is down overall but murders, assaults and juvenile crime are on the rise and authorities probing police corruption have fired about 1,200 people, an official said. `` We do n't hide that fact that in our ranks, there are bribe-takers, money-grubbers, common criminals in police uniform,'' said Lt. Gen. P.S. <PERSON> Bogdanov </PERSON>, chief of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, which controls police affairs. `` But we will not stop until our ranks have been cleansed,'' <PERSON> Bogdanov </PERSON> told a recent news conference in remarks published Sunday by <ORGANIZATION> Komsomolskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION>, the national youth daily. He said that as a result of investigations in the first half of 1988, about 1,200 Internal Affairs employees in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> were fired. The official said that in the first six months of 1988, there was a rise in murder, assault with intent to kill and assault resulting in serious injury, compared to the same period last year. The newspaper report gave no specific figures or reasons for the change. <PERSON> Bogdanov </PERSON> said, however, that the number of all crimes registered in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> declined by 9.6 percent compared to 1987. Violent crime _ excluding murder and assault _ dropped by 4.2 percent, he said. He did not give the actual number of crimes registered. In the first six months of 1988, Muscovites aged 18 and younger committed 25.6 percent of the crimes in the city, while juvenile crime accounted for 22.6 percent of the city's unlawful acts during the same period in 1987, the police general said. The juvenile crimes included robbery, rape, joyriding in someone else's car and apartment break-ins, he said. <PERSON> Bogdanov </PERSON> said his ministry will continue to clean out corruption in police ranks, a process begun more than a year ago under the reforms of Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>.

Hussein has decided to abandon responsibility for government
services in West Bank. No pickup.

<TEXT>
 In relinquishing any claim to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> has also decided to abandon responsibility for all government services in the Israeli-occupied territory, a senior government official said today. `` It is a complete divorce of this kingdom from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>,'' the official said, commenting on <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s address Sunday. In a televised speech also seen in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the occupied lands, the king challenged the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to try to make a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state of the territory his family ruled until it was seized by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> 21 years ago. It was the latest in a flurry of moves by <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> that appeared to rule out the possibility of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> representing Palestinians in any peace talks. The move also acknowledged that the 8-month-old uprising in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s occupied lands has largely looked for leadership to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, reducing Jordanian influence in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> said that since there `` is a general conviction that the struggle to liberate the occupied Palestinian land could be enhanced by dismantling the legal and administrative links between the two banks, we have to fulfill our duty and do what is required of us.'' The government official, who spoke on conditon of anonymity, said, `` That means we will not be responsible for any services in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> ... That land is <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> and this is a separate country.'' He explained that <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> `` is no longer responsible for municipalities, health, social, educational, religious or cultural sectors in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>.'' But he told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> `` we will continue to pay pensions to civil servants and teachers who have been appointed by the <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> government and served our kingdom during the past 35 years.'' The late King <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s grandfather, united both sides of the <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and merged all institutions and services with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> when he annexed the area after the 1948 Arab-Israel war. <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> administered the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> until <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized it in the 1967 Middle East War and set up a military government that shared services with local authorities. <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> has since been paying teachers, lawyers and other employees who work in Arab institutions in the territory. On Saturday, <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> dissolved the lower house of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, half of whose members represented the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. On Thursday, he canceled a $ 1.3 billion development project for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s occupied lands. `` <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> is not Palestine,'' the king said Sunday in his 17-minute address. `` The independent Palestinian state will be established on occupied Palestinian land after its liberation, God willing.'' It was the first time <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, who has previously backed the idea of an independent Palestinian state, told Palestinians in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> to take affairs into their own hands. The move could make the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s only potential negotiating partner in talks to resolve the issue, dashing hopes for Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s peace initiative. Under the <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> plan, <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> would have been partially responsible for representing the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> in proposed <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace talks. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> refuses to talk to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, calling it a terrorist organization. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, speaking Sunday on <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Face the Nation,'' denied <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s moves would pressure the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to find a way to talk to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. `` We will stay right where we are. We're ready to talk to them -LRB- PLO -RRB- when they take certain steps, which are very clear, and as far as I can see, not too onerous,'' he said. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> said Sunday that <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>'s links to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> `` hamper the Palestinian struggle to gain international support for the Palestinian cause, as the national cause of a people struggling against foreign occupation.'' The uprising in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, which has claimed the lives of 235 Arabs and four Israelis, has given greater international prominence to the Palestinian cause and increased calls for an independent state. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> said Sunday that his moves were `` in response to the wish of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> ... and the prevailing Arab conviction that such measures would contribute to the struggle of the Palestinian people.'' Today, the senior <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> official said it is `` up to the new <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> government to decide on measures to handle the break of administrative and legal ties with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>.'' He was referring to an expected cabinet reshuffle, the magnitude of which was not made clear. The official also said he interpreted the king's speech to indicate <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> would `` not issue new Jordanian passports to residents of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>.'' Two thirds of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s 3.5 million people are of Palestinian origin and carry the Jordanian passport. All <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> residents and some from the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> hold the Jordanian passport.

 The second leak of a noxious chemical in 3 -LCB- months from a <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> plant sent more than 120 people to hospitals, and at least nine were admitted though none had serious injuries, officials said. Less than three gallons of phosphorous trichloride, a component of the herbicide <PERSON> Lasso </PERSON>, escaped into the air when a `` rupture disk,'' designed to break when pressure built up in the tank, gave way Sunday morning, said <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartolanzo </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. The leak was plugged within five minutes, and no evacuation was ordered, she said. On April 17, 22 square blocks of neighboring <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> were evacuated when about 250 gallons of the substance spilled during loading onto a railroad tank car, officials have said. `` It's just a normal thing,'' <PERSON> Willa </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Tooks </PERSON>, 40, who lives about four blocks from the plant, said after Sunday's leak. `` We're always getting fumes. Most people who went to hospitals were released after treatment for burning eyes, nausea, headaches, shortness of breath and dizziness, but at least nine people were admitted, hospital officials said. `` My chest was hurting and my eyes was watering and my throat was ... dry and every time I breathed, it felt like my wind was cutting out,'' said <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleggett </PERSON>, 22, of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. He said he was at his mother's home, about a mile from the plant, when fumes entered the home. <PERSON> Cleggett </PERSON> was in good condition at <LOCATION> Centreville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, a nurse there. Company officials began an investigation immediately after the leak, Ms. <PERSON> Bartolanzo </PERSON> said. She also said that, as in April, the company will pay medical expenses due to the spill.

<HEAD>Ranks Restored In Chinese Army</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Chinese military celebrated its 61st anniversary today by restoring a ranking system in a move seen as critical to its efforts to develop a modern fighting force. In related developments Saturday, the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> bestowed medals on thousands of veterans and announced more than 100,000 soldiers would be transferred to a new civilian staff. Western military analysts in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and the official <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> media said the moves were connected to reforms aimed at modernizing <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s armed forces and ridding it of the leftist influences. The analysts, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also said the ranking system was designed to raise the morale of the army, which since 1978 has seen many of its factories converted to civilian use and its troop strength and share of the state budget slashed. <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON> abolished military ranks 23 years ago as part of his attempt to create a classless society. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> then ascribed to a fighting philosophy called `` people's war,'' which envisaged an all-out war fought by a huge peasant army. Since <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> began its economic reforms in 1978, it has moved to create a professional army with top-notch military equipment. Western analysts today said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s poor showing in its brief war with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in 1979 also did much to convince military leaders of the necessity of a strict ranking system. In addition, the trouble with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> on the border and over islands in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> has led the Chinese to believe future conflicts will not be an all-out war but `` geographically contained battles that necessitate a rapid deployment force of highly trained soldiers,'' said one diplomat. `` These kinds of units need a strict command structure, with a clear delineation as to who is giving and who is receiving the orders,'' he said. `` Before today they did n't have that.'' Friday's issue of the People's Daily -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Renmin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ribao </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- said the move to transfer 100,000 soldiers to civilian status was part of a program to cut the number of `` officials'' in the army. `` The ratio of officials to soldiers is lopsided,'' it said. `` They are too many officers and many of them are too old.'' Apart from strategic issues, analysts said the ranking system and the awarding of medals were undertaken to raise morale in the People's <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. Since 1978, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> had reduced the army from 4 million to 3 million men, cut the army's share of the state budget from 17.5 percent to less than 10 percent, and turned military industry factories to consumer production. In addition, the army has all but been shut out of politics. Finally, a program to acquire advanced weapons systems has been slowed because of budget constraints. `` If the army is not getting weapons, the least the government can give them is ranks,'' said one analyst. Analysts said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> had to award medals and ranks to its veterans, some of whom maintain a strong influence over the military, because it would have been an insult to award ranks only to those currently in service. `` Part of the reason all this took so long is that the veterans were bickering about who was to get which medal or which rank,'' one analyst said, citing Chinese sources. `` They are evidently very concerned with status.'' On Saturday, four classes of medals were awarded to about 80,000 veterans. According to the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, military officers in the army will be divided into three grades with 11 ranks: four ranks of generals, four ranks of field officer _ senior colonel, colonel, lieutenant colonel and major, and three ranks of company officer: captain, lieutenant and second lieutenant. Previously, officers were given commands of groups such as platoons and divisions or were assigned to regional command posts, but there was no clear ranking hierarchy.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> begins an expanded effort this week to win over the black voters he largely ignored in the primaries and who have yet to respond in any big way to an endorsement by <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. The Democratic presidential nominee travels to <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> tonight to address an Urban League convention and, according to an aide, his campaign this week will begin distributing literature highlighting his gubernatorial record on issues such as affirmative action and judicial appointments. `` <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is not a known quantity to black Americans but this should help change that,'' said <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Brazile </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign's deputy national field director. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also plans to invest in black media advertising and will schedule campaign events in inner city neighborhoods and other predominantly black areas, <PERSON> Brazile </PERSON> said. He rarely ventured into black communities during the primaries and still draws relatively few blacks to campaign events. <PERSON> Brazile </PERSON> and other top <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> advisers conceded in interviews during last week's seven-state campaign trip that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s endorsement of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> has yet to translate into visible support for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> among blacks One assessment of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' problem came from <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Riddle </PERSON>, field director for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s winning effort in the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> caucuses. `` All you got in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> was that <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> got a little prime time, a credit card and an airplane,'' he said. `` Black America is still not sure what's in it for them and until that gap is bridged I do n't think you'll see them being too enthusiastic about <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his staff are trying to erase such sentiments. In <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, and here in <LOCATION> Flint </LOCATION> last week, he met with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> backers, all of whom, according to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides, pledged their support. Shortly after <PERSON> Riddle </PERSON> spoke to reporters during a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> rally in <LOCATION> Flint </LOCATION>, he was approached by <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiley </PERSON>, a senior <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> adviser who is among the campaign's ranking black officials. `` Sure we've got a problem right now,'' <PERSON> Wiley </PERSON> said later. `` But we're meeting with the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> leaders this trip to start the process of taking care of it. `` We'll get to his people, at the grass-roots level, but you ca n't go to the people without first coming together with the leadership.'' Leaders who met with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> last week gave positive reviews. Others already have begun helping the nominee. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was greeted at the <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> airport by <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Davis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Powers </ORGANIZATION>, a longtime state senator who was a <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> backer. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporter in the primary who was at the airport to help with the greeting, said the area's black community `` is ready to go for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> people have been spreading the word, and I think blacks will go with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.'' Complicating <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' outreach efforts, aides concede, is <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s still unclear role in the fall campaign and uneasiness among senior <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> advisers over the outspoken <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> moved quickly to distance himself from <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s effort to get involved in talks to free American hostages believed to be held captive by pro-Iranian groups in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> but was careful not to criticize <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> himself. `` He's an American citizen,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` We agree on a lot of things and we do n't agree on some things.'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign chairman and its chief liaison with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, said he expected <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to campaign with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> soon but said no schedule has been made.

 Sea World officials put a 1,400-pound baby sperm whale that beached itself near <LOCATION> Sanibel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> into a special pool as they worked to keep it alive long enough to return it to freedom. The week-old male, which arrived Sunday at Sea World, was in critical condition, said <PERSON> Jerie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the marine attraction. `` For an animal like this, -LRB- research scientists -RRB- will be on 24-hour watch.'' The 12-foot-long calf was placed in a rehabilitation pool in an area not open to the public. Beachings of sperm whales are rare, and there have only been about a half-dozen in the last 25 years, said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorzelany </PERSON>, coordinator of the <ORGANIZATION> Mote </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> Stranding Program. Very few survive in captivity. The sperm whale, which grows to about 50 feet, is an endangered species. It feeds primarily on squid and fish and normally lives in water with depths in excess of 600 feet. The whale was found by two fishermen Saturday, beached on a shoal just south of <LOCATION> Sanibel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and mired in `` ankle deep'' mud. <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> officials contacted <ORGANIZATION> Mote </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> experts. `` We checked him and found his heart rate to be erratic and rapid, about 60 beats per minute,'' <PERSON> Gorzelany </PERSON> said. `` It took 14 people to lift him and carry him about 100 yards to the truck,'' <PERSON> Gorzelany </PERSON> said. `` We could only move him about 10 yards at a time.'' Officials do n't know why whales beach themselves.

 Vandals damaged the concrete tomb of President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s husband but did not disturb the body, a military official said today. Maj. <PERSON> Hernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Patawaran </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, said the damage apparently was done late Friday at the <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> Memorial Park cemetery and was discovered Saturday. <PERSON> Patawaran </PERSON> said the vandals pried loose a concrete slab from the top of the tomb of Sen. <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who was murdered Aug. 21, 1983. <PERSON> Patawaran </PERSON> said park authorities received a telephone call Saturday saying a bomb had been planted in the tomb. Bomb experts inspected the site, but found nothing, he said. Soldiers guarded the tomb today, and workers said they reinforced it with steel sheets. A witness, who visited the nearby grave of a relative Saturday, said presidential guards surrounded <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s grave. <PERSON> Patawaran </PERSON> said officials did not know who vandalized the grave or why. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> was shot dead at <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> International Airport moments after he returned from three years of self-imposed exile in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The slaying fueled opposition to then-President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> that culminated in a military-civilian uprising, which toppled his administration in February 1986 and brought Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to power. Opposition leaders at the time blamed the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> administration for the killing. Forty people, most of them soldiers, are on trial in the assassination.

 Former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> was listed in serious condition this morning, recovering from a near drowning in her backyard pool, and a doctor says she could be out of the hospital within a week. `` Right now, I think things look very good that she'll get totally back to normal,'' said Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Little </PERSON>, a neurologist. `` She's very close to normal right now. I think she will continue to improve. As best as I can tell right now, she probably will regain full mental functions.'' Ms. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>'s condition was upgraded Sunday afternoon from critical to serious but stable, and she continued to improve Sunday night. `` She started her liquid diet tonight. She is breathing on her own. She is receiving supplemental oxygen, though,'' hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Kari </PERSON> <PERSON> Larsen </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, 52, gave the thumbs-up sign Sunday to her intensive care unit nurse and was able to talk. `` She's in good spirits now because she knows she's going to get well,'' said Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Deaton </PERSON>, a pulmonary specialist. `` She's emotional about that and a little bit teary-eyed some of the time, knowing what she's been through and how close she came to a real catastrophic event. But she still also has her jovial personality. She was joking a little bit this morning,'' <PERSON> Deaton </PERSON> said Sunday. `` She is vastly improved.'' Ms. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, who gained national attention during the 1974 Watergate impeachment hearings, was flown by emergency helicopter to <LOCATION> Brackenridge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> on Saturday after being found floating face-down in her pool. Ms. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>'s live-in companion, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Earl </PERSON>, called paramedics, who restored her pulse and breathing. <PERSON> Deaton </PERSON> said she came `` within four to five minutes, 10 minutes at most'' of suffering severe brain damage and possibly death. `` She does not know what happened and was clearly concerned about it and had indicated that she did n't think she would go swimming alone again,'' <PERSON> Deaton </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> was breathing Saturday night only with the help of a ventilator, but Sunday the device was gone and she was responding to questions and talking, doctors said. Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate, telephoned a message for Ms. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> made a seconding speech for <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s nomination at the recent Democratic National Convention. Doctors said it is n't known what caused Ms. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> to lose consciousness in the pool, but the lack of oxygen caused cardiac arrest. <PERSON> Deaton </PERSON> said he expected Ms. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> to remain in intensive care for 48 hours and to be hospitalized for about a week. The doctors said Ms. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, who has been confined to a wheelchair for several years, suffers from multiple sclerosis. She swims as therapy. `` She has muscle weakness, and it would be difficult for her to rescue herself from the swimming pool if she had any warning of any event. ... I doubt, though, based on the suddenness of the event, that she had any warning,'' <PERSON> Deaton </PERSON> said. Doctors were uncertain how long she was in the pool before being discovered. Ms. <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> said she returned from a short errand to find Ms. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> unconscious in the pool. Ms. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> in 1966 became the first black state senator in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> history. In 1972, she was the first Southern black elected to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> since Reconstruction, serving until 1978, when she left politics after three terms in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to teach at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION>.

 Thousands of holiday travelers rushing to board a ferry caused a pier to collapse, leaving at least 31 people dead and injuring nearly 1,000, officials and news reports said today. Survivors said the upper level of a two-tiered pier in <LOCATION> Butterworth </LOCATION>, 180 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Kuala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lumpur </LOCATION>, fell without warning Sunday afternoon. The upper section full of waiting passengers crashed onto people in cars and motorcycles on the lower level waiting to board the ferry. Victims were pinned beneath steel and timber while firefighters and port workers tried to free them and search for others. Emergency officials said all of those killed were believed to be <LOCATION> Malaysian </LOCATION>. About 300 people were on the pier and 3,000 were lined up behind them when the rush to the ferry began, port commission Chairman <PERSON> Syed </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohhamad </PERSON> <PERSON> Aidid </PERSON> told the national news agency <ORGANIZATION> Bernama </ORGANIZATION>. He said the 40-foot section that collapsed normally held about 200 people. The travelers were waiting to make the three-mile trip to <LOCATION> Penang </LOCATION> island for the Kwan Yin -LRB- Goddess of Mercy -RRB- Chinese religious celebration, held once every 60 years. `` Everything happened so fast, I could only scream for help,'' <PERSON> Gee </PERSON> <PERSON> Swee </PERSON> <PERSON> Cain </PERSON>, 41, a supervisor of the passenger ferry at the pier, told <ORGANIZATION> Bernama </ORGANIZATION>. As soon as the crowd rushed forward, the pier's wooden upper level gave way, sending hundreds of people plummeting to the lower level, said Mrs. Gee, who suffered chest and face injuries and a broken leg. Her husband and 5-year-old child were uninjured. `` I screamed for help and heard someone from above telling me to be patient because at that time nothing could be done to help me,'' Mrs. Gee told <ORGANIZATION> Bernama </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Cheong </PERSON> <PERSON> Ah </PERSON> <PERSON> Chey </PERSON>, 21, who saw the pier collapse, was quoted by the news agency as saying, `` The crowd at the waiting area was moving toward the gate to get into the ferry, which had just berthed, when suddenly the platform below them gave way.'' Three cars entering the ferry were crushed and a port commission office was destroyed, officials said. The death toll from the collapse was considered likely to rise, as many of the injured were hospitalized in critical condition, <ORGANIZATION> Bernama </ORGANIZATION> quoted police and other officials as saying. Hospitals and clinics in the area initially reported 969 people injured, with 502 admitted and 467 treated and released, <ORGANIZATION> Bernama </ORGANIZATION> said. Officials today said 417 people remained hospitalized. Prime Minister <PERSON> Mahathir </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohamad </PERSON> visited the injured at a government hospital. He told reporters the government would give $ 800 immediately to the family of each victim and that he would consider further compensation. The port commission halted ferry service between <PERSON> Butterworth </PERSON> and Penang pending an inquiry. Traffic jammed <LOCATION> Penang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>, the only vehicle link to the island from the mainland after the closure of the ferry terminal. Despite the accident, <PERSON> Penang </PERSON> was crowded with thousands of people watching the festive parades in the streets. The pier was built in 1956 and repaired from time to time, <ORGANIZATION> Bernama </ORGANIZATION> reported. The platform that collapsed was last renovated in 1986, when its planks and bolts were replaced. The structure was built with pillars only at the sides of the structure and not in the center, where the section failed.

<TEXT>
 A 74-year-old man who got lost on his way to the dentist and ended up 600 miles away says part of the problem was he'd never been away from home. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Centreville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, on Sunday following a 17-hour journey that began at 5 a.m. Friday when he left for his appointment north of <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>. Police stopped him at 10:15 p.m. Friday as he was driving west in the eastbound lane near <LOCATION> Muncie </LOCATION>, in central <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. `` They knew I did n't have no business on that street and so they stopped me,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indianapolis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday from the home he shares with his mother-in-law. `` I was glad the law stopped me. I was so glad, I did n't know what to do. I had n't eaten, I had n't drank any water. Authorities gave <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> food and a place to stay until members of his church arrived Sunday to take him home. `` It has been one of the strangest things I've ever been involved with,'' said <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, police Officer <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>. `` I've been a policeman for 10 years and never had anything like this. It's a miracle he ever made it up here.'' <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> told police he was on his way to the dentist but could n't find the office. He said he turned around to head home. Instead, police believe, he wound up on Interstate 65, which runs from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to Mobile, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>. From <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, I-65 continues northwest toward <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Muncie </LOCATION> does not lie along the interstate. <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> said he stopped to buy gasoline in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, and asked for directions home. But no one knew where <LOCATION> Centreville </LOCATION> was. <LOCATION> Centreville </LOCATION> is in central <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, about 25 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> and about 600 miles from <LOCATION> Muncie </LOCATION>. `` So I just kept driving,'' he said. `` When the law stopped me, they straightened me out. I had n't ever been away from home. I did n't know I was that far away until they told me. They treated me mighty nice.'' <PERSON> Collier </PERSON>'s mother-in-law, <PERSON> Lula </PERSON> <PERSON> Irvin </PERSON>, 96, said she did n't know what happened to him until police called her. `` He just got on the wrong road and he had never been nowhere,'' she said. `` I was worried when he was gone.''

 An explosion and fire ripped through a two-story army barracks in north <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> early today, killing a soldier and injuring nine people, authorities said. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> claimed reponsibility. In a message to the <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> bureau of the British news agency, <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> said its guerrillas laid a bomb in the <PERSON> Inglis </PERSON> barracks in the wooded <LOCATION> Mill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> neighborhood. Police had said there was no immediate indication the 7 a.m. explosion was caused by a bomb. The barracks border the <LOCATION> Finchley </LOCATION> parliamentary constituency of Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, a prime <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> target. Two major hospitals in the area, <ORGANIZATION> Barnet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> and Edgware, reported admitting a total of nine injured, including one who was in an intensive care unit. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Ambulance spokesman <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> had said initially that 10 people were injured. He said the dead man was a soldier. Anti-terrorist police rushed to the barracks and sealed off the area after the explosion, which could be heard more than two miles away, ripped through a brick single men's dormitory block, the army said. Soldiers dug through rubble to rescue several of the injured who were trapped by falling masonry. One soldier was rescued after being trapped for more than 30 minutes. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Butt </PERSON>, commander of the postal section of the barracks, said the solider was saved by a radiator that shielded him from falling bricks and debris. <PERSON> Butt </PERSON> said most of the injured had burns or neck and back injuries. The blaze was under control two hours after the explosion, although pockets of flames remained late in the morning, said <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitty </PERSON>. Construction worker <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> McParland </PERSON>, who was working at the barracks, told reporters: `` The middle section of the living quarters is missing. It must have been a very big explosion.'' `` The building is where the single soldiers live _ that was where we were working. In the middle it just demolished it like a pack of cards. I guess about three-quarters of it is still standing.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> said the barracks housed members of the Women's <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> and also was used by the Postal and <ORGANIZATION> Courier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depot </ORGANIZATION> which is run by 250 staff from the corps, the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. All mail for British servicemen and women using the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> system passes through the depot. <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard Superintendent <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said 15 single men were housed in the barracks where the explosion occurred. `` There was an explosion at Inglis barracks in or near to the living quarters of army personnel,'' he said in a statement. `` There is one fatality, two seriously injured and several other injuries.'' `` It has been shattered,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said of the building. The predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>, which is fighting to end British rule in mainly <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, frequently attacks British military personnel. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> was `` deeply distressed to hear of the explosion'' when she arrived in <LOCATION> Perth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, on an official visit, her <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> office said. `` She is anxiously waiting for news of the people concerned and she sends deep sympathy for all the relatives concerned.'' In an interiew last week, <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s legal political wing <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> recognized that killing British soldiers made more impact in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> than killing policemen or soldiers from <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. `` So from that perspective, the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> certainly would like to target more British soldiers,'' he said. In May, after a 14-month lull, the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> resumed attacks on British army bases on the <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> continent. In the most recent attack, nine soldiers were injured on July 13 at <LOCATION> Duisburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Among the most serious <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> attacks on the army in mainland <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> were the July 20, 1982 double bombings in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Hyde </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> and Regent's Park killing 11 soldiers and seven of their horses.

 Joint U.S.-Vietnam efforts to account for 1,761 Americans still listed as missing from the Vietnam War could begin soon, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said today. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambertson </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> Affairs, made that assessment following four days of meetings in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> last week between Vietnamese officials and technical experts from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` While there are certain arrangments that will need to be worked out, we anticipate that joint activities, surveys, investigations and excavations could begin quite soon,'' <PERSON> Lambertson </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America'' program. `` We anticipate a substantially higher level of activity over the next three months,'' said <PERSON> Lambertson </PERSON>, who termed the talks `` quite productive.'' He said the sites that will be examined remain to be determined. In the talks last week, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> agreed to consider <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s humanitarian problems in exchange for Vietnamese cooperation on the MIA matter. A leader of the effort to resolve the cases of those still listed as missing in action said on the same program that her group views last week's meeting as a sign the Vietnamese hope to put the issue to rest. `` We hope the Vietnamese are serious,'' said <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffiths </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisoners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> War </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missing </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. `` I believe this time they are -LRB- serious -RRB- and I think they've recognized it's in their own national interest to cooperate in resolving this,'' she said Despite the increased cooperation, <PERSON> Lambertson </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s continued occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> remains as a barrier to normalization of relations between the two countries `` I believe the Vietnamese understand quite clearly that normalization is something the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would be prepared to enter into in the context of a <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> settlement that involves the complete withdrawal of Vietnamese forces from that country,'' <PERSON> Lambertson </PERSON> said. `` We also want one which contains very effective guarantees against a return to power of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. Representatives from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> resistance and other southeast Asian nations met in <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> last week to discuss an end to the nine-year-old conflict. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has pledged to withdraw its 120,000 troops by 1990. The Vietnamese withdrawal plan is `` a hopeful sign, but we also look at it with due skepticism,'' said <PERSON> Lambertson </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Griffiths </PERSON> said talks are quickening with other southeast Asian nations over MIAs. `` We have ongoing efforts with the <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> goverment. There are encouraging signs there as well, that the pace and level of cooperation is improving,'' she said. `` I think we'll shortly see consultations again between Lao and <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. officials.'' <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has denied allegations by some American private citizens that it is holding Americans captured in the war as prisoners.

 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said its troops withdrew from three Iranian border towns after disrupting supply lines and capturing prisoners, but <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said it repulsed the invaders. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said Sunday it will `` maintain our finger on the trigger'' until there is peace. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said it will refrain from attacking <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> shipping but will stay combat-ready after the 8-year-old war ends. Teams of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> experts were in the region to work out the particulars of a cease-fire. U.N.-mediated talks in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> were set to resume today. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio said Sunday that Iranian forces `` liberated'' the towns of Qasr-e <PERSON> Shirin </PERSON>, Sar-e Pol-e Zahab and <PERSON> Sumar </PERSON> and successfully countered what it described as a `` feeble enemy offensive'' farther north, killing or wounding hundreds of Iraqis. On Saturday, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> announced its forces had withdrawn from the three towns. The towns are not far from the border and have changed hands several times over the past 10 days, according to Iranian and Iraqi accounts. An Iraqi offensive Saturday night against the Iranian border town of <LOCATION> Mehran </LOCATION> farther south was repulsed with heavy losses, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported In <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> capital, the <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Al-Qadissiyah </ORGANIZATION> said that until `` genuine peace'' was assured, `` we will maintain our finger on the trigger.'' Similar articles appeared in two other government-run newspapers, <ORGANIZATION> Al-Jumhuriyah </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Al-Thawra </ORGANIZATION>. The editorials appeared aimed at dampening public expectations for peace soon. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> have been locked in dispute at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> over <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s demand for face-to-face talks before a truce under terms of U.N. Resolution 598. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has rejected direct talks until a cease-fire is achieved. In <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> on Sunday night, President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> told military commanders that even in time of peace, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> must keep a combat ready force so that enemies will not think of violating <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s rights, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> reported. Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Besharati </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, asked whether his country would continue to attack neutral ships in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, said: `` We will try to do our best not to violate anything ... so that Resolution 598 will come into reality.'' Until last week, Iranian vessels had been attacking neutral shipping in the southern gulf in retaliation for <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> attacks on oil tankers plying Iranian ports. <PERSON> Besharati </PERSON> made his comments in <LOCATION> Abu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dhabi </LOCATION>, in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The space shuttle launch team completed a practice countdown today despite a fuel leak that raised the possibility of another postponment of a critical test firing of Discovery's engines. The leak halted fueling of the shuttle's hydrogen tank after it had been loaded with 254,000 gallons, 67 percent of capacity. After assessing the situation, launch director <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Sieck </PERSON> ordered the countdown to proceed to obtain data on other aspects of the count. The liquid oxygen tank received a full load of 143,000 gallons and other procedures were rehearsed. The countdown was stopped as planned at 11 seconds before a mock liftoff by a simulated problem, and the launch team began practicing steps it would take to recover from a postponement _ making the shuttle safe, draining the propellants and turning the vehicle around for another countdown and launch attempt. A second countdown is to end with the test firing of Discovery's three main engines, with the shuttle bolted to the pad The firing had been scheduled for Thursday, but <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials said it might have to be delayed another day or so because of the leak. A decision on when to schedule the firing probably would not be made before Tuesday, <PERSON> Sieck </PERSON> said He said the launch team had done `` an excellent job'' in completing the countdown despite the difficulty. `` We must now evaluate the results and schedule the work that needs to be done before the firing,'' he added. The firing already had been postponed four times in 10 days. A three-day delay was announced Friday because of a hydrogen leak and a balky oxygen pump. The newest leak was in the same launch pad service mast as the earlier one, but officials would not know if it was in the same line until technicians traced it. They will not have access to the pad until after the launch team completes draining the hydrogen and oxygen Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said that despite Sunday's leak, it was satisfied that most requirements of the first part of the countdown had been met. Objectives missed were to be picked up during a second fueling and countdown for the test firing. Officials believe the practice countdown delays, combined with an unresolved leak in Discovery's steering engine system, will slip Discovery's launch date from mid-September into October. The purpose of the dual countdown test is to check modifications made to the engines and launch pad and to provide countdown practice for the launch team. The 20-second engine ignition is considered critical to certifying Discovery for the first shuttle flight since Challenger exploded shortly after liftoff on Jan. 28, 1986, killing the crew of seven. When the test is completed, officials of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> still must cope with the small gas leak in a steering engine system that is separate from Discovery's main engines. Engineers have come up with a plan to reach and repair the leak by entering the shuttle's cargo bay and cutting a hole through the rear bulkhead into the steering engine compartment. Another option, with a decision to be made after the test-firing, is to take Discovery off the pad and back to a hangar for repair, a move that could postpone the launch until November.

 <PERSON> Trinidad </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who portrayed a gang leader in the movie `` Colors'' and TV's `` Hill Street Blues,'' was killed in a crash that also injured his wife and son, police said. He was 38. <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>'s pickup truck was broadsided Sunday at an intersection by a car driven by a man who allegedly was drunk and who was arrested, said police Sgt. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Horsfall </PERSON>. <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Whittier </LOCATION>, was pronounced dead at the scene, said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Coroner's Office. In <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Hill Street Blues,'' <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> played the wise-cracking gang leader <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, who taunted Capt. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Furillo </PERSON> by calling him `` Frankie boy.'' He also portrayed `` Frog,'' an older gang leader in `` Colors,'' a performance the Hollywood Reporter called `` mesmerically engaging.'' `` From what we can tell, the arrested man went through a red light and broadsided Mr. <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>'s truck, and <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>'s truck spun around and hit the other vehicle,'' <PERSON> Horsfall </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>'s wife, <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION>, 28, and their 2-year-old son, <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON>, suffered minor injuries and were treated, said <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, a Presbyterian Intercommunity Hospital nursing supervisor. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, 35, of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Habra </LOCATION>, was booked for investigation of felony drunken driving, felony hit and run and vehicular manslaughter, <PERSON> Horsfall </PERSON> said.

 Syndicated columnist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>, a vocal gun control advocate, was expected to plead not guilty to handgun charges today in the shooting of a teen-ager who took an uninvited dip in <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>'s backyard pool in June. A group of <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>'s supporters gathered outside the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Courthouse </ORGANIZATION> before 9 a.m. to protest <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>'s prosecution. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>, 62, was charged last week with possessing an unregistered handgun and ammunition. He faces a penalty of up to two years in jail and $ 2,000 in fines if convicted. His attorney, <PERSON> Raoul </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> the columnist planned to ask to have his case heard before a <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury. `` We can communicate to them that <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who owned the gun, tried everything in his power to get the gun registered. District officials did not allow him to do it,'' <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> has said that his son, a former <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent, tried to register the weapon in 1982 but was told that it was n't necessary because he was a law-enforcement officer at the time. The elder <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> said he later obtained the gun from his son, at a time he was receiving threats. Except for law officers, District of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> law generally bans posession of handguns and ammunition not owned prior to 1976. The charges stem from the June 14 shooting of <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 18, of <LOCATION> Chevy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chase </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, who had climbed over <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>'s backyard fence to take a late-night swim in the columnist's pool. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> told police shot the intruder in the hand when he thought the teen was lunging at him. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was treated and released the same day at from <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>.

 Murder charges have been dropped against two brothers arrested shortly after men boarded a bus and opened fire, killing the driver and wounding three passengers, police said today. Sgt. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> also said two new suspects have been arrested in the slaying Friday of <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Givens </PERSON>. He described the suspects arrested Sunday night as a 17-year-old male and a 15-year-old male. Neither was identified. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, 25, and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, 29, were arrested about two hours after the shooting. Their mother, <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, 52, was killed Thursday in a collision with a bus driven by a rookie driver. Officers talked to witnesses and `` determined that the suspects were not either of the <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> brothers, and at about 4 p.m. -LRB- Sunday -RRB- we released them on the murder charges,'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said. But the brothers `` still have some warrant problems,'' and it was unclear if they had been released from jail, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said police had determined the teen-agers knew the <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> family, but he said there was no indication anyone in the family had a role in prompting the attack. <PERSON> Givens </PERSON>, 43, who worked for <ORGANIZATION> AC </ORGANIZATION> transit for 20 years, was struck several times with bullets from a semiautomatic .22 caliber rifle. Witnesses said four young men had stepped aboard <PERSON> Givens </PERSON>' bus, which carried 20 passengers, and shouted obscenities at the driver before firing 12 rounds.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> trustee plans to hold several auctions this month to sell silver coins, stamps and other valuables found in a vault at <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> headquarters. The sale comes as a Canadian real estate executive says he plans to pursue his offer to pay $ 113 million for <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> and operate it as a theme park with no religious overtones. Trustee M.C. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said the auctions would be Friday, Saturday and Aug. 12 at the Heritage Grand Hotel. Although the collection had been in the vault for some time, <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> first saw the inside of the vault July 25. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said he looked after deciding to sell assets to raise money for the financially troubled ministry and Christian retreat. `` I started the program of auctioning things we do n't need several weeks ago. The things in this vault are another part of that program,'' <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said. An appraiser has not completed evaluating the collection. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said the use of any money raised would be determined by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Rufus </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of bankruptcy laws more than a year ago. It owes creditors an estimated $ 130 million. The 15-by-16-foot vault contains small bars of 99.9 percent pure silver, a rack of fur coats, small statuettes of various metals and old money and stamps. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said other items that will be auctioned include pieces of heavy equipment <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> no longer uses and automobiles donated to the ministry. Canadian real estate executive <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> says <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> is ready to work with him, according to the Vancouver Sun. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, majority stockholder in Century 21 of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, told the newspaper, `` I believe now they'll give it -LRB- Heritage USA -RRB- to me.'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, 49, was born in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and grew up the <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> province of <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Construction Spending Edged Up 0.1 Percent in June</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Construction spending edged up 0.1 percent in June as continued strength in non-residential building offset declines in housing and government projects, the government said today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said building activity rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 402.8 billion in June, following a 0.8 percent increase in May. In April, construction plunged 1.1 percent after soaring 2.8 percent in March. The June level was 2.6 percent higher than a year ago. The strength came from a 2.5 percent increase in spending on non-residential construction, which climbed to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 99.2 billion, led by big jumps in both factory and hotel-motel construction. It was the fourth consecutive monthly increase. Factory construction rose 5.7 percent and now stands 21 percent higher than it was a year ago. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers have boosted investment on new factories because of a surge in export sales caused by the weaker dollar. Hotel and motel construction increased 19.4 percent after falling for two months. Construction of office buildings in June was off by 0.4 percent from the May level. However, the small decline followed increases in May, April and March, and the June rate was still 12 percent higher than a year ago, something of a puzzle to analysts because of lingering high vacancy rates in that sector caused by widespread overbuilding in previous years. Residential construction fell 0.9 percent in June to an annual rate of $ 188.1 billion, the third decline in a row. That sector has been hurt by an increase in mortgage interest rates since the spring. A 0.7 percent drop in construction of single-family homes more than offset a 2.3 percent increase in apartment construction. Government construction projects fell 1.4 percent in June to an annual rate of $ 78.6 billion with highway construction, the biggest segment of the government sector, suffering a 1.6 percent decline.

Mrs. <PERSON> Futch </PERSON> received her winnings in a lump sum and since has frittered the money away, relatives say. She bought a house to be near her youngest son, whom family members said she doted on. News reports at the time said she once tipped a man $ 7,000 just to play pool with her son.

 Four Soviet missiles were blown apart today at a test range on the steppes of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> began destroying more than 1,700 missiles banned by a superpower treaty, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, who today arrived for a four-day visit to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, hailed the destruction of the missiles as a `` great event.'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said that at noon <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> time, four Soviet short-range missiles known in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> as SS-12s were destroyed in the presence of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inspectors at the <LOCATION> Saryozek </LOCATION> test range in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>, about 1,800 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Western reporters watched from a distance of about two miles as a single explosion tore apart the four missiles. The blast dug a crater about 65 feet wide, and spread debris from the missiles over several hundred yards, they said. The explosion sent a huge cloud of smoke into the blue sky over the steppe, the Western reporters said. Col. <PERSON> Stanislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrenko </PERSON>, chief of operations, told reporters the nuclear warheads mounted on the SS-12s had been removed before the rockets were destroyed and that the charges would be used for peaceful purposes. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has used nuclear explosions for oil prospecting, large-scale construction projects and other purposes. <PERSON> Petrenko </PERSON> told Western reporters that an explosion would take place at the <LOCATION> Saryozek </LOCATION> site every day for the next 18 months. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the official Soviet news agency, said other Soviet missiles banned by the superpower treaty would be destroyed over the next three years. The superpowers signed a treaty in December banning their medium - and shorter-range nuclear missiles It is the first arms agreement between the two nations that calls for the destruction of an entire class of weaponry. Under the treaty, the Soviets must eliminate 1,752 missiles with a range of between 310 miles and 3,410 miles that have been deployed or are in storage, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has said it will scrap 859 <ORGANIZATION> Pershing </ORGANIZATION> 2 and cruise missiles now stationed in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty, signed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> general secretary <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, calls for each country to allow inspectors from the other side to verify that the rockets have been eliminated. On April 11, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> said it blew up six SS-12 missiles in a test designed to develop a method to destroy missiles under the treaty. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also conducted such tests. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, when asked by reporters how he evaluated the destruction of the missiles, said, `` I think it's a great event. I ` m very pleased to see it.'' His host, Soviet Defense Minister <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON>, added, `` It means that we are starting to carry out the obligations which were achieved earlier, especially as a result of the four summit meetings in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the destruction of the missiles `` will lead to a substantial lowering of the level of military confrontation in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and to the lessening of the risk of global nuclear conflict.''

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> deported eight Palestinians today, the military said, as fellow Palestinians in the occupied territories held a commercial strike to protest the Israeli policy of expulsions. The deportations came a day after <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> announced he was severing ties with the 850,000 Arabs in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> he once ruled. The eight Palestinians were visited by their families at Jneid Prison in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> before being driven away, relatives said. A military spokesman said they were taken to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s northern border with <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Among the deportees was a journalist with <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s Arabic language <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Fajr </PERSON> newspaper, <PERSON> Loui </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdo </PERSON>, who was accused of leading a Palestine Liberation Organization-linked youth group in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, security sources said. Other deportees included a lecturer from the <ORGANIZATION> Bir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> and a labor leader from nearby <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bireh </LOCATION>, they said. The expulsions brought to 29 the number of Palestinians deported since the beginning of the eight-month Arab uprising. Some Palestinians denounced <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> today as a traitor for severing ties with them, but others praised the monarch for ceding to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> as their sole representative. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s decision to divorce himself from the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> dealt a blow to the idea of a united <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> nation. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> said in his speech he intended to cut legal and administrative ties with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, which he ruled before losing the area to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> during the 1967 Middle East War. The decision was a setback for Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>' <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which had proposed resolving the dispute with the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> by negotiations with <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> A government official today disclosed that <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> had tried through foreign intermediaries to persuade <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> not to break ties. In at least two <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> cities, Arabs scribbled slogans on walls denouncing <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>. `` Down With <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, The Traitor,'' one said in the city of <LOCATION> Tulkarm </LOCATION>. Other Palestinians disagreed. `` It's a good gesture for the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> and it should start the ball rolling in the direction of working out strategic relationships between the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> on the future,'' <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> journalist <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuttab </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Nazareth </LOCATION> daily A-Sinara told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, speaking to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>'s new ambassador, said <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> had `` dealt a blow'' to the idea of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state by differentiating between Palestinians living on the east bank of the <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and those in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. `` If as <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> says one part of them has to set up a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state and another part is <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> ... where then is the one Palestinian people,'' an aide quoted <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> as saying. `` It is possible to draw the conclusion that the whole idea of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> people is an invention for the sake of propaganda,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc opposes territorial concessions to the Arabs and believes the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> are integral parts of the historic land of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said the effect of <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s announcement was still not known because he had not said how he would carry out his decision. But analysts said <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s speech may hurt the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in November elections. The <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> `` can exploit this and claim <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>' concept of negotiations with <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> has collapsed,'' said <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> expert <PERSON> Aryeh </PERSON> <PERSON> Shalev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, while not ruling out the likelihood that <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> would take part in negotiations, made it clear the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> must speak for themselves. A government official close to <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> had tried through foreign diplomats to dissuade <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> from making his speech, telling them <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> `` still believes in a need for peace talks with <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>.'' The Israeli daily <ORGANIZATION> Haaretz </ORGANIZATION> said one of the intermediaries was British Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, who it said passed a message from <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> to <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> last month. Editorials in Palestinian-owned newspapers voiced confusion over <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s plans. Some were fearful <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> could cancel Jordanian passports held by many of the 850,000 Palestinians in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> or even close bridges connecting the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, a vital economic link to the Arab world.

 <ORGANIZATION> Allstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> enacted a smoking ban today in its 5,800 buildings and agent offices nationwide, becoming one of the largest companies to do so.

The company has not decided what action to take with customers who smoke. No-smoking signs will be posted in all offices, and there will be no ashtrays. But a spokeswoman said there is no order to tell customers who insist on smoking to refrain from doing so. The company based in this <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb initially tried to establish no-smoking sections, said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, vice president of human resources, but later decided the compromise did not meet its needs. `` This is definitely one of the largest companies to take this kind of a stand,'' said <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lung </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Allstate </ORGANIZATION> employees and family members who smoke were offered reimbursements up to $ 200 if they sought to quit through no-smoking programs.

 Fifteen teen-agers from four high schools are burning the midnight oil and working Saturdays for a shot at winning a $ 1 million supercomputer for their school. `` We had to twist their arms to let us stay until 2 a.m.,'' said contestant <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldmeier </PERSON>, 18, who just graduated from <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Logan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>.

The students' projects range from complex analyses of how to design computer problems to a model of school hall traffic. All seek to take advantage of a supercomputer's capacity to make millions of calculations far more quickly than other computers. <PERSON> Maneesh </PERSON> <PERSON> Agrawala </PERSON>, 16, is using the computer to create mathematical models of proteins. <PERSON> Agrawala </PERSON>, who will be a junior this fall at <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Silver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Spring </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, is the son of a computer science professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> and began programming small computers in the seventh grade.

 All Western hostages may be released from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> by the end of the year, an Australian archbishop predicted today after a mission to the Iranian capital. Also today, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is reviewing its relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, including the possibility of sending a diplomat to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. `` I would not be surprised if <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> and the others were released before the end of the year,'' Archbishop <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Penman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Melbourne </LOCATION> told reporters in <LOCATION> Canterbury </LOCATION>. `` It's my intuition that it -LRB- the hostages' release -RRB- will come after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Israeli elections'' in November, said <PERSON> Penman </PERSON>, who visited <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> en route to <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>, the envoy of Archbishop of Canterbury <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON>, disappeared in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> on Jan. 20, 1987 while seeking the release of American hostages. Eighteen Westerners, including nine Americans, are missing after apparent kidnappings by pro-Iranian groups in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The longest held is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 40, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, who was abducted March 16, 1985. A <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the review in relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was prompted in part by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s acceptance of a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> resolution calling for a cease-fire in its 8-year-old war against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. `` British ministers are reviewing the whole gambit of Anglo-Iranian relations including the possibility of sending a diplomat to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> for a short period of time,'' the spokesman said. He spoke on condition of anonymity. On Sunday, the Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> disclosed that the Rt. Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, bishop of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> region, went to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> last week seeking word on four Iranians who disappeared there in 1982. They were presumed kidnapped by <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> militia and some reports have said they are dead. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said he hopes his mission contributed to efforts to win the release of foreign hostages. `` It's very important to us when we are talking to the Iranians ... to show them that we are concerned about their missing people as well as ours,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. He said he met with the leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and the Armenian church community and `` they have promised to make inquiries of their own communities.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s only diplomat in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, charge d'affaires <PERSON> Akunzadeh </PERSON> <PERSON> Basti </PERSON>, had a meeting at the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> today and said afterward <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would use its influence to get information about the hostages. <PERSON> Basti </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> hoped to normalize relations with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. `` I think a better atmosphere is developing,'' he said. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> recently settled a dispute over compensation for damages to diplomatic buildings in each other's countries. A delegation of British parliamentarians also visited <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> to discuss improving relations. Among the British hostages are journalist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, kidnapped in April 1986, and teacher <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON>, who disappeared the same month. <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> also holds Irish citizenship.

 The Burmese government announced today it arrested the country's most prominent dissident and nine other people to prevent an attack against the state. Official <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> radio, monitored in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, said action would be taken against dissident <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON> and the nine others `` according to criminal law procedures.'' The broadcast did not mention <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> correspondent Sein Win or several other people said to have been detained in a sweep last week. `` In order to prevent an attack against the state, as preventative measures, authorities ... detained <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON> and his associates ... as from July 29, 1988,'' the announcement said. It was the first official word of the arrests, which had been reported by Western diplomats in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s capital, and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The men listed in the broadcast were retired military officers, many of whom had supported former leader Ne Win in his early years in power. Most are in their mid - to late 60s Ne Win resigned abruptly last month after 26 years of authoritarian rule. He was replaced by <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, a former general known for his brutal suppression of dissent. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> today reportedly made an official inquiry into the status of <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> correspondent <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON>, who diplomats said was being held with the others at Insein prison on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. Leaflets circulated by student groups in the city, meanwhile, called for a nationwide strike Aug. 8 against the current regime, Western diplomatic sources said. The sources, who asked not to be further identified, said at least some of the leaflets came from the <ORGANIZATION> All </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Universities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, which has been demanding the removal of new leader <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON>, 70, emerged this year as the most outspoken critic of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s government through a series of letters he wrote decrying economic and political conditions in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. In the letters, which were widely circulated in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON> singled out <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> for `` turning a blind eye'' to gross human rights abuses during bloody student riots last March and June. The radio broadcast said those arrested along with the 70-year-old <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON> were <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> <PERSON> Han </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tun </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Ba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shwe </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Khin </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tun </PERSON> <PERSON> Shwe </PERSON>, <PERSON> Chit </PERSON> <PERSON> Ko </PERSON> <PERSON> Ko </PERSON>, <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON> and Zaw Win.

I believe that people should talk,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from his home. He said he was `` concerned that in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> because of -LRB- <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>'s -RRB- attacks, we missed a great opportunity to discuss urban policy in this country.'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>'s criticism last April included a statement that Jews would be `` crazy'' to vote for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who supports Palestinian self-determination. `` My feelings toward the mayor are always open and respectful,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` His toward me were very hostile.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> `` used race and religion as litmus test and divided the city and helped to lower the moral tone of the campaign.'' He said he told <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> that if they are to meet, it should be arranged through <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> borough president, and Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON>, and the meeting should include black leaders such as those two, both of whom are <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporters. `` The leaders ought to meet and work out a common agenda,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said he would call <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> to arrange a meeting with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> `` as soon as possible so we could get behind <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said he was not trying to line up support among blacks _ through <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> _ for his own re-election campaign next year. `` I'm not in contention this year,'' he said. `` And if you really believe as I do that it's important to have a Democrat in the White House, you set aside those differences.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> told a top-level Soviet military class today he has difficulty reconciling <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> claims of a defensive strategy with its excessive military spending and offensive weapons stocks. On the first day of a visit expected to offer a close-up view of some Soviet bases and hardware, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> and his host, Defense Minister <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON>, both called for straight talk on the issues that divide their nations. Speaking at <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Voroshilov </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> academy </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said questions remain `` by and large open'' on the sincerity of Soviet claims to be rethinking defense strategy. `` We have difficulty in reconciling a defensive doctrine with what we see in Soviet force structure and operational strategy as an emphasis on the offensive,'' he told the academy class. `` We also have difficulty reconciling the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION>'s pledge not to be the first to use nuclear weapons with your continuing emphasis on heavy ICBMs -LRB- intercontinental ballistic missiles -RRB-, such as the SS-18,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said. He said he found <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> and other senior <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> military men `` articulate and willing,'' but deemed the signs of actual change in the system `` ambiguous.'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said the Strategic Defense Initiative, known as `` Star Wars,'' would remain part of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military plan as long as <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> sees on the Soviet side `` a capability more compatible with a military doctrine that emphasizes pre-emptive nuclear strikes.'' At the opening of his talks with <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> called for `` talk in direct terms'' about the superpowers' divergent views on defense. `` Yes, we are soldiers,'' <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> agreed, with a decisive nod of the head. The first session between the superpower defense chiefs included Soviet Chief of Staff Marshal <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON>, who last month completed a tour of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense installations that set the tone of openness being accorded to <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> here. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense chief said he was `` totally satisfied'' with the access he will be given to military bases and equipment during his four-day visit. At the beginning of July, <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON> saw flight operations on the aircraft carrier USS <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>, the inside of a B-1 bomber and toured a Minuteman missile training facility. In return, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials let it be known that they wanted to see the Soviets' top-secret Blackjack bomber and visit Soviet ships at sea. <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> said he believed <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>'s program will include a look at the Blackjack bomber `` among other military hardware.'' The <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> meetings will be the third session between the defense chiefs of the superpowers. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> first met in <LOCATION> Berne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, in March, and they also held talks during the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit in late May. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> is accompanied by Assistant Secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON> and representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Soviet media have focused much attention on <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>'s visit, promising a closeup look at the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>'s military installations and declaring the exchange a good chance to ease tensions between the superpowers. `` In the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> they attach much importance to contacts between the military of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, since those contacts aim at improving mutual understanding of military aspects of Soviet-American relations, at solving the most important problem of today _ the prevention of a nuclear war and cessation of the arms race,'' the official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said today. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> is to go Tuesday to the Taman base outside the capital and to the <LOCATION> Kubinka </LOCATION> airfield _ both in closed zones normally off-limits to foreigners. On Wednesday, the delegation flies to the Crimean peninsula for the American side's first official look at the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> fleet headquartered in <LOCATION> Sevastopol </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> leaves the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on Thursday for <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>.

 Three days after warring gang members ended truce talks with a call for a week of peace and prayer, two people were killed and at least five other people were injured in gang-related violence, police said. Police said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Randle </PERSON>, 18, of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, was the first person to die since members of two street gangs, the Crips and the Bloods, met last week and called on other members to refrain from violence for one week and observe seven days of prayer. <PERSON> Randle </PERSON> died Sunday, about an hour after he was shot while standing with a group of people in a parking lot, said police Sgt. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRoche </PERSON>. An estimated 15 shots were fired from a passing car police believe was filled with suspected Crips gang members, <PERSON> LaRoche </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> on Monday blamed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators for a lack of progress on the proposed emigration to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of thousands of former political prisoners and their relatives. Talks were held July 14-15 by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Vietnamese negotiators in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> on resettlement of people who were put into `` re-education camps'' because of ties to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> during the Vietnam War, and a joint communique issued at the time indicated an agreement had been reached. The official <ORGANIZATION> Vietnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> `` showed its goodwill and readiness to cooperate with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side in solving the question as soon as possible. However, the discussions brought about no result due to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side's negative attitude.'' `` The two sides are continuing to discuss the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side's guarantee that it shall not ... tolerate any hostile activities against <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> by the released re-education camp inmates when they are resettled in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said the report, monitored in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> `` The biggest obstacle lies in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side's refusal to set up a working group to organize the emigration to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of about 500,000 people, including relatives of the released inmates, and to oversee the execution of this commitment.'' Previous Western news reports from <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> have said that the emigration of 50,000 people, not 500,000, was discussed. Details on the working group proposal were not available. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not extend diplomatic recognition to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and has resisted Vietnamese attempts to establish official contact. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> says it wo n't consider relations until <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> pulls its more than 100,000 troops from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. After the talks in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Vietnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> released the text of a joint communique that suggested an agreement had been reached. The communique said <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> was allowing the former detainees to leave after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government gave assurances it wo n't encourage them to engage in anti-Vietnam activities. It said both sides hoped that processing of the former detainees can begin within the next several months. It said they discussed ways to expedite applications. The talks were conducted by teams led by <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Tran </PERSON> <PERSON> Quang </PERSON> <PERSON> Co </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Funseth </PERSON>, senior deputy assistant secretary of state for refugee programs. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> first offered to resettle the former prisoners in 1984. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest was renewed after <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s new leadership freed hundreds of former <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> officials in 1987 and this year. The North Vietnamese established the camps, which usually combined manual labor with ideological study, after defeating U.S.-backed South <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in 1975. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> estimates that 900,000 former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government employees or <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> officials have spent time in the camps.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Rules Against Dance Ban</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge today ruled unconstitutional the school dance ban that has been in effect in tiny Prudy for at least a century. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> stopped short, however, of ordering the school board to hold dances for students. `` It would be inappropriate for this court to order the district to sponsor school dances. However, a district rule prohibiting students from holding dances on school property infringes on the First Amendment rights of the students and must be invalidated,'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said in the decision that followed four days of testimony in June. He awarded the plaintiffs _ 21 students and their parents _ $ 1 in nominal damages and attorney fees and ordered the school board not to enforce its ban on dancing. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleischaker </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> lawyer from <PERSON> Joplin </PERSON>, who represented those who favored dances, said the school board could still ban dancing if it could present reasons other than the written rule and religious reasons. But he said he felt it would be `` foolish'' of the school board to try to stop dances on school property. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, 16, student body president for the upcoming school year, said she would try to organize a dance for the start of the school term next month. `` I think the only change will be we'll have some dances and we'll have some fun. I hope there wo n't be any bad attitudes,'' she said after <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>'s ruling. School officials could not immediately be reached for comment. The school board lawyer was with a client, and members of the school board did not answer their telephones. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said he found the testimony of school board members `` incredible.'' `` The entire board candidly admits that they followed the will of the majority, but they were not candid in their opinions of the religious reasoning of the majority,'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> wrote. `` This court is skeptical that it heard the complete story concerning the board members' deliberations of the rule and the religious significance of the opposition to dancing in <LOCATION> Purdy </LOCATION>,'' his order said. The pro-dancers sued the school board in 1986, maintaining the dance ban was inspired by a religious bias against dancing. But school board members testified that the community of 900 people southwest of <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> opposed dancing for a number of reasons that had little to do with religion, including the belief that dancing leads to drinking and other discipline problems. The school board handbook states simply: `` School dances are not authorized and school premises shall not be used for purposes of conducting a dance.'' <ORGANIZATION> Purdy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> proms have been held in neighboring communities, prompting some parents to complain that their children were put into danger by being forced to drive 30 miles or more to dance. In recent decades, senior classes have made a ritual of asking the school to allow a dance and being refused. But the class of 1986 proved more persistent. Students that year signed a petition in support of a school dance to publicize a local chapter of Students Against Drunk Driving. They asked their parents' help and sought media attention when they took the request before the school board. They were met with resistance organized in local churches _ so many people were drawn to the meeting at which the ban was challenged that it had to be moved to the high school gymnasium. The school board, lobbied by anti-dancing ministers, voted unanimously to uphold the ban. Dance supporters followed with a rally to which they invited stars of the movie `` Footloose,'' a movie about a fictional <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> town where dancing was banned. Actors <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lori </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON> were unable to attend.

The man, <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Mesa </PERSON>, 40, of the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, was charged with disorderly conduct and unlawful dealing with fireworks, said Sgt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> carried business cards that proclaimed, `` Living on the edge is my business _ <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s No. 1 Stuntman,'' <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> was taken to <LOCATION> Beekman-Downtown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Center </LOCATION> for psychiatric observation. He told reporters he performed the stunt to show that handicapped people can `` do anything.'' Alerted by the crew of a tugboat, a police harbor unit, emergency service officers and ambulance personnel rushed to the landmark 105-year-old bridge, which connects <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>. Bomb squad officials were also called after a report the man may have been carrying a couple of pipe bombs. <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> was carrying two bags which contained six super M-80's, each the equivalent of quarter-stick of dynamite, <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> said. The bridge was reopened when <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> surrendered, but closed again briefly later while the police bomb squad checked for explosives that might have been left on the bridge.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said today he hopes to reach bipartisan agreement this week on a new aid package for <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Contra rebels, but it remained unclear whether the measure would include new weapons. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said the matter could come before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> by mid-week, when lawmakers will take up a supplemental money bill, or late in the week when they begin work on a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> funding `` The Democrats have not finalized a plan yet,'' <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> told reporters. `` I hope we can reach consensus among Democrats and then go to the Republican leader and see if we can get bipartisan agreement.'' Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said it was an encouraging sign that the Democrats are working on a proposal to give military aid to the Contras if the Sandinista government does not honor its peace pledges. It `` certainly does seem to signal that the Democrats and others are concerned about the recent actions of President -LRB- <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, that they recognize the fact <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> has turned his back on the peace process and has started clamping down on all these various freedoms,'' said <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. He said the administration would work with Democrats and others `` to get an acceptable plan.'' Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., has proposed a $ 47 million aid package for the anti-Sandinista rebels, including $ 20 million in standby military aid that could be triggered by a later congressional vote The package has been endorsed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, for whom the Contras have been a top foreign policy priority. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> today pronounced himself `` eager to hear what -LRB- the Democrats -RRB- have in mind'' and urged <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> drafters to include a reliable delivery system in their aid plan. While diplomatic negotiations are the key to peace in the region, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said, sustaining the rebels as `` a credible presence at the bargaining table'' is essential to the success of any talks. Costa Rican President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> is at work on a plan to bring the two sides back together following the breakdown of negotiations in June. Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and a consistent supporter of the rebel military effort, said Sunday Democrats are at work on a proposal to give military aid to the Contras if the leftist <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> government does not honor the peace pledges it has made `` There's an effort right now going on among <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats to come forward with our own proposal,'' <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> said Sunday on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Meet the Press. `` As I said, one that would be balanced, that would hold out the stick, the possibility of a resumption of military aid if the <LOCATION> Sandinistas </LOCATION> continue to violate the peace pledges they've made.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said in Monday's editions that the Democratic plan calls for a release of $ 18 million in frozen military aid to the Contras if the Sandinistas violate provisions of the regional peace plan reached almost exactly a year ago. But prospects for ultimate passage of any new aid remained clouded. House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said today the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would wait to see what senators agree on before taking any action. He added: `` I still tend to doubt there will be votes in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to resume the war.'' The prospects for renewed aid in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> generally reflect the increased polarization in the region, where the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have cracked down harshly on opponents and a newly reconstituted Contra leadership has taken a harder line. <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> plan would prohibit further votes on the Contra-aid issue this year. That would in large part remove the controversial issue from the presidential campaign. Under the proposal being drafted by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, $ 18 million in lethal aid already appropriated but frozen would be released if the Sandinista government made an unprovoked attack on the Contras. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said the $ 18 million figure did not square with information he has received from the administration, and that actual residual weapons stores were less. The exact figure is classified. The paper quoted <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> as saying the lethal aid already exists in warehouses outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The president would determine when an unprovoked attack is made. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> voted $ 100 million in military aid to the Contras in late 1986 _ $ 60 million to be delivered beginning in February 1987, the rest in 1988. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> froze delivery on Feb. 29 to ensure the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> did not subvert the regional peace plan signed by all five <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidents, including <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>.

 Backburns and wind ballooned fires in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> today, where more than 125,500 acres already have burned, and in <LOCATION> Bighorn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> to the east, firefighters worked to control blazes charring 1,800 acres. A timber fire that burned 3,840 acres over six days in the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> on the edge of <LOCATION> Rapid </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, was declared controlled Sunday night. A fire is considered controlled when it is reduced to smoldering patches. Crews used hand tools and turned over logs to crush out the last embers of that arson-suspected blaze. Fires burned still in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, fires that forced the closure of some areas of the park last week began to calm over the weekend, leaving firefighters battling only two, the 11,600-acre Fan fire in the park's northwestern corner and the North Fork fire west of Old Faithful. But on Sunday, high wind combined with backburning intended to stop the blazes fanned the North Fork fire from 11,300 acres to 18,200 in 24 hours, said <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> LaOrange </PERSON>, a fire information officer. Today about 360 firefighters were sent back to re-establish the lines along the southern and eastern edges of the fire, said fire information officer <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Blade </PERSON>. Also jumping substantially in size was the Fan Fire, which grew from 7,500 acres to 11,600, said <PERSON> LaOrange </PERSON>. Areas of the park closed by the fires, including the park's south entrance closed by the 12,000-acre Shoshone fire and the 11,400-acre Red fire, re-opened Sunday, although the road from the park's south entrance was closed periodically throughout the day But in the <ORGANIZATION> Bighorn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, officials were hampered by winds and were expecting manpower problems as they tried to control an estimated 1,800-acre fire. In <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, cooler weather helped firefighters today near containment on the 5,000-acre <LOCATION> Willis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulch </LOCATION> Fire in the <ORGANIZATION> Boise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, and crews using hand tools battled another west-central <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> blaze still growing in rugged, remote terrain near Cascade. About 90 percent of the <LOCATION> Willis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulch </LOCATION> fire's 10-mile perimeter was surrounded by cleared fire lines early today. `` It's coming along really well,'' <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawthorne </PERSON> said. `` The weather is cooperating a lot. It's a lot cooler.'' More than 1,150 people were committed to the 7-day-old blaze about 35 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION> in a drive to contain it by tonight. The fire has destroyed $ 7.5 million worth of timber and other resources and cost over $ 1 million to fight so far. Priority was being shifted to the 3-day-old <LOCATION> Riordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> fire, also in the <ORGANIZATION> Boise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Hawthorne </PERSON> said. The lightning-caused blaze had consumed 110 acres by early today. Cooler weather also gave <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state firefighters help in containing two fires burning in old-growth trees and felled timber in the <LOCATION> Cascade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>, while a fire line was established around a 55-acre blaze on the Olympic Peninsula despite high wind. Containment of the 3,600-acre <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> fire along the crest of the Cascades, originally predicted for Sunday evening, was expected by tonightm said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. A crew battling a 400-acre fire in the northern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> desert expected to contain that later today, said <ORGANIZATION> Interagency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> dispatcher <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>. Crews fought the stubborn <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> fire in southwestern <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, and a camper was in custody on suspicion of leaving an unattended fire that started the fire on July 22. The fire had expanded to 3,150 acres by Sunday night, and was expected to be contained by Tuesday, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnier </PERSON>.

 A Hungarian daily on Monday deplored a shortage of newsprint that is forcing publications to limit the size of some newspapers at a time of increased political openness and interest in the press. `` This is a sad state of affairs,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Magyar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nemzet </ORGANIZATION> daily commented in an editorial, saying it would be cutting the paper's size four times a week It said the shortages resulted from foreign partners _ `` mainly the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'' _ being unable to meet their exports. The newspaper deplored that `` at a time when the country's political developments have reached a point where ... more openness, straightforward words and sincerity are needed, when the news is a necessity like bread, ... the newsprint situation of the country should have become catastrophic. <ORGANIZATION> Magyar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nemzet </ORGANIZATION> has been testing the limits of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s new openness, interviewing dissidents and reporting on sensitive issues such as environmental problems and relations with <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Magyar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nemzet </ORGANIZATION> has a circulation of 97,000 copies daily.

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is continuing to use mustard and nerve gas `` on an intensive scale'' in its eight-year war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> despite frequent pleas that it cease, according to a report by a team of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> experts released today. `` The secretary-general can not but express his deep regret at the mission's conclusion that chemical weapons continue to be used against Iranian forces and positions,'' <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said in a statement. There was no immediate reaction from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and the Iraqi Mission said officials were not available. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> talks on ending the Iran-Iraq war, last month acknowledged that <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> soldiers used chemical weapons. Ambassador <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ja'afar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said today that the report `` only refers to allegations against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, only cites nine soldiers.'' He added he hoped the report `` will only further motivate the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to exert all pressure and leverage against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to accept a cease-fire and comprehensive settlement.'' The secretary-general is conducting talks with both sides on ending their war and implementing a cease-fire. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> inquiry was requested by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which charged that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> had used the weapons frequently and on a massive scale, killing thousands of people in the spring. At <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s request, the team later went to <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. The team said it examined <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> soldiers who had been injured by mustard gas, but did not conclude that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> used chemical weapons. Earlier <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> reports also have documented use of the weapons by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> government has admitted using chemical weapons. Iranian officials had denied using the weapons. `` The danger of continuing escalation involving the use of those weapons of mass destruction, in violation of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> Protocol and in spite of repeated findings ... and numerous appeals, is a frightening possibility which must be fully faced by all concerned and the international community as a whole,'' the secretary-general's statement said. In May the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> condemned the increasing use of chemical weapons in the Iran-Iraq war and urged restraint by both sides. `` We deeply regret to say that ... in spite of repeated appeals by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, chemical weapons continue to be used on an intensive scale against Iranian forces,'' the report by chemical warfare specialists said. The 53-page report consists of two parts based on visits to both <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> at the requests of the two government. It said clinical examinations of nine <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> soldiers showed their injuries had been produced by mustard gas. The Iraqis displayed mortar grenades that showed evidence of mustard gas and said they had been used by the Iranians, the team said. The section on <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s use of the weapons is more detailed, involving more patients and locations and studies of chemical bomb fragments. The report describes numerous injuries caused by mustard gas, but said the investigators could not confirm reports of nerve gas use because it disappears quickly. The medical chief and others in an Iranian war zone told the investigators that because it dissipates quickly and allows attackers to advance, the nerve gas was used against front line troops. They said mustard gas was used against rear areas to disrupt possible counterattacks because of its lasting effects. The team visited <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> from July 1 to 5, went to hospitals in <LOCATION> Bakhtaran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ahvas </LOCATION> and traveled to the war zone in the southwest. It visited <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> on July 10 and 11 and visited hospitals in As <LOCATION> Sulaymaniyah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. The team consisted of two chemical weapons specialists, Dr. <PERSON> Erik </PERSON> <PERSON> Dahlgren </PERSON> of the Swedish <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Umea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, and Dr. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Dominguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmona </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Universidad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Complutense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Madrid </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>.

 A man awaiting sentencing for kidnapping and raping a youngster has been charged with abducting two boys, molesting one, and trying to abduct a girl during a 24-hour spree through two states. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> Weymouth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, had been free on $ 3,000 bail while awaiting sentencing for the rape and kidnapping of a boy in <LOCATION> Hingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neil </PERSON>. `` I think this well demonstrates the need for bail reform,'' <PERSON> O'Neil </PERSON> said at a press conference Sunday. <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON>, said he had received psychiatric treatment as an outpatient and had gone to a counseling session Thursday. `` There was no indication that anything was wrong,'' she said. <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> was arrested Saturday night shortly after a 6-year-old boy was returned to his home here. The boy had been pushed into a stranger's car Friday evening while walking home from a library with his older brother and a friend. <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> was being held at the Adult Correctional Institutions in <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>. He was ordered held without bail at arraignment today in <LOCATION> Kent </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION> on charges including two counts of kidnapping, burglary, child molestation, assault with a dangerous weapon, possession of a stolen vehicle, reckless driving and eluding arrest, said Detective Capt. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Burlingame </PERSON>. No plea was entered, said Cmdr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulhearn </PERSON>. The spree began early Friday when a man broke into a <ORGANIZATION> Warwick </ORGANIZATION> house, pointed a flashlight in the eyes of a sleeping 10-year-old boy, and forced the boy at knifepoint to leave with him, <LOCATION> Burlingame </LOCATION> said. The boy's parents were sleeping. The child was molested and then released to find his way home, <LOCATION> Burlingame </LOCATION> said. Later Friday, a man tried to abduct an 11-year-old girl in <LOCATION> Bellingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, police said. He grabbed the girl by the arm, but she broke free, and he drove off. The man returned to <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, pulling the 6-year-old off the sidewalk two blocks from his home, police said. That abduction triggered a search of the <LOCATION> Warwick </LOCATION> area by about 125 local, state and federal authorities, aided by civilian groups. When the boy was returned, police chased the suspect who fled by car and then on foot. <LOCATION> Burlingame </LOCATION> said all three children have identified <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>. The detective also said police in several other communities are interested in questioning <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> in connection with abductions within the last six weeks. In the <LOCATION> Hingham </LOCATION> case, <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> pleaded guilty June 2 to abducting a 12-year-old boy in November 1987, tying him to a tree in a state park and molesting him. Mrs. <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Weymouth </LOCATION>, said her son was `` a confused child who was raped when he was 12.'' <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, 17, who lives near the <ORGANIZATION> Gardners </ORGANIZATION> in the middle-class neighborhood near downtown <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, called <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> `` an introverted person.'' `` He always hung around by himself. He never had any friends his own age, never any girlfriends or anything like that. No one his own age ever went near him,'' <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> said. `` He was like a social outcast.''

 A witness said Monday hundreds of people were standing on a section of ferry pier when it collapsed onto a ramp packed with cars and motorcycles, killing at least 31 people and injuring more than 800. <PERSON> Cheong </PERSON> <PERSON> Ah </PERSON> <PERSON> Chye </PERSON>, 21, was one of thousands waiting to board the ferry Sunday evening to attend a Chinese religious festival on <LOCATION> Penang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, about three miles away, and said he was only about a yard from the section that collapsed. The ferry has an upper deck for passengers and a lower level for cars, trucks and motorcycles. <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Naga </PERSON> <PERSON> Rajan </PERSON>, a journalist for the daily <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penang </ORGANIZATION>, said he had stepped onto the ferry only seconds before the disaster. He said hundreds of people had jammed the boarding area of the pier, justling and clambering over barriers. <PERSON> Rajan </PERSON> said: `` I had just stepped onto the ferry when I heard a loud noise. I turned around and saw that the portion from the beginning of the pathway to the ferry and the area around the sliding gate had fallen. `` I rushed down to the vehicle section of the ferry and saw that the whole platform around the area _ iron beams, planks and wires _ had collapsed with the people on it. It fell on vehicles on the lower floor going into the ferry. `` Then I saw people, bleeding in the head, face, arms and legs emerging from the debris. Many were covered with dirt and all were in shock. `` Some mothers, their faces bleeding, were looking for their children. Some people were crying, others offered prayers. A number of people were trapped under the iron beams and debris. Soon police and firemen arrived to pull them out.'' <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Noorani </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamarun </PERSON>, deputy secretary of <LOCATION> Penang </LOCATION> state and head of the rescue operation, told reporters Monday that earlier reports of 35 dead were wrong. He said 31 people had been killed, including 13 who died in hospitals. He said only three of the casualties had been found to be foreigners: two from <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and a French tourist with minor injuries. Prime Minister <PERSON> Mahathir </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohamad </PERSON> flew to <PERSON> Butterworth </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Kuala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lumpur </LOCATION>, the capital city 180 miles to the southeast, and visited the injured at a government hospital. <PERSON> Mahathir </PERSON> said an immediate payment of about $ 800 would be made to the family of each of the dead and other compensation might be provided. Rescue officials said most of the debris had been cleared away and no more bodies or survivors were expected to be found. <PERSON> Butterworth </PERSON> has two ferry piers. The one remaining intact resumed operation Monday after a safety inspection. Only passengers were allowed on the pier. Vehicles were ordered to use the bridge that links this port of 50,000 people to <LOCATION> Penang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> across the Strait of <LOCATION> Malacca </LOCATION>. The rescue center said all but two of the dead had been indentified and the total number injured was 863, including 417 still hospitalized.

 <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> voters are being asked Tuesday whether they want to bet on casino gambling as a ticket to prosperity, while Missourians decide whether to bail out their state lottery by enriching the jackpot. In other primary voting in three states, two Republican ex-congressmen compete for the right to challenge <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s liberal Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, and a former <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> first lady, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearnes </PERSON>, bids for a chance to become that state's first woman governor <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> also has primaries, with contests in three of five congressional districts. The only incumbent challenged in a primary is GOP Rep. <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyers </PERSON>, who is seeking a third term in the 3rd District. She is favored over <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON>. `` Bat'' <PERSON> Masterson </PERSON>, 73, a retired school administrator. Two well-known names appear on <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> primary ballots. Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> filed at the last minute for a seventh term after dropping his presidential bid. Most of the Democrats who had entered the 3rd District race then withdrew, but three little-known contenders remained on the ballot. And in the 8th District, farm activist <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Cryts </PERSON>, who gained national attention in 1981 taking soybeans out of a padlocked, bankrupt grain elevator, will seek the Democratic nomination to oppose Republican Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON>. Cryts lost to <LOCATION> Emerson </LOCATION> by 8,000 out of 150,000 votes cast in 1986. Missouri's 2 -LCB- - year-old lottery suffered a $ 24 million drop in sales during the last fiscal year, and officials are blaming restrictions specifying that exactly 45 percent of lottery proceeds go for prizes and 10 percent for administrative costs, including advertising A measure on the ballot would amend the rules, making prize money a minimum of 45 percent of proceeds and allowing the state to spend more on advertising. Proponents say that would make the lottery more appealing and increase sales. Mrs. <PERSON> Hearnes </PERSON>, a 61-year-old state representative whose husband <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> was governor from 1965 to 1973, is hoping to unseat Republican Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashcroft </PERSON>. She has Democratic opposition only from <PERSON> Lavoy </PERSON> `` Zaki'' <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> area teacher. In <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, both <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Huber </PERSON> have sought to make <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>'s liberalism the issue, saying he's out of tune with voters. But the 50-year-old incumbent says he's happy to defend a voting record that brought him a 100 percent score in a recent survey by Americans for Democratic Action. <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s senior senator, has $ 4 million in campaign funds and faces no opposition in the Democratic primary as he seeks a third term. He also emphasizes that he's expected to become chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION>, Housing, and <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> if he is re-elected. <PERSON> Huber </PERSON>, 65, has portrayed himself as a staunch <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Republican, in favor of preserving federal income tax cuts, a strong defense, using more federal muscle in the war on drugs, and opposing abortion. <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, 44, holds more moderate views. During his term in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, 1981-82, he supported most of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s tax cut and budget reduction policies, but often opposed the administration on social issues and cuts in college aid. AIDS became an issue in the race last week when <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> said in a radio interview that he took `` a reasonable, rational, I think very responsible approach to the problems that face this nation. Mr. <PERSON> Huber </PERSON> has said that the reason people have AIDS is the wrath of God, punishment from God'' of homosexuals and drug users. <PERSON> Huber </PERSON>, asked about <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>'s remarks, said `` I do n't know whether it's the wrath of God, but if it is n't it should be.'' <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>'s dream of bringing a string of glittering hotel-casinos to an island in the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> is showing up on the ballot for the third time in 12 years. Opponents sponsored an intiative urging voters to go on record opposing the idea, which has been voted down both previous times. Young has been pushing casinos as a way to bring jobs and tourism to a city with a 9.6 percent unemployment rate, but he acknowledges the advisory vote is likely to fail. `` If we win, it will be the upset of all upsets,'' he said. Gambling can be legalized only with approval of the Legislature.

 The Iranian government replied officially to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> suggestion of working toward improved relations, but imposed unacceptable conditions for such a move, a <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said today. <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the message repeated demands the Iranians have publicly made, particularly the release of their assets held by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> financial institutions. `` I'd say that it did n't offer any new information,'' the spokesman told reporters at the daily <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> news briefing. `` We have received a response to our earlier message, and the thrust of it was that they said the same thing in private that they had been saying in public,'' the spokesman said. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said this included an insistence by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must release Iranian assets frozen in this country, to demonstrate <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s interest in warming relations with the revolutionary government of the <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said the Iranian message came in late Friday through a `` third party.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said `` there was nothing new in it beyond what has been said publicly.'' She decined to provide any details. `` I ` m not offering any further characterization of it. We simply said that we had sent a message. We had a response.'' Asked if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had replied to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, the spokeswoman said: `` No.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that the communication from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> contained a `` quid pro quo,'' adding that deal-making with <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> is `` something we have said we wo n't do.'' The spokesman had said repeatedly last week that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> received no response from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to a letter that the administration sent congratulating <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> on its acceptance of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> Resolution 598, seeking a ceasefire to the Iran-Iraq war and expressing an interest in an improvement of relations. He also said at the time that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would deal only with an `` authoritative'' representative of the ayatollah's government The spokesman refused today to identify the source of the communication, although he said that it had been accepted by the administration as official and genuine. `` We considered it a serious response,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` -LRB- But -RRB- I do n't think we're willing to give it any signficance.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials had privately confirmed two weeks ago that the main <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> feeler directed toward <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> had been sent through the auspices of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>. A delegation of high-ranking Iranian officials has been at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to discuss implementation of the ceasefire resolution. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> had said Sunday that he would be willing to meet with his Iranian counterpart if there were interest in such a session. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have steadfastly ruled out negotiating with the Iranians to gain the release of nine Americans held hostage by pro-Iranian elements in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Government Confirms Arrest of Dissidents</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> announced Monday it had detained 10 people, including the country's most outspoken dissident, to protect itself from attack. The announcement came less than a week after new leader <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, a hardline former general known for ruthless suppression of dissent, came to power. He replaced Ne Win who ruled <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> for 26 years. Official <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> radio, monitored in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, said action would be taken against prominent dissident <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON> and nine other detainees `` according to criminal law procedures.'' `` In order to prevent an attack against the state, as preventative measures, authorities concerned detained <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON> and his associates ... as from July 29, 1988,'' the broadcast said. It was the first official word of the arrests, which had been reported last week by Western diplomats in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s capital, and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> The radio did not mention the fate of <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> correspondent Sein Win and others the diplomats said also were detained. Those listed by the radio mostly were retired military officers, many of whom supported Ne Win during his early years in power. Most are in their mid - to late 60s <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON>, 70, emerged this year as the most outspoken critic of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s authoritarian regime through a series of letters decrying economic and political conditions in the country. He singled out new leader <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> for `` turning a blind eye'' to gross human rights abuses during bloody student riots in March in which more than 100 people are believed to have been killed. <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, chief of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION> and the country's president, is widely believed to have commanded the troops that suppressed the student riots. <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON>, giving gruesome details of rapes and beatings, claimed that 283 people died. A private businessman, <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON> was once allied with Ne Win and was regarded as his possible successor. But the two disagreed over economic policy and the more pragmatic, liberal <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON> resigned from the government in 1963. He was subsequently jailed. The state radio broadcast identified the other detainees as Kyi Han, <PERSON> Tun </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Ba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shwe </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Khin </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tun </PERSON> <PERSON> Shwe </PERSON>, <PERSON> Chit </PERSON> <PERSON> Ko </PERSON> <PERSON> Ko </PERSON>, <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON> and Zaw Win. Retired colonels <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> <PERSON> Muang </PERSON> and <PERSON> Khin </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyo </PERSON> were in Ne Win's <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> after he seized power in 1962 <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> left Ne Win's government in 1963 and <PERSON> Khin </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyo </PERSON> was fired in 1965. <PERSON> Han </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> has once served as military attache in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and as ambassador to <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. Ba Shwe is an ex-ambassador to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. Diplomatic sources said that <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Shwe </PERSON>, a former general who once served as ambassador to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, also was held. <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> was reported quiet Monday, but leaflets circulated by student groups called for a nationwide anti-government strike Aug. 8, Western diplomatic sources said. The sources, who asked not to be further identified, said some of the leaflets came from the <ORGANIZATION> All </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Universities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, which has demanded the removal of <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> and the release of student detainees. Virtually all the country's academic institutions were closed after the last student riots in June. They are scheduled to reopen in mid-August. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, meanwhile, reportedly made an official inquiry Monday into the status of <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> correspondent <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON>, who diplomats said was being held with the others at Insein prison on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON>, 66, once a publisher of the English-language newspaper The Guardian, was awarded the Golden Pen of Freedom by the Paris-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journalists </ORGANIZATION> in 1963 for his work in fostering a free press in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. He was jailed for three years in the 1960s along with thousands of other political prisoners.

 A prosecutor told jurors today the case involving a Lutheran minister and a free-lance journalist is not about the sanctuary movement or freedom of the press. Instead, said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rhonda </PERSON> <PERSON> Backinoff </PERSON>, it is a case involving the exploitation of two pregnant Salvadoran women who came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> seeking a better life. The issues of sanctuary or the First Amendment were only smokescreens raised by the defendants to protect themselves, she said. Ms. <PERSON> Backinoff </PERSON> outlined the prosection's evidence today as she presented her final arguments. Defense attorneys were to give closing statements later today. `` Why the defendants did what they did is really not an issue here,'' she said. `` The bottom line is the immigration law was avoided.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Conway </PERSON> on Friday denied defense motions to dismiss the case against the Rev. <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Remer-Thamert </PERSON>, 44, and <PERSON> Demetria </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, 28. Ms. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> faces one count of conspiracy to violate immigration laws and one count each of transporting and inducing <PERSON> Ines </PERSON> <PERSON> Campos-Anzora </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cecelia </PERSON> <PERSON> Elias-Alegria </PERSON> to enter the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Remer-Thamert faces one count of conspiracy and two counts each of transporting, harboring and inducing the women to enter the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Backinoff </PERSON> told the jurors that Remer-Thamert and Ms. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> conspired to bring the women into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> illegally in August 1986. She said <PERSON> Remer-Thamert </PERSON> bought the women's tickets to <LOCATION> Chihuahua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, by airplane and to <LOCATION> Ciudad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juarez </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, by train. She said both Remer-Thamert and Ms. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> met them in <LOCATION> Juarez </LOCATION> and both were present when <PERSON> Remer-Thamert </PERSON> arranged for the women to be taken illegally into <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Backinoff </PERSON> also said both defendants were present on the trip by car from <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Remer-Thamert </PERSON> has testified he believed former Gov. <PERSON> Toney </PERSON> <PERSON> Anaya </PERSON>'s proclamation declaring <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> a sanctuary state would allow him to bring the women into the country without visas. The prosecutor said Ms. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> never wrote about the case. Ms. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, who writes religion articles for the <ORGANIZATION> Albuquerque </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> and other publications, has said she was present as a reporter. She said she never wrote about the women because she began to fear that could jeopardize the safety of the women or of their families in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Backinoff </PERSON> said the women were used as props by the defendants to support their own beliefs about <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. She also said the defendants never intended for the women to remain in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. She said a contract between the women and a <LOCATION> Salvadoran </LOCATION> attorney called for them to give up their children for adoption and return to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>South Korea Proposes Contacts With North to Ease Tension</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> on Monday proposed preliminary contacts with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to set up a joint parliamentary session that would draft a non-aggression pact and other tension-easing measures. National Assembly speaker <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Chae-sun </PERSON> said in a letter addressed to his North Korean counterpart, <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyung-sup </PERSON>, that the working talks be held next week in <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION>, a border village about 35 miles north of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Also on Monday, radical students tried unsuccessfully to deliver another letter to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> as part of their plan to march to the border Aug. 15 for separate talks with northern students on national unification. In his letter, sent to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> through <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> said: `` We hope you will respond affirmatively to our proposal for holding representatives' talks as soon as possible.'' <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has not responded. The South Korean letter came after two <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> proposals last month calling for a joint session of the two countries' legislatures to draft a non-aggression pact and to discuss <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s possible participation in the Sept. 17-Oct. 2 Olympic Games in In a letter delivered July 21, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> proposed that the parliaments hold the joint session by the end of this month. In a second letter, sent five days later, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> said the joint session should also discuss <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>'s bid to be a co-host of the Olympics. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> suggested that both sides skip the working sessions and convene a full parliamentary session in the capital of <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>, but <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> officials said preliminary talks are needed to set an agenda and discuss other details. South Korean officials said <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s demand to be a co-host of the Olympics could be a stumbling block, but said they want to open contact. Officials in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, who have expressed concern that <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> might resort to terrorism to disrupt the Olympics, said privately that resumption of contacts between the two sides would help ensure the safety of the Olympics. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has said it would boycott the Olympics unless it is allowed to be a co-host. The International Olympic Committee has rejected the North Korean demand, saying the Olympics are awarded to one city and can not be shared. An unknown number of students left <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> on Monday for <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> to deliver a letter to their North Korean counterparts concerning the proposed Aug. 15 talks. A spokesman for the group said in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> the students were determined to deliver the letter in the village, which is off-limits to civilians. Authorities deployed about 2,000 police around bus and train stations on the <LOCATION> Seoul-Panmunjom </LOCATION> route and checked travelers going to the border area. No arrests were made. An attempt by students to march to the border June 10 also was blocked by police. Communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> have remained bitter rivals since the country was partitioned by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> at the end of World War II. The division was followed by the Korean War of 1950-53.

 The decision by King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> to cut ties with the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> has alarmed Palestinians and damaged the election hopes of Israeli Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>. The Jordanian monarch made it clear he was giving up his claim to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, which his grandfather King <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> annexed in 1950 and which he lost to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. In deference to <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> demands, he said, <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> would dissolve `` legal and administrative links'' to Palestinians in the occupied territories. That remark prompted widespread concern among Palestinians, much of it voiced privately, about how far <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> will go in breaking his ties with Palestinians in the occupied territories. Jordanian influence is pervasive. Jordanian dinars are the main currency in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> law is used in the courts, and Jordanian textbooks are used in the schools. More importantly, nearly 1 million Palestinians from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> carry Jordanian passports and the king distributes about $ 70 million to $ 100 million a year in salaries, scholarships and stipends. Diplomatic observers believe <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> will be cautious in carrying out such steps so as not to stir unrest among Palestinians who account for about two-thirds of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s 2.4 million population. But many Palestinians fear <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> may limit the validity of passports or refuse to issue new ones. He also has the power to restrict visits across the <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> bridges. <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> can delay, reduce or cancel altogether stipends paid to 13,000 teachers, lawyers, ex-Jordanian government workers and officials of Islamic institutions. The expectation was that <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> would gradually introduce new measures defining <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s new relationship with Palestinians in the occupied territories. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> supporters warned the change would be dramatic. `` Nobody appreciates the magnitude of what is happening,'' said <PERSON> Othman </PERSON> <PERSON> Hallak </PERSON>, editor of the pro-Jordan Arabic daily <ORGANIZATION> An </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nahar </ORGANIZATION> newspaper in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. He said there were serious questions about whether <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would allow the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to take over <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s behind-the-scenes role in supporting agriculture, education and Moslem charities. It was even more doubtful whether <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was willing to engage in any form of dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> is viewed by both major <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> political blocs as an unacceptable partner for negotiations because of his reliance on terrorism and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s commitment to destroying the Jewish state <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, the head of the left-of-center <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, invested a great deal of credibility in promoting <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> as a stand-in negotiator for the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s spurning of a leading role was therefore a serious embarrassment for <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, who already is trailing right-wing Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> in polls conducted in advance of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s Nov. 1 election <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> had dueled repeatedly with <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> in public over the need for an international conference on <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said such a conference would give <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> a cover to talk directly to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> about the future of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, something the monarch could not do otherwise. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said he worked out a framework for negotiations with <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> at an April 11, 1987, meeting in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. He said the monarch agreed that Palestinians negotiators in a joint delegation with <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> would not be affiliated with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. Israeli officials, especially those close to <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, have sought to play down the importance of <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s measures. They argued that the moves were tactical and <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> was waiting to be called on for help if the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> was unable to meet the challenge. `` It is a signal to the -LRB- Palestinian -RRB- inhabitants of the territories not to forget who they depend on,'' said <PERSON> Ephraim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sneh </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> military governor who belongs to the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. He predicted <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> would resume a more active role after the Israeli and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> elections in November. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials also stressed there has been little tangible impact from the two concrete steps <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> has taken: dissolving parliament or halting a five-year development program that came nowhere near raising a promised $ 1.3 billion. But the 60-member lower house of parliament, which included 30 West Bankers, and the development scheme were symbols, started when <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> wanted to signal his desire to broaden <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>'s influence and take an active role in peace negotiations. In his televised speech Sunday night, <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> said he would continue to play a role in peace efforts but made it clear that his position would be more in tune with the policies of other <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. To underscore commitment to <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> unity for West Bankers who are able to view <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> television, <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> sat in front of a large portrait of Emir <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Bin </PERSON> <PERSON> Aly </PERSON>, his great-grandfather and the first modern leader to mobilize pan-Arab forces for a 1916 revolt against Ottoman <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> will play a role as an <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> country and a confrontation state, but the role of representing the Palestinians falls to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Siniora </PERSON>, editor of the pro-PLO daily <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Fajr </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Launch Team Completes Shuttle Countdown Despite Leak</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> detected a new liquid hydrogen leak Monday as it put space shuttle Discovery through a fullscale countdown rehearsal, and officials said the problem could further delay a crucial engine test firing beyond Thursday. Had the leak been found during an actual count, the launch would have been scrubbed. But because it was a test, the launch director bypassed the problem to gather as much data and experience as possible from the first such rehearsal since the Challenger disaster 2 -LCB- years ago. `` The launch team did a superb job on the wet countdown demonstration test and accomplished most of the objectives,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Crippen </PERSON>, deputy director of shuttle operations. Objectives missed during the `` wet'' test, in which the liquid propellants were pumped to the shuttle's tanks, will be sought during a second countdown leading to the 20-second firing of Discovery's three main engines on the launch pad. Launch director <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Sieck </PERSON> said a firm schedule for the test-firing would not be set until at least Tuesday, after technicians have had a chance to trace the source of the latest leak, in a launch pad service mast. The firing already has been delayed four times by various problems, including another hydrogen leak in the same service mast last Friday. The test is considered mandatory before Discovery is certified ready for the first shuttle flight since the loss of Challenger and its crew of seven in an explosion shortly after liftoff on Jan. 28, 1986. Officials believe the practice countdown delays, combined with an unresolved leak in the spaceship's steering thruster system, could push the launch date back from mid-September into October. The new leak halted fueling of the shuttle's liquid hydrogen tank early Monday after it had been loaded with 254,000 gallons, 67 percent of capacity. Launch director <PERSON> Sieck </PERSON> assessed the situation and ordered the clock to continue to obtain data on other aspects of the count. A full load of 143,000 gallons was pumped into the liquid oxygen tank. The clock was stopped as planned by a simulated problem at 11 seconds before a mock liftoff, and the launch team practiced steps it would take to recover from a postponement _ making the shuttle safe, draining the propellants and getting the vehicle ready for another countdown and launch attempt. The second countdown is to end with the engine test firing, with Discovery bolted to the pad. The purpose of the dual countdown test is to check modifications made to the engines and launch pad since the Challenger accident and to give the launch team practice. When the firing is completed, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> still must cope with the small gas leak in a steering engine system that is separate from Discovery's main engines. Engineers have a plan to reach the leak by cutting a hole through the rear bulkhead of the shuttle's cargo bay. Another option, with a decision to be made after the test-firing, is to take Discovery off the pad and back to a hangar for repair, a move that could postpone the launch until November.

 Syndicated columnist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>, calling himself a pawn in a larger gun-control debate, pleaded innocent Monday to charges he used an unregistered weapon to shoot a teen-ager who took an uninvited dip in his backyard pool. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> has been charged with one count each of possessing an unregistered weapon, and possessing ammunition for the gun, in connection with the June 14 shooting. Both are misdemeanors. District of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hearing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commissioner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kaye </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> scheduled trial for Sept. 22, and released <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> on his own recognizance. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> requested a jury trial. If he is convicted on both charges, the columnist could face a maximum penalty of two years in prison and a $ 2,000 fine. The district's 1976 handgun ordinance essentially bans posession of handguns and ammunition not owned at the time the law was passed, except for law officers. After his court appearance, <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> lashed out at those who say he is hypocritical for using a handgun. `` I am aware that I am the pawn in a brutal game between those who favor and those who oppose handgun control,'' <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> said, reading a prepared statement to dozens of reporters and television camera crews. `` I want to make it clear that I still favor a strict national law to control the availability of handguns. `` There is no hypocrisy in advocating a national policy that no one seems to be able to get through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. The columnist also asserted that he has received additional death threats since the shooting incident. He had previously told police that he obtained the weapon used in the shooting after receiving similar threats in 1982. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> has said that the gun and ammunition were originally owned by his son, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who was told that he did not need to register them because he was serving as an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent at the time. Outside the courthouse, a half-dozen handgun advocates rallied in support of the columnist's right to bear arms. `` We think that <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> may be guilty of raving hypocrisy, but he should n't be charged in a court of law today for protecting his home with a gun,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellinger </PERSON>, the leader of Action for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, a conservative activist group that champions the right to private handgun ownership. `` We welcome him into the family of people protecting their home with guns.'' Other supporters carried posters reading, `` Warning: This home protected by <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>,'' coupled with a Rambo-like drawing of <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>'s head atop a muscle-bound, gun-toting torso. Still others displayed signs reading, `` Leave <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> alone.'' `` It -LRB- the Rowan shooting -RRB- shows what can happen in a moment of panic,'' said <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, wife of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s press secretary She was not at the rally, but said in a telephone interview, `` With the handgun, in most cases you see more cases of misuse than you do anything else.'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> became president of <ORGANIZATION> Handgun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>, an anti-handgun group, after her husband suffered permanent brain damage when he was wounded during <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>'s attempt to assassinate <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1981. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>, 62, was cleared last month of assault charges in the shooting incident after an investigation by federal prosecutors. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> said at the time that he thought <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> should be prosecuted on the weapons charges, but deferred that decision to <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> officials, who normally decide whether to prosecute such cases. The shooting occurred, <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> said, when he heard noises in his backyard, called police, and discovered <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 18, of suburban <LOCATION> Chevy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chase </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, and three other youths by his pool. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> shot <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> in the wrist when, he said, the youth lunged at him. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and a companion <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Bachman </PERSON>, 19, were charged with unlawful entry, but prosecutors dropped the misdemeanor charges in exchange for 40 hours of community service work.

 If, as <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> said, everyone will be famous for 15 minutes, they'll be able to time their moments in the sun with a Warhol-designed watch, record the event in a Warhol-decorated diary and wear clothes inspired by the late pop artist. A line of Warhol products ranging from business planning calendars to watches costing several thousand dollars should appear in retail stores early next year, said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlaifer </PERSON>, president of Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> Schlaifer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the marketing rights to <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> and his work. <PERSON> Schlaifer </PERSON>, whose company until earlier this year marketed Cabbage Patch Kids dolls, said the Warhol products are still being developed. But he said they would include clothing, bedding, jewelry and paper products, such as calendars, posters and diaries. `` We're targeting a young, thinking audience where the Warhol attitude and image is reflected,'' <PERSON> Schlaifer </PERSON> said. Some of the items will bear <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON>'s likeness or that of his work, while others will aim to capture the spirit of the artist, <PERSON> Schlaifer </PERSON> said. Moderately priced items will be sold in `` better department and specialty stores,'' <PERSON> Schlaifer </PERSON> said, while the expensive products will be availble only through more exclusive outlets. <PERSON> Schlaifer </PERSON>, who commissioned <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> to do a series of portraits of the Cabbage Patch Kids, said he proposed to the artist a massive marketing effort in 1985 and made a formal presentation a year later. The talks slowed down but were revived only a week before <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> died on Feb. 22, 1987, at the age of 58, <PERSON> Schlaifer </PERSON> said. The deal giving <PERSON> Schlaifer </PERSON> the marketing rights was finalized later with the <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> estate, he said. <PERSON> Schlaifer </PERSON> said <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON>, a former ad man who well known for his silver-wigged celebrity status as well as for his works of art, was enthusiastic about the idea. `` With his sense of commerce, and what we outlined in terms of exposure, he was very excited,'' <PERSON> Schlaifer </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> was unique in how he designed himself. In a way, he made himself as unique as his art.'' Despite <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON>'s flair for publicity and his unconventional approach to art, <PERSON> Schlaifer </PERSON> acknowledged there may be criticism of such blatant commercial use of the artist's work. But he defended his plans, saying <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> was not averse to commercialism and noting that even the most respected museums have gift shops. `` Virtually anything anyone does is subject to criticism,'' he said. `` The question is, is it appropriate? <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> had a strong commercial instinct. `` All museums have huge product enterprises that help support the museum and educate the public. I'm not sure where that criticism has validity, other than the position that art should only be in the museums or in books.'' <PERSON> Schlaifer </PERSON> said <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> did not limit himself to creating museum pieces. <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> also made movies, started `` Interview'' magazine and designed album covers for a number of rock and roll bands. `` He was commercial in a non-commercial way _ that was the inherent irony in everything <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> did,'' <PERSON> Schlaifer </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Schlaifer </PERSON> is banking on continuing fascination with <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> and his work. `` There's sort of an automatic excitement with anything connected with the <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> name,'' he said. He noted that an auction earlier this year of artwork and other items owned by <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> drew crowds and large sums of money, and said displays of <PERSON> Warhol </PERSON> art, particularly a traveling exhibit planned next year by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Museum of Modern Art, should heighten interest. `` If anything, the acceptance is higher now than when we originally proposed this,'' <PERSON> Schlaifer </PERSON> said. `` He's a major artist by any definition. He gets more press dead than most celebrities do alive.''

<HEAD>Carlucci Tells Kremlin Brass He Doubts Adoption of Defensive
Doctrine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Defense Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> told 200 top Soviet officers Monday he has seen no evidence for the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION>'s claim that it has adopted a defensive military strategy At the start of a four-day visit expected to offer a glimpse of secret Soviet equipment and bases, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> spent two hours with Defense Minister <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> and addressed senior officers at the General Staff's <ORGANIZATION> Voroshilov </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>. About 1,800 miles away in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, four missiles were blown apart to begin the Soviet program of destroying more than 1,700 weapons under the superpower treaty banning intermediate-range nuclear rockets, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> called the destruction of the missiles a `` great event.'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the short-range missiles, known in the west as SS-12s, were destroyed in the presence of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inspectors at the <LOCATION> Saryozek </LOCATION> test range in <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>. At the end of the day, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> told reporters his talks with <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> `` went very well.'' He praised the academy staff for showing him the classrooms and laboratories where Soviet military strategy is developed. The tone of his speech to the officers was one of doubt about the extent to which the Soviet military machine has been redirected toward defense. Marshal <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON>, the Soviet chief of staff, and other senior officers say Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is switching to defense as a military doctrine from the traditional predominance of offensive weapons. `` We have difficulty in reconciling a defensive doctrine with what we see in Soviet force structure and operational strategy as an emphasis on the offensive,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said in his speech. `` We see no shift of emphasis to the kind of forces traditionally associated with defense.'' `` We also have difficulty reconciling the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION>'s pledge not to be the first to use nuclear weapons with your continuing emphasis on heavy ICBMs, such as the SS-18,'' he said. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> described the Soviet armory as `` a capability more compatible with a military doctrine that emphasizes pre-emptive nuclear strikes.'' He criticized the Soviet government for not making military spending public and said Western analysts estimate 15 percent to 17 percent of the nation's wealth goes to defense. The current <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military budget is 5.9 percent of the gross national product. `` No one begrudges you the need for a strong and capable army,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said. `` What troubles us is when the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION> continues to develop forces far in excess of what it needs for purposes of its own defense.'' He said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space-based defense project, formally named the Strategic Defense Initiative and popularly called `` Star Wars,'' is a step toward greater stability that `` does not represent the slightest threat to the U.S.S.R.'' In a 20-minute question-and-answer session after the speech, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> defended the size of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s doctrine of deterrence through adequate armed forces and weaponry To reporters, he expressed pleasure that his schedule would include access to Soviet defense installations and equipment, such as the secret Blackjack bomber and the <LOCATION> Sevastopol </LOCATION> naval base on the <LOCATION> Crimean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>. `` It's a unique experience for a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense secretary,'' he said on arrival in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people through me can see what the Soviet military is doing and can learn about their attitudes and doctrine.'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said he believed he and <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> could be more candid with each other than other high-level officials because `` we are soldiers.'' They first met in <LOCATION> Bern </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, in March and renewed the acquaintance during the Reagan-Gorbachev summit at the end of May. Both have called their active schedule of meetings as an opportunity to ease tensions and solve problems. Among those traveling with <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> are <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON>, assistant secretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION>, and representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The Americans will see the Taman army base and <LOCATION> Kubinka </LOCATION> air field, both near <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, on Tuesday. They are to visit the <LOCATION> Crimea </LOCATION> on Wednesday and leave for <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> the next day after touring a ship of the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> fleet at <LOCATION> Sevastopol </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Woods Says South Africans Bungled Handling of `Cry Freedom'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BRADLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> badly bungled its handling of the movie `` Cry Freedom'' turning it into a propaganda victory for those fighting apartheid, according to <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>, one of the subjects of the film. <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>, a white South African journalist forced to flee the country in 1978, also said on Monday that he suspected right-wingers close to the government planted three bombs in cinemas to disrupt screenings Friday. `` There are people on the fringes of the security police who can be relied upon to do this sort of thing if they get the nod,'' <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in an interview. No one was hurt in the three bombings and many white South Africans saw the film before the government seized all copies, several hours after it began showing at 30 cinemas. Here for a <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers' meeting on countering South African censorship and propaganda, <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> said he never expected `` Cry Freedom'' to be shown in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The movie tells the story of his friendship with black activist <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Biko </PERSON>, who died in police custody in 1977. `` The fact it was shown even for two showings was a bungle. They had been counting on the censorship people reversing their decision. When that failed, they were counting on the cinema managers to chicken out. When they refused, the government decided to send in the police,'' said <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>. `` I'm surprised at the ineptitude. `` South Africans are normally unaware of the extent to which their media are censored. But when there's all kinds of controversy about a film and they see the government crudely taking the films away, that's the most blatant form of censorship and even non-politicized people might be politicized by that.'' He said South Africans who have seen the movie were staggered. `` It's the truth of it that hits them _ to actually see things they've known in their gut were going on,'' <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> said. He hoped the eight <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> ministers, who meet Tuesday and Wednesday under the chairmanship of Canadian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, would decide to finance an underground press in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and set up a radio service outside the country to disseminate uncensored news. <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> said unsigned news reports could be carried out by couriers to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and distributed, provided they are monitored by credible experts. Asked if he had been asked to play such a role, <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>, 54, said: `` I'd rather not say at this stage.'' He will moderate a public forum on South African propaganda on Tuesday. Calling on <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> to take the political lead, <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> said he wants Western nations to sever diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> but to maintain indirect links through the black front-line states, such as <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION>. `` There's a myth that white South Africans only get tougher if you lean on them,'' <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> said. `` If every South African traveler abroad had to go to <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>, that would concentrate their minds.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> summit in <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION> in October asked the foreign ministers' panel to review the fight against apartheid. The ministers are from <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guyana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> declined, because Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> opposes tougher sanctions against <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> can not indefinitely defy <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> and post-election <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pressure. `` She'll end up U-turning just as she did in 1978 over <LOCATION> Rhodesia </LOCATION> becoming <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> has organized an arts festival, a City Hall exhibition of photos and posters banned in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, and a lakefront candle-lighting ceremony in conjunction with the meeting. <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> residents were asked to show their opposition to apartheid by lighting candles in their windows.

I believe that people should talk,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who lost <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Democratic primary in April and subsequently lost the nomination <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> Borough President <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporter and now co-chair of the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> state </LOCATION>, said the meeting would be `` sometime in August'' but is `` not likely to be this week.'' <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> said the meeting would involve himself, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, a black labor leader in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. He said it likely would take place in <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> office. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> criticized <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> during the primary race, saying Jews would be `` crazy'' to vote for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who supports Palestinian self-determination. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> called him at his <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> home early Monday `` and said he would like to meet.'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> later issued a statement saying, `` I agree that in the interest of party unity and the election of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, it would be good to meet with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>.'' `` The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is built on the premise that people with different ideologies can come together under one tent. That's what gets us elected.'' But <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> added, `` I do n't in any way recant my policy differences with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. They are there ... I hope to work in support of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and then we'll continue the ideological battle at another time.'' `` My feelings toward the mayor are always open and respectful,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>. `` His toward me were very hostile.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> `` used race and religion as a litmus test and divided the city and helped to lower the moral tone of the campaign.'' Both <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON> have been mentioned as possible opponents to <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> in his re-election bid next year. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said he was not trying to use <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to gain support among blacks for his own mayoral campaign. `` I'm not in contention this year,'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said. `` And if you really believe as I do that it's important to have a Democrat in the White House, you set aside those differences.'' While <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> said he welcomed the meeting, he questioned its impact on the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign. `` The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign and the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> camp have come together pretty well in forging an integrated policy and campaign staff'' in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state, <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> said. The New York-based <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said it hoped the meeting would help heal the rift between blacks and Jews. `` We are in favor of anything which would dampen tensions and heighten communications between the two communities,'' said <ORGANIZATION> AJC </ORGANIZATION> Program Director <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>. The meeting `` will make a step toward doing that and the degree to which it would reduce tension, we would welcome it,'' he said. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, who helped arrange the meeting, said `` I think it is a commendable thing for <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who feels insulted and who was insulted by what was said, to say, ` OK, you insulted me. You hurt me. But in the interests of a truth greater than me or you, I will sit down with you. Because we have urgent problems. ... Because <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> are the only ones committed to dealing with those urgent problems.'''

</TEXT>
<HEAD>REPORT FROM THE VISIT TO IRAN:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 We deeply regret to say that, on the basis of evidence gathered during the present mission, and in spite of repeated appeals by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, chemical weapons continue to be used on an intensive scale against Iranian forces. As highlighted ... by previous missions to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, the continued use of such weapons in the present conflict increases the risk of their use in future conflicts. It is also clear from accumulated evidence that the use of chemical weapons in the present conflict has been intensifying and has also become more frequent. If such trends continue, it may have even more serious consequences than those that have already been experienced. The use yperite -LRB- mustard gas -RRB- was again confirmed, both medically and by chemical analysis ... The use of nerve gas or cyanide was not confirmed by chemical analysis in the field, no doubt owing to their rapid disappearance ... According to patients as well as reports of doctors ... 2,000 people had been affected on the Majnoon Islands ... The chief of the medical service of the region further said that, on June 25 ... there had been a massive attack by Iraqi forces which had begun with artillery fire using chemical ammunition and lasted for approximately two hours. Later, airplanes and helicopters had joined the attack. According to the same source, the frontline had been attacked with cyanide and organophospherous compounds. Logistic units, command posts and reserves had also been attacked but with mustard gas. Four emergency medical centers and one hospital in the zone had been attacked with chemical weapons, although there had not been victims, owing to protective measures ... The typical casualty could be described as a male soldier, 18 to 48 years of age, mostly in his 20s, the average being 24, who suffered the effects of chemical agents contained in artillery shells or in bombs which exploded on the ground between 4 and 200 -LRB- yards -RRB- away. Seventy-seven percent used a gas mask ... It has been possible to determine without any doubt that, in the course of June 1988, Iranian soldiers were affected by yperite -LRB- mustard gas -RRB-. The 36 cases which were examined displayed typical symptoms ... including lesions of erythema, darkening of the skin, blisters, like second-degree burns, and respiratory lesions in a few instances. From the examination of weapon fragments it can be concluded that bombs similar in 1984, 1986 and 1987 have again been used against Iranian forces on Iranian territory, indicating their repeated utilization by Iraqi forces.

<HEAD>REPORT FROM THE VISIT TO IRAQ:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The presence of yperite -LRB- mustard gas -RRB- was again confirmed both medically and by chemical analysis. However, it is clear that the evidence resulting from this and previous missions points to an ever-increasing presence of different types of weapons associated with aggressive chemical agents in the <LOCATION> Iran-Iraq </LOCATION> conflict, which has been leading unavoidably to the repeated use of chemical weapons in violation of the Geneva Protocol of 1925 ... The patients examined suffered, according to their statements ... the effects of chemical agents in a few mortar grenades launched against them during two separate attacks with conventional mortar munition at two locations near the front ... On July 11, the team visited the camp outside <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. After donning protective equipment supplied by the military authorities, as some grenades in the stockpile were leaking and were in bad condition, we went into a bunker containing 81mm mortar grenades. The number of grenades was stated to be 141, and they were claimed to be chemical munition captured from Iranian forces in <LOCATION> Salamcha </LOCATION>, east of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> ... Unopened grenades still in wooden crates were tested ... A positive response was obtained, suggestive of the presence of a blister agent ... By visual examination, the alleged chemical grenades were compared with a conventional high explosive grenade shown to us and were found to be identical ... It has been possible to determine without any doubt that, between the end of June and the beginning of July, nine <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> soldiers were affected by yperite -LRB- mustard gas -RRB-, four of them in a military position named `` Peak 660'' near As <LOCATION> Sulaymaniyah </LOCATION>, and the other five in the military sector of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION>. All of them had at least one of the following types of injury typical to exposure to yperite: erythema, darkening of the skin, conjunctivitis, blisters and injuries common to those found in second-degree burns.

 <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> was cleared Monday of any connection with fingerprints found at the scene of a year-old burglary at an elementary school in which $ 4,000 in donations for her late son's liver transplant were stolen. The still unsolved theft generated an avalanche of publicity and prompted President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and others to donate a total of $ 689,000 for her son's three unsuccessful operations. After her son's death, Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> was accused of misusing the funds. <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> police said last week they had received unspecified information linking Mrs. DeSillers to the break-in, and issued a search warrant for her fingerprints. She submitted to fingerprinting under protest Monday, and <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> police quickly cleared her of any connection with a print left in the school closet where the money was held, said police spokesman <PERSON> Ott </PERSON> <PERSON> Cefkin </PERSON>. `` She is not a suspect and we have no physical evidence linking her to the burglary,'' <PERSON> Cefkin </PERSON> said. `` But we would have been remiss if we had not pursued it.'' He refused to reveal what information led to the demand for fingerprints, and said the investigation was continuing. Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> was not at home, but her attorney <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said he spoke to her after the police announcement. `` She was mad,'' said <PERSON> Black </PERSON>. `` She feels that she's been humiliated and held up to scorn once again. There's a lot of people out there now who think she stole that money.'' Earlier Monday, a <ORGANIZATION> Dade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge refused Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON>' request to block the police search warrant seeking her fingerprints. `` We found enough probable cause to have a judge approve a warrant,'' Assistant Dade State Attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shiffrin </PERSON> said after the hearing. `` There's probable cause to suspect her in criminal activity.'' The burglary at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anthon </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> school in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> prompted people across the country to donate money for the operations on her son, <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON>. Among the $ 689,000 raised for the boy was a $ 1,000 donation from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> and a $ 200,000 gift from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> millionaire <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> police said a thief broke into a closet at the accounting office of the school and took the money, which was raised by <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON>'s classmates through bake sales, flower sales and other fund-raisers. Most of the money was in change and small bills. <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> died in April 1987 while awaiting a fourth liver transplant at <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>'s Children's Hospital. Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> has refused to pay $ 262,000 in medical bills to <LOCATION> Children </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, saying her son received improper care. A court-appointed caretaker of the donated funds said Ms. DeSillers improperly used $ 200,000 of the money on luxury items ranging from jewelry to a BMW sports car. On Thursday, a <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> circuit judge ruled that she is not entitled to the remaining $ 240,000 of the donated money and that it should instead pay medical bills, debts and help other needy ill children.

 Defrocked preacher <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> visited the birthplace of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> on Monday, and said the Palestinian uprising was the work of the devil. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, who also toured a Jewish settlement, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> nothing could destroy <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> because the prophets predicted its establishment. `` The prophets ... foretold of the nation of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> once becoming a state and the people coming back to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, where he videotaped two 20-minute TV programs. `` God's arch enemy, Satan, does not want these prophecies to be fulfilled and will do everything he can to end it and to cause difficulties. `` That's how the political unrest enters in it today,'' he said, referring to the nearly eight-month uprising in the occupied lands. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> and his entourage then proceeded to <LOCATION> Tekoa </LOCATION>, a Jewish settlement about nine miles south of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, and got a taste of the uprising when their black Mercedes limousine drove around a burning tire that blocked the road. Jewish settler <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> received <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Frances </PERSON>, on a vine-covered patio typical of the flourishing lush settlement. Quoting from the Old Testament's Book of <LOCATION> Amos </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> told <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> the Jewish settlers were reviving a land that had laid barren and empty for thousands of years. `` Do you think this is a fulfillment of the prophecy?'' <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> asked. `` I believe that,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` The work we're doing is God's work <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, who brought 350 followers to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> at a time when many tourists are shunning the country, has been welcomed with open arms. But a columnist in the <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Davar </ORGANIZATION> newspaper warned Monday that <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s support of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was a double-edged sword. According to <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s theory, the state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is merely a vehicle to the coming of the Second Kingdom, when all Jews will have to convert to <ORGANIZATION> Christianity </ORGANIZATION>, wrote columnist <PERSON> Yoram </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>. `` No, <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> does not love us,'' <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> wrote. `` Certainly not love for its own sake.'' <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>, who runs a television ministry that reaches 2 million viewers from its base in <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, stepped down from the pulpit in February after admitting he sinned against his wife. A prostitute said he paid her to strip and perform lewd acts for him during visits to a motel. The <LOCATION> Lousiana </LOCATION> Assemblies of God denomination revoked his ministry credentials after he returned to the pulpit against their wishes in May. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> has refused to discuss the scandal except to say that he has put it behind him.

<TEXT>
 Thousands of Poles marking the 44th anniversary of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> uprising against the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> demanded Monday that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> end its silence over alleged atrocities against Poles during World War II. Speakers also called for less interference from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and demanded the right to hold free elections. `` <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has to realize that we fought on all fronts of the war, but we still have not regained our freedom,'' said <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziembinski </PERSON>, an independent opposition activist. Crowds filled <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Powazki </LOCATION> military cemetery to pay homage to those who fell during the 63-day revolt against Nazi occupation. The Nazis crushed the uprising. More than 245,000 people were killed and 85 percent of the city was destroyed. While scores of Poles lighted candles and laid flowers on the graves of friends and family members, hundreds of others gathered around a granite monument to Polish officers murdered in the <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> forest near the Soviet city of <LOCATION> Smolensk </LOCATION>. The massacre remains one of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s most bitter wartime memories and a sore spot in its relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The Soviets have never acknowledged responsibility for the incident, in which 4,300 Polish military officers were shot to death and left in a mass grave. Western historical sources indicate the Poles were murdered on the orders of Soviet dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> in the spring of 1940. But official Soviet and Polish histories claim that the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> killed them in 1941. A banner draped across the monument Monday read: `` Give us truth, <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> 1940.'' Later, a group of youths raised a banner which read: `` Solidarity will prove the truth about <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION>.'' Last year an official commission was established by the Polish and Soviet governments to investigate the incident. To the disappointment of many Poles, Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> did not mention <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> during a speech to the Polish parliament in July. However, he did make a general pledge to continue to pursue the elimination of gaps in official histories. Although the <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> memorial was the emotional focus of Monday's tribute, the gathering quickly turned political in tone `` We want the renewal of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, but not for communism,'' said <PERSON> Seweryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaworski </PERSON>, an activist of the outlawed Solidarity trade union, in a reference to the government's reform plans. While none of the Solidarity leadership was visible at the <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> monument, the crowd repeatedly flashed the union's two-fingered V-sign.

<HEAD>Ranks Restored In Chinese Army</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on Monday brought back military ranks to its army in a move to modernize its fighting force and boost morale after years of personnel cuts and tight budgets. The move came on the 61st anniversary of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and 23 years after <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON> banned ranks as inappropriate to his classless peasant army. On Oct. 1, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s national day, soldiers are to don new uniforms with insignia designating their military positions. The government also issued regulations spelling out awards to be given to servicemen and their families `` so as to encourage their dedicated spirit in defending and building the motherland.'' The new regulations guarantee servicemen that they will not lose their farmland when they are conscripted, as well offer pensions to those disabled in combat and pay damages to the families of those who died in combat. On Saturday, <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> and other senior leaders gathered at the Great Hall of the People to bestow medals on more than 80,000 veterans. Western military analysts in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the ranking system was designed to raise the morale of the army, after troop strength and state funding were slashed in the past decade and many military factories were converted to civilian use. The analysts said a need for reinstating ranks became evident after the Chinese army's embarrassing showing in a brief 1979 border war with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. `` These kinds of units need a strict command structure, with a clear delineation as to who is giving and who is receiving the orders,'' said a diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` Before today they did n't have that.'' The analysts said Monday's move is also aimed at ridding the army of leftist influences. In 1965, <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> abolished military ranks as part of his attempt to create a radically egalitarian society, in which a massive peasant army would would be called on to fight a `` people's war.'' <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, who rose to power in 1978, has rejected <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s concept and has tried to create a professional army Today, 70 percent of military commanders have college educations, compared to 1.6 percent in 1982. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, who controls the military as head of the central military commission, has reduced the size of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s armed forces to 3 million, from 4 million in 1985, and has introduced modern technology. He has also shaved the military's share of the government budget from 17.5 percent in 1978 to less than 10 percent. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> has also supported the transfer of `` cadres,'' or officers, to civilian duty as part of an effort to cut the oversized corps, many of whom were either aging or poorly trained. Among the 1 million soldiers demobilized in the past few years, 450,000 were cadres. The government announced that an additional 100,000 officers would be transferred to a civilian staff of educators and specialists.

<HEAD>Atlanta Newspapers Restore Use Of Courtesy Titles For Men</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Constitution, bucking recent trends in newspaper style, have restored the use of courtesy titles for men and women in their news columns. `` Under the new rules, the first reference to individuals will include full proper names along with the use of public, military, professional and ecclesiastical titles,'' the newspapers said in a front-page note announcing the policy in their combined editions Sunday. `` On second reference, names will be preceded by the earned title or the courtesy title for all individuals and not just for women, as is now the case.'' For example, when the newspaper writes about the city's top elected official, it will be Mayor <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> on first reference and Mayor Young on subsequent references. Or, in stories about one of the city's top businessmen, it will be <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, followed by Mr. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>. The decision is in contrast to many newspapers which have moved closer to dropping courtesy titles such as Mr., Mrs., Miss or Ms. Only a few newspapers, notably The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and The Wall Street Journal, use the courtesy title `` Mr.'' `` For some time we have been troubled by the limited use of courtesy titles in our news columns,'' Editor <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Kovach </PERSON> said in the front-page note. `` We hope the sense of dignity and respect that the consistent use of courtesy titles implies will more adequately reflect the relationship we believe exists between us and our readers,'' said <PERSON> Kovach </PERSON>, who came to the newspapers from <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> bureau The newspapers left unchanged their policy for sports stories, which do not include courtesy titles for men or women.

<TEXT>
 Drought-stricken farmers may get some federal aid by the October harvest, but only if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passes a relief bill in the next two weeks and gets it past President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said Monday. Separate versions of the bill, which will cost between $ 4 billion and $ 6 billion to implement, have passed in both houses of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, but <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> warned that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version contains some provisions he considers extravagant. `` I am hopeful they will be able to reconcile their differences and take out some of the more extravagant provisions that do not really apply to those farmers that have suffered in the drought,'' <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said at a news conference before addressing the annual meeting of the Soil and <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. If that reconciliation comes in the next two weeks, financial assistance could be on its way to farmers `` close to the first of October. I would hope that we could do it around the time that would coincide with the normal harvest,'' he said. <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said a joint conference committee is to meet Wednesday to discuss both versions of the bill. He said he considers amendments in the House version alloting assistance to farmers who produce their own feed for their livestock more feasible than the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version, which broadens aid to include livestock and poultry farmers who do not grow their own feed. <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said he would not disclose what his own recommendations to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will be, nor would he predict if the measure will be vetoed. <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> also said recent rain has helped the cornbelt, but not enough. `` The economic damage is very severe in the cornbelt, unlike anything we have ever seen,'' he said.

 Roadblocks to check drivers for signs of intoxication are ineffective and unconstitutional, the <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled Monday in upholding a lower court's ruling against the state. `` While the goals of the sobriety checkpoint program are laudable, the program fails to qualify as a reasonable seizure under the Fourth Amendment,'' the three-judge appeals panel wrote in a unanimous opinion. The state attorney general's office did not immediately have a comment about the ruling or any plans for further appeals. The <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1975 refused to rule on the constitutionality of systematic roadblock stops. Monday's ruling upholds the conclusions of <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Stacey </PERSON>, who issued a permanent injunction stopping the roadblocks on the grounds that they violated both the federal and state constitutions. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> chapter, praised <PERSON> Stacey </PERSON>'s 60-page opinion as `` the most extensive, definitive, best-reasoned analysis in the country of the alleged effectiveness of sobriety roadblocks and the extent to which they intrude upon the civil liberties of innocent motorists.'' `` I'm glad it was upheld,'' he said. `` Now the state should do what we suggested all the time, namely get down to the business of cracking down on drunken driving without violating the rights of innocent motorists.'' The program devised by state police followed a blueprint drafted from check lane laws in 37 other states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. Its prime model was <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>'s program, and the opinion noted the testimony of a <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant who said checkpoints there yielded few drunken driving arrests. Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>, who pushed through the program and made it one of his top priorities in 1986, would not comment until his staff had time to review the decision, spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said. The issue of anti-drunk checkpoints has come up in courts in about half of the states with mixed results, according to the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> appellate opinion. State courts in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> have upheld the roadblocks while they have been struck down in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has n't ruled on anti-drunk roadblocks but implied in a 1979 case that they are acceptable. The high court said police may not selectively stop drivers who are not suspected of breaking any law, but mentioned roadblocks among possible acceptable alternatives. In 1986, the high court refused to hear arguments in a case challenging <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s roadblocks. That decision had the effect of letting <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> continue the checkpoints.

 A teen-ager who claims he encountered a `` Lizard Man'' creature on the edge of a swamp is cashing in on the story. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, 17, is busy staffing the <ORGANIZATION> Lizard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Man </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bishopville </LOCATION>, a town of 3,400 about 45 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>.

Shepherding <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> through the attention is <PERSON> Joye </PERSON> <PERSON> Reis </PERSON>, from nearby <LOCATION> Sumter </LOCATION>, who says she's representing <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and taking 10 percent of everything he makes. `` I've always been interested in the unknown,'' she said.

Other entrepreneurs are cashing in on <LOCATION> Lizardmania </LOCATION> as well, selling T-shirts, bumper stickers and Lizard Man dolls. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> says he encountered the creature at 2 a.m., after changing a tire on his car. `` The moonlight was out. I turned around and saw a red-eyed devil. He was about 30 yards from me, in the field. It had real long arms. When he would run, his arms would swing,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said he drove off and the creature jumped on the roof, but apparently fell off. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> did n't tell authorities about the experience until later, when he heard that a couple had reported a similar creature had pulled chrome and molding off their car.

<HEAD>Prosecutors Cite Little Success in Drug War</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Most of 181 local prosecutors interviewed by a weekly legal affairs newspaper said they are having little or no impact in the war against drugs, despite higher spending, the paper reported Monday. The prosecutors called for more money for their efforts and rated some federal drug-fighting policies as little help, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> said. It said a quarter of the prosecutors favored decriminalizing marijuana. Sixty-five percent of the prosecutors who were interviewed said their resources were inadequate to fight drugs. As well as more money, most called for laws making it easier to seize property from drug offenders. But more than seven in 10 of those interviewed called the federal government's `` zero tolerance'' program `` not very important'' or `` not important,'' the Journal said. That program includes moves to seize property in which federal agents find even a minuscule amount of illegal drugs. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said Monday he believed prosecutors would favor the zero-tolerance program if they knew fully about it. He also said the department strongly opposed marijuana decriminalization. The Journal said it interviewed the chief prosecutors or their top drug deputies in 181 of the 250 largest local jurisdictions in the country this month. The local prosecutors were promised confidentiality. Statewide and federal prosecutors were not interviewed. When asked about the effect of their work, six in 10 of those interviewed said they had very little or no impact in reducing the illegal drug supply; about as many said they had little or no impact raising the price of drugs; and 57 percent said they had little or no impact deterring drug use.

<HEAD>Anglican Bishops Reject Call To Keep from Consecrating Women
Bishops</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CANTERBURY, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The world's Anglican bishops on Monday rejected a call to refrain from consecrating women bishops and accepted a compromise resolution that such elevation of women should not divide the <ORGANIZATION> Anglican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communion </ORGANIZATION>. On a show of hands, the bishops voted 423-28 with 19 abstentions to maintain links with any of their 27 self-governing churches which consecrate a woman bishop, even if they disagree. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Episcopalians and the Canadian and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> Anglicans say they may consecrate a woman bishop by the end of this year. The resolution preserving the unity of the 70 million-member Anglican Communion was drafted by conference participants who considered it for most of the first two weeks of the three-week <ORGANIZATION> Lambeth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>. It is the bishops' first gathering in 10 years. On a secret ballot, the bishops voted 277-187 against a resolution proposed by Archbishop of <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION> <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> that the churches should `` refrain from consecrating a woman as bishop'' to avoid further damage over the issue of women priests and bishops. Archbishop of Canterbury <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON>, spiritual leader of the Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Anglican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communion </ORGANIZATION>, said after the two votes that despite differences of opinion, the conference acted in a spirit of unity. <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> said before the vote that however the count went, he agreed with its recommendation that he appoint a commission to prepare guidelines for relations among the churches once women bishops are appointed. He said his commission would `` start meetings well before the end of this year.'' <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> said of the compromise resolution, `` It was n't a fudge _ it was very carefully worked out respecting of differences and the determination to live together. ... Tell me what other way you hold a communion together when it is deeply divided about something which is of great importance to some people and of little importance to others in the mission of the church.'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, metropolitan of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>, said his resolution simply invited the conference to express its mind. `` It is contrary to the explicit teaching of the New Testament that women be given responsibility for the authority of the Scriptures in the congregation,'' he said. But Presiding Bishop <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, which has ordained hundreds of women priests in the past 11 years, differed. `` Restraint is not a true option,'' <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> said. `` When we heard or read that it is only a matter of time before women will be elected bishops in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, this is not a statement of defiance. It is simply looking into our future as a province -LRB- church -RRB- based on our past and our present. `` Ordained women are already a feature of our church life. Our people have been blessed by the priestly ministry of ordained women for more than a decade. Therefore, the people of our diocese move ahead toward calling women to be bishops in a way that is authentic to our experience.'' Many of the Anglican bishops, clergy and laity oppose ordaining women. About 1,200 women priests have been ordained by a minority of the churches, mostly by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Episcopalians. Opponents call the practice contrary to Scripture and tradition. They say they could not accept a woman bishop though they might eventually accept women priests. Bishops are regarded as the successors of the Apostles of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>. All were men. Bishop <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Pwaisiho </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Malaita </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> territory of <LOCATION> Melanesia </LOCATION>, denounced ordaining women as `` Satanic.'' `` I think you are not listening to us _ and my color does n't help, either,'' said <PERSON> Pwaisiho </PERSON>, who is black `` No woman should be consecrated for the sake of the unity we seek,'' appealed another African prelate, Bishop <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Nwankiti </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Owerri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>. But a black prelate from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, Bishop <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, said white men who had long prevented blacks from becoming bishops were now using the same arguments against women. `` In Christ there is neither male nor female,'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said.

 Drunken-driving experts and bus safety officials will join witnesses to a bus crash that killed 27 people when testimony gets under way Tuesday in a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> hearing. The May 17 accident occurred when a pickup truck going the wrong way on Interstate 71 slammed into a bus owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Radcliff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> of God church. Authorities contend the driver of the pickup was drunk at the time. <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> said accident survivors probably will not testify because the agency does n't want to traumatize them. The pickup driver, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, 35, has been indicted on 27 counts of murder, 13 counts of first-degree assault, 44 counts of first-degree wanton endangerment and one count of drunken driving. It will be the worst drunken-driving accident in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history if he is convicted on the final charge, according to the <ORGANIZATION> NTBS </ORGANIZATION> and Mothers Against Drunk Driving. The board will hear testimony on six issues, five of which concern drunken driving, <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> said. The sixth involves bus safety. <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> said testimony will be taken on the performance and capabilities of drivers under the influence of alcohol; the extent of the drunken-driving problem; and the effectiveness of alcohol education and treatment programs. He said the witnesses also will address the adequacy of sanctions <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>'s courts impose on drunken drivers and the development of effective alcohol countermeasure programs like jail terms, fines and license revocation. The accident has raised questions about bus safety because all 67 passengers on board survived the impact but the victims died when the bus's gas tank was punctured, causing a fire that quickly engulfed the vehicle. The fire blocked the front door, leaving the rear emergency door as the only escape route. The safety issues to be discussed include emergency exits; the upgrading of buses built before April 1977 when stricter federal safety rules became effective; the flammability of seats; and the placement and protection of the fuel tank. The board will draft a report on the probable causes of the crash and make recommendations for avoiding similar accidents. The recommendations could be directed toward federal, state and local officials, as well as bus manufacturers, but the safety board has no power to require that any of them be implemented.

 A deliveryman who foiled a robbery by ramming his truck into a getaway car says he just wanted to get the thieves' license number _ but he was angry, too. `` I was a little mad that I walked in for a delivery and I was getting robbed, while I was at work,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Swartz </PERSON>, 30, a driver for <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parcel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. At a preliminary hearing last Friday, <PERSON> Swartz </PERSON> identified the suspects, <PERSON> Gillie </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, 50, and <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON>, 31, as the men who were robbing <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Surplus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> when <PERSON> Swartz </PERSON> made a delivery to the store in the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> suburb of Mountain View on June 16. The intruders had bound three employees in a back office, emptied the cash register and robbed several customers when the <ORGANIZATION> UPS </ORGANIZATION> driver walked in, authorities said. <PERSON> Swartz </PERSON> said he, too, was robbed. As the men fled with about $ 400, <PERSON> Swartz </PERSON> followed them out. `` I decided to go get the license number,'' he said. He got into his <ORGANIZATION> UPS </ORGANIZATION> truck and drove around to the side of the store, where he saw a Cadillac coming at him with one robber inside. He rammed his truck into the car, <PERSON> Swartz </PERSON> said. Police arrested <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON> at the scene, and later took <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> into custody in nearby <LOCATION> Lakewood </LOCATION>. The episode received national attention because an initial report quoted witnesses as saying <PERSON> Swartz </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> UPS </ORGANIZATION> supervisor had `` cursed'' him for damaging the company truck and threatened to take away his good driving record, a basis for promotions. <PERSON> Swartz </PERSON> and the company later said the supervisor had not cursed <PERSON> Swartz </PERSON>, and <ORGANIZATION> UPS </ORGANIZATION> praised the driver's actions, saying the collision would not be charged against his record. The company honored <PERSON> Swartz </PERSON> for heroism at a reception June 24. In Friday's hearing, <ORGANIZATION> Jefferson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> concluded there was sufficient evidence to try both suspects on six counts each of aggravated robbery and one count each of felony menacing.

 The <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> farmer who was shot down over <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> last year and imprisoned there for 56 days has returned to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in hopes of retrieving his airplane, his brother said Monday. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Denby </PERSON> said his brother <PERSON> James </PERSON> is trying to clear a lien that was placed on the plane to ensure payment of fees to the lawyer who represented him in Nicaraguan courts. `` All he said was, ` Hey, I'm going to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,''' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Denby </PERSON>, who said his brother had been in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> for `` a couple of weeks.'' On Dec. 6, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Denby </PERSON> was flying to a farm he owns in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> when his single-engine <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> was hit by rifle fire and he was forced to land on the Nicaraguan coast. Nicaraguan officials said they found documents linking <PERSON> Denby </PERSON> to U.S.-backed Contra rebels fighting the country's leftist Sandinista government. <PERSON> Denby </PERSON> denied the allegations, although he said in a 1987 interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that he had ferried wounded Contras to hospitals in his plane. He was acquitted by a Nicaraguan court in early February. At the time, <PERSON> Denby </PERSON> said in news interviews he would be very reluctant to return to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. `` They would have to send an aircraft carrier,'' he said. But <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Denby </PERSON> indicated his brother had received assurances that he would be safe. `` I'm sure he was not concerned about his well-being in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Denby </PERSON> said He said that during this visit, his brother `` said he was treated better in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> than in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>,'' where officials had not been formally notified that the Nicaraguan charges had been dropped. Though he said his information was sketchy, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Denby </PERSON> said his brother `` apparently has gotten or is getting his aircraft back from the government.'' Telephone calls to <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Denby </PERSON>'s family home near <LOCATION> Carlinville </LOCATION> were not answered Monday.

<HEAD>Hospital Ordered to Justify Hinckley Field Trip</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The mental hospital where <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> is being held was ordered Monday to justify its plan to allow the presidential assailant to join a day-long field trip outside the hospital with other patients. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Barrington </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> granted a request by federal prosecutors for a court hearing on the proposal by <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elizabeths </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> to let <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> go on a supervised `` recreational'' day trip away from the guarded facility. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> gave the hospital until Friday to file with him all treatment records and other documents to support its conclusion that <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> would `` benefit therapeutically'' from the trip and that he could participate `` without posing a danger to himself or to others.'' <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON>, who shot and wounded President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and three others on March 31, 1981, has been held at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elizabeths </ORGANIZATION> since 1982, when he was acquitted of criminal charges by reason of insanity. Last year, the government successfully opposed an attempt by hospital authorities to allow <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> to visit his parents over the Easter weekend. The proposal was withdrawn after it was disclosed in court that <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> had corresponded with convicted multiple murderer <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>, who is on <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s death row. The <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said it opposed the hospital's latest plan, which was outlined in a July 19 letter to the judge. The letter did not specify what sorts of activities the field trip would involve. Hospital officials said they might include bowling, a picnic or music.

<TEXT>
 Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> envoy <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> and the other foreign hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> may be released by the end of the year, an Anglican archbishop back from discussions in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> predicted Monday. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, meanwhile, said it is reviewing its strained relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, further fueling hopes of freedom for hostages believed held by pro-Iranian extremists in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The news followed a weekend in which Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> spoke of improving British-Iranian relations and the Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> announced it had sent a church official on a hostage mission to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Penman </PERSON>, the archbishop for <LOCATION> Melbourne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, and an expert on Islam, said after his trip to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> that `` intuition'' leads him to believe the hostages will be released from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> after <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s Nov. 1 elections and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> elections a week later. `` I would not be surprised if <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> and the others were released before the end of the year,'' <PERSON> Penman </PERSON> told a news conference in <LOCATION> Canterbury </LOCATION>, where he is attending an international conference of Anglican bishops. He visited <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> on his way to <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> last month. <PERSON> Penman </PERSON> said he had discussions about <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> `` with some of my hosts, but I can not talk about them.'' <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> disappeared in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> Jan. 20, 1987, while seeking the release of American hostages. No one has claimed to hold him. Seventeen other foreigners, including nine Americans, are believed held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The longest held is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 40, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He was abducted March 16, 1985. <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> David </PERSON>, said he hoped <PERSON> Penman </PERSON> was right about the hostages' release, but warned `` the moment you start talking about it being over by such and such a date, and that date passes, it is a big anticlimax.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> expressed hope for improved relations in a letter to <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> which was made public Saturday. Two <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> newspapers, The Independent and <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION>, reported Monday that <PERSON> Penman </PERSON> was on a mission for <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON>, but <PERSON> Penman </PERSON> said he was invited by the Iranians and the trip's primary purpose was to discuss Iranian-Australian relations. Bishop <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, whose diocese includes <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> and all <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> nations except <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, went to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> at <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON>'s request last week to speak to Lbanese Christian leaders about four Iranians who disappeared while traveling in a Christian-controlled zone outside <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in July 1982. They were presumed kidnapped, but no one claimed responsibility. There have been unconfirmed reports that they were killed. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said Sunday that he hoped his mission contributed `` towards the overall picture which I hope will lead towards the release of all the hostages.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s review of relations with <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> follows <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s acceptance of a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolution calling for a cease-fire in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s 8-year-old war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. `` British ministers are reviewing the whole gamut of Anglo-Iranian relations, including the possibility of sending a diplomat to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> for a short period of time,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> all but broke off diplomatic relations last summer after an Iranian envoy was arrested for shoplifting in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> diplomat was arrested and beaten in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> left its mission in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> vacant, but <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has kept its charge d'affairs, <PERSON> Akunzadeh </PERSON> <PERSON> Basti </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Basti </PERSON> said Monday, following an hourlong meeting at the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, that `` a better atmosphere is developing.''

 Passengers said the pilot went on the intercom to brag about the advanced electronic wizardry aboard their 2-week-old <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> jetliner. Minutes later, the plane overshot a runway and wound up mired in the mud. None of the 87 passengers and six crew members was injured when flight 278 from <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> ran out of runway during the Monday morning landing at <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Regional </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, said airline and aviation officials. The flight was to have continued to <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>. Passenger <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Laraway </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> said those aboard remained calm when the plane came to a halt and many laughed when a flight attendant said, `` Welcome to <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION>.'' `` A half hour later we are standing in line out here -LRB- to book new flights to <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION> -RRB-, saying, ` Yeah, it's got all these digital readouts and whatnot, but the brakes still work the same way, you've got to put your foot on the brake pedal,' `` Laraway said. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> said there was no immediate indication what caused the <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell-Douglas </ORGANIZATION> twin-jet aircraft, an updated version of the DC-9, to roll off the end of the runway, but he said the plane `` appeared to have landed late.'' Passenger <PERSON> Cyril </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, who said he usually flies at least a couple of times every week, said the jetliner appeared to be coming down faster than normal and the braking was sudden when it touched down. `` I could feel that the pilot was trying to exert the brakes with some urgency,'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said. `` When I looked out the window again we were approaching a grassy area. We did n't finally stop until we hit that grass area.'' The rear 15 or 20 feet of the plane remained over the end of the runway, said Airport Director <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> were investigating. <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> officials were interviewing the pilots Monday afternoon, but the airline does not disclose identities of crew members, said <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Pate </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. She said she was unable to respond to comments by passengers because the investigation was still under way. `` A lot of times passengers perceive things differently than what actually has gone on,'' Ms. <PERSON> Pate </PERSON> said. The main runway was closed for nearly five hours while crews removed the jetliner, but airport operations were unaffected as aircraft were able to use another runway, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. He said there was no apparent damage and <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> was preparing to ferry the plane back to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> wants to keep buying weapons from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, although it also will build its stock with purchases from elsewhere, the Saudi embassy said Monday. Seeking to dispel any notion of a U.S.-Saudi rift, the embassy released a statement on the Saudi decision to buy $ 17 billion worth of military equipment, including 50 Tornado jet fighters, from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. `` The kingdom would like to reiterate its desire to obtain its military requirements, including advanced aircraft and defense arms, from American plants, with the full conviction of our peaceful intentions..,'' the statement said It was attributed to an unnamed source who was quoted by the <ORGANIZATION> Saudi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has complained that the deal was not in the interest of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. For decades the Saudis relied mainly on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to supply weapons, but supporters of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> have blocked the sale of some sophisticated weapons, claiming they could be used against the Jewish state. The statement said the British sale `` will not affect, either in the short-term or long-term the strength of ties between'' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION>. Although the Saudis will continue trying to secure weapons from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, they will buy from any country as long as there are no restrictions, the statement said. Last week, King <PERSON> Fahd </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> will not hesitate to purchase weapons from communist suppliers.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The 1984 presidential campaign committee of Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, has agreed to pay a $ 30,000 civil penalty to settle alleged violations of federal election law, officials said Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said it had found probable cause to believe that the <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> committee and its treasurer, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, accepted excessive campaign contributions, misreported cash and spending levels and exceeded spending limits. The information was made public in a voluntary `` conciliation agreement'' between the agency and the committee that was released by the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> charged that the <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> committee accepted a total of $ 81,326 in excessive campaign contributions and exceeded presidential primary spending limits in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> by $ 149,439 and in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> by $ 219,348. The agency said the committee apparently accepted excess contributions from 126 individuals, seven partnerships and four political committees. It said that while the committee issued $ 51,676 in refunds and legally `` reattributed'' $ 30,025 to other donors, the actions were not taken in a timely manner. The committee had argued that the law allows it to determine whether a contribution is legal and gives it a `` reasonable time'' to refund any amounts exceeding the limit. It said it proceeded with `` reasonable diligence'' in making that determination and issued the refunds in a reasonable time. The <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> also charged that the committee understated spending and overstated its cash on hand between April 1983 and March 1984 in its reports to the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Police: Toll Taker Opened Her Own Lanes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Turnpike </LOCATION> toll booth manager who opened her own lanes allegedly kept as much as $ 15,000 paid by motorists, a state transportation official said. <PERSON> Lorna </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoff </PERSON>, 33, was arrested April 2 after a stakeout by <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> and state attorney's office investigators at the <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> Gardens Interchange. She had $ 844 and 750 toll tickets with her when she was stopped, authorities said. According to <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Valentine </PERSON>, a state attorney's investigator who headed the operation, Ms. <PERSON> Hoff </PERSON> subsequently admitted to having pilfered `` several hundred dollars'' worth of tolls on `` two or three'' occasions following her promotion to manager March 4. Ms. <PERSON> Hoff </PERSON>'s admission led to dismissal from her $ 17,394-a-year job, and she was charged with grand theft. Her 10-year tenure with the <ORGANIZATION> DOT </ORGANIZATION> coupled with the fact that she had no prior record led prosecutors to agree to drop the charge when she agreed to pay back the $ 844 and take part in a pre-trial intervention program. But the <ORGANIZATION> DOT </ORGANIZATION> refused to consent to the pre-trial deal, leaving the grand theft charge standing. And DOT chief of toll facilities <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> now says she may have stolen as much as $ 15,000. Subsequent investigation into <PERSON> Hoff </PERSON>'s activities has led the state to believe the former toll manager may have milked a single toll lane about 14 times, he said. `` We've been working reconstructing certain reports and determined it's a lot more than $ 844,'' <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> said evidence indicated that <PERSON> Hoff </PERSON>, who as manager was not actually supposed to work a toll booth, had kept toll funds on days she took regular attendants off the work schedule and put herself on an operating lane. He said this was noticed because the regular attendants were logged in for the day's work, but their end-of-day receipts were not reported.

 <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>'s luxury Acura cars ranked highest in customer satisfaction for the second consecutive year in a consumer survey that found only two American nameplates in the top 10. The rankings released Monday by <PERSON> J.D </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, an auto industry research group, were based on questionnaires completed by 25,200 motorists one year after they bought their cars. Ranked in order, the top 10 models were Acura, <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>, Cadillac, <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> BMW </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Volvo </ORGANIZATION>, and, tied for ninth, <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION>. The survey covered 158 car models from 34 automakers and measured customer satisfaction with both the product and with the dealers that sell and service them. Acura, the luxury division of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sales </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> that sells two models, also placed first in the 1987 survey, the first year it was included. <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> itself ranked third this year, and <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION> was second. Satisfaction with the industry overall improved in 1988, J.D. <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> said, attributing the improvement to increased reliability of the cars and efforts to improve dealer service. Ranked by country of origin, Asian carmakers scored highest, followed by European automakers, with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> car industry ranked last. <PERSON> J.D </PERSON>. Power, which conducts its survey primarily for sale to automakers for their internal use, does not release survey results on cars or automakers that rate poorly. Here is how the top 10 were rated in the survey in three categories _ overall customer satisfaction, handling, and repair and reliability. The numbers, derived from answers to the questionnaires, have comparative meaning only. 1.

 King <PERSON> Bhumibol </PERSON> <PERSON> Adulyadej </PERSON> opened the new <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Monday and is expected to name a 66-year-old former general as prime minister. Elections were held July 24 for the 357-seat <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> and a five-party coalition was formed because none of the 16 parties won a majority. A majority of the membership nominated <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON> <PERSON> Choonhavan </PERSON>, the former general who leads the Chart Thai -LRB- Thai Nation -RRB- party, for a four-year term as premier. The Chart Thai won more seats than any other party.

<HEAD>Reagan Hears Arguments For And Against Anti-Pollution Pact</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> heard arguments Monday for and against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> participation in a treaty aimed at freezing emissions of an important precursor of acid rain. The pollutant in question, oxides of nitrogen, accounts for about one-third of the acidity in rainfall in the eastern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. The Cabinet's Domestic Policy Council, with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> presiding, was briefed on a proposal coming from a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations-sponsored </ORGANIZATION> negotiation that would freeze emissions until 1996, pending further research on the effects of nitrogen oxides and how to reduce them. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> made no decision, but participants expect one soon. Oxides of nitrogen are formed in the combustion of fossil fuels in industry, utilities and motor vehicles. In the air they may be transformed into nitric acid. In urban areas they are an essential raw material for making smog. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> emissions have been roughly steady since 1980 and according to <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> projections should remain that way until about 1995, when slow increases should start. The 21.3 million tons emitted in 1986, the most recent year available, were 8.5 percent below the peak year of 1978. According to two participants in discussions over the issue, both of whom spoke on condition of anonymity, the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> supports joining the treaty while the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, supported by the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> departments and the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>, opposes it. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> spokesmen declined to discuss their agency's participation in the meeting. The telephone of an Energy Department official to whom questions were referred did not answer. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1985 declined to join a similar international agreement calling for a 30 percent reduction in emissions of the other major precursor of acid rain, sulfur dioxide.

 Two men with pistols and grenades forced an airliner to land on an abandoned runway Monday, where they seized a gold shipment and robbed the 22 passengers, <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> police said. A police statement said the propeller-driven Twin Otter plane of the Colombian airline ACES was on a flight from the northwest town of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bagre </LOCATION> to the industrial city of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> when forced to land near <LOCATION> Campamento </LOCATION> <LOCATION> village </LOCATION>, about 60 miles southwest of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bagre </LOCATION>. Six other gunmen joined the two hijackers and took the gold and passengers' jewelry, money and other valuables, the statement said. The cargo of gold came from a mine near <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bagre </LOCATION> and was valued at $ 500,000, police said. The gunmen smashed the plane's radio, kicked the co-pilot in the face, warned the pilot not to take off for an hour and then fled into the jungle, police said. The plane took off from the grass runway after an hour and landed safely in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>.

 A federal appeals court Monday upheld the 1987 conviction of Rep. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, while a jury deliberated racketeering charges against him in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> corruption trial. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Constance </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Motley </PERSON> immediately sequestered the jury in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> case at the request of <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>'s lawyer, who called the appeals court ruling `` a great problem for us. <PERSON> Motley </PERSON> had planned to sequester the jury beginning Tuesday night after late arriving jurors on Monday were confronted by demonstrators outside the courthouse, chanting `` Down with political corruption'' and `` Compensate <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> workers.'' The jury ended its third day of deliberations Monday without a verdict. Monday's ruling by the 2nd <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>'s Sept. 22, 1987, conviction for obstructing justice and accepting an unlawful gratuity. <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> was convicted of accepting free <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> vacations with a female companion from former <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> Democratic leader <PERSON> Meade </PERSON> <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON>. The appeals panel also upheld the conviction of the 80-year-old <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON>. <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, 71, a 10-term congressman from the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, was convicted by a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> on three felony counts: accepting an illegal gratuity, traveling across state lines to accept the gratuity and obstruction of justice. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> sentenced <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> to 30 months in prison and a $ 500,000 fine. <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> has been free pending appeal, and his attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRossa </PERSON> said <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> would try to pursue his appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The original jury acquitted <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON> of the more serious charges of bribery and conspiracy. Prosecutors said <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON> paid for one vacation and arranged to pay for another in exchange for the congressman's efforts on behalf of a <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> ship repair company that was a major client of <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON>'s insurance brokerage. In the current trial, <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> and six defendants are charged with turning the now-defunct <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> into a racketeering enterprise that paid out millions of dollars in bribes to obtain no-bid government contracts. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee recommended in February 1988 that <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> be expelled for `` criminal conduct ... going to the heart of his representational responsibilities.'' In an unusual maneuver, however, congressional leaders decided to delay action while <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> defended himself in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> trial. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Davison </PERSON>, a spokesman for the ethics committee, declined to comment on what effect the appeals court ruling would have.

<HEAD>Doctor Quits In Animal-To-Human Transplants Controversy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A British surgeon involved in a plan to use pigs' organs for human transplants abruptly quit the project Monday in a dispute with colleagues, but said research would continue Dr. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bewick </PERSON> said fellow researchers at <LOCATION> Dulwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, in south <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, told him to `` shut up or get out'' following a day where battle lines were drawn between scientists and animal rights activists. <PERSON> Bewick </PERSON>, 52, a kidney transplant specialist, said the research team was furious that without their consent he had announced the hospital intended to study the feasibility of transplanting kidneys, livers and hearts from pigs into people. Animal rights groups responded to the press coverage by labeling the idea a `` horror fantasy'' and `` gross abuse of animal life.'' They asked the government to ban the project. <PERSON> Bewick </PERSON> said the research team feared the controversy might harm its chances of obtaining facilities to carry out the work. `` For the sake of the group and the work they are doing, I decided it would be right for me to leave,'' <PERSON> Bewick </PERSON> said. He stressed the group had `` the brains and technical skills'' to proceed without him. A hospital spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he would meet with <PERSON> Bewick </PERSON> and the research team Tuesday to assess the situation. <PERSON> Bewick </PERSON> was quoted in the Independent newspaper Monday, as saying in earlier comments that the program posed `` no ethical problem... Animal kidneys could save the lives of thousands of people who die because we do not have an off-the-shelf kidney.'' Before withdrawing from the project, <PERSON> Bewick </PERSON> had offered to meet with animal rights groups to discuss their concerns. He said he feared attacks on his personal property and the hospital. Attempts to transplant animal organs into humans, including sheep, baboon and chimpanzee hearts, have failed. In what was probably the most publicized case, Dr. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> transplanted a baboon heart into a 12-day-old infant, dubbed Baby Fae, at the <LOCATION> Loma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Linda </LOCATION> medical facility in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in 1984. She died 20 days later. A year after the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> baby's death, <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said she died not from rejection of heart tissue but from another form of rejection which he said he believes is possible to avoid. <PERSON> Bewick </PERSON> said over the weekend that the hospital research team found a way to filter out antibodies that cause humans to reject donor organs. He said the new technique had helped 20 patients accept human kidneys more easily. Researchers had planned experiments this fall to see whether the technique worked between different species of animals _ pigs and sheep. If successful, <PERSON> Bewick </PERSON> had estimated pig-to-human transplants could begin within three years. But the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection condemned the research program as a `` gross abuse of animal life and waste of health care resources.'' `` The experimental animals will undoubtedly suffer greatly both physically and mentally despite the fact that anesthetics will be used,'' an unidentified spokesman said. <PERSON> Bewick </PERSON> had said pigs were the most suitable animals because their organs physiologically most resemble those of humans. Another pressure group, Animal Concern <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, said animal research would be unnecessary if more people agreed to donate their organs after death. `` The idea of breeding pigs as living organ banks owes more to sick horror fantasy than medical science'' said a spokesman, who refused to be identified. `` I hope the -LRB- government -RRB- will use some common sense and ban this approach.'' The Sunday Times quoted <PERSON> Bewick </PERSON> as saying he had obtained approval for the experiments from the hospital's ethics committee. A spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that panel's approval made the project acceptable if it seemed likely to yield some benefit. She said society ultimately would decide the future of animal-to-human transplants. The controversy highlighted the need for a national ethics committee, she said.

 A preliminary <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> inquiry into allegations the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> administration gave developers confidential information about prison-siting plans has ended with no charges filed. Law enforcement sources, speaking only on condition they not be named, said the investigation turned up no evidence of federal violations. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cloherty </PERSON> said, `` The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is conducting no further investigation with regard to the placing of a state prison at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Braintree </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, and-or the procurement of land for that prison.'' He declined to characterize the outcome of the inquiry other than to say no charges had been filed. <PERSON> Cloherty </PERSON> also declined to say whether any evidence had been forwarded for grand jury review. However, two law enforcement sources said the inquiry found no evidence that federal laws had been broken. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, deputy press spokesman for the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, refused to say whether law enforcement officials had informed the administration that the inquiry had ended. But when told of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> statement and law enforcement comment, <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said: `` It was always our contention that this was an open process, above the board. We will go forward with the implementation of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Braintree </LOCATION> plan.'' Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in 1986 formally announced plans to build a 500-bed, medium-security prison in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Braintree </LOCATION> at the site of a defunct religious academy. The site had been discussed informally for a prison or other state institution beginning in 1984. Prison opponents, largely residents of the rural town of 800 people, complained that the inmate and staff population would overrun their farming community. Later, some opponents alleged that the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> administration, unable to buy the land directly because the church that owned it had agreed with town officials not to sell it for projects including a prison, leaked its interest in the site to two developers who bought it and then offered it to the state. The allegations have been cited by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> critics to attack the good-government pledges that are a major theme of his presidential campaign. National publicity followed the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s confirmation June 23 that a preliminary inquiry was under way. At that time, the agency said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> himself was not a target of any investigation. The developers, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Striar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON>, offered the land to the state for $ 9.5 million. But the state has offered only $ 5 million, citing three appraisals, commissioned by the state, that listed its value at or just below $ 5 million. <PERSON> Striar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> have rejected the state's offer as too low but the state notified <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Braintree </LOCATION> officials in a letter mailed last week that the purchase would go forward. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradshaw </PERSON>, associate deputy commissioner of the state Division of Capital Planning and Operations, said the state will take the land by eminent domain if the owners do not change their stance. The seizure likely will take place in mid-October or November, he said Monday. <PERSON> Bradshaw </PERSON> said his agency had not been informed that the inquiry had ended. `` None of my people were questioned as part of it and we have n't talked to them today either,'' he said `` We did n't feel it was necessary for any investigation. However, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has a role to complete and if they have done that and feel there is no evidence of wrongdoing then I'm certainly happy.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> has punished two female Marines because they testified at a court-martial on behalf of a female sergeant who was accused of lesbianism at <LOCATION> Parris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. And a specialist in military legal affairs said the action may have damaged future efforts to prosecute female Marines accused of lesbianism. Staff Sgts. <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurule </PERSON> and <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilinski </PERSON>, who testified as character witnesses at Sgt. <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Jameson </PERSON>'s court-martial July 14, were removed from the drill field July 18 and reassigned to other areas Also, their military occupational specialities were voided, which means their permanent records will show they had an unsuccessful tour of duty on the drill field. Ms. <PERSON> Hilsinki </PERSON> was n't actually assigned to the drill field when she was removed but was on a routine six-month `` quota,'' in this case serving as a depot inspector <PERSON> Jameson </PERSON> pleaded guilty to engaging in indecent acts and charges of sodomy and obstruction of justice were dropped. She was sentenced to a year in prison, reduced to private and dishonorably discharged. <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> DiBattiste </PERSON> said military judges could throw out any more cases that go to trial if they believe the Corps tried to frighten potential defense witnesses. Ms. <PERSON> DiBattiste </PERSON> is an instructor in the military justice division at the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Judge Advocate General's School's at <ORGANIZATION> Maxwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>. `` The problem is when you start trying to scare witnesses,'' said Ms. <PERSON> DiBattiste </PERSON>. `` If they can prove it ... the accused might have a successful claim.'' Attorneys charge that by removing the two women from their jobs, and by holding `` informational briefings'' with other female Marines to explain the actions, <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> officials have frightened others from coming forward to testify for their clients. `` The word is out: You do n't testify for women accused of being a homosexual,'' said <PERSON> Vaughan </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, an attorney for several women accused in the investigation. The Uniform Code of Military Justice, which governs all branches of the military, prohibits illegal command influence, which `` involves anyone in a position of command who tries to influence the outcome of a court-martial.'' That section of the code has been interpreted by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> to mean, for example, that commanders ca n't try to persuade potential witnesses not to testify, according to court opinions. But <LOCATION> Parris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> officials, who acknowledge punishing the women for their testimony but do n't acknowledge holding the briefings, said they've done nothing improper or illegal. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depot </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Parris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, 1st Lt. A.J. <PERSON> Kozloski </PERSON>, said the women were relieved of their duties as drill instructors because of their testimony. `` They were relieved as a result of loss of confidence by thir superiors based on the content of their testimony under oath in the <PERSON> Jameson </PERSON> case,'' <PERSON> Kozloski </PERSON> said. `` This is purely an administrative action. No one is being punished merely for testifying. <PERSON> Gurule </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hilinski </PERSON> testified they would be willing to work with Ms. <PERSON> Jameson </PERSON>. `` The fact is that if a Marine in a position of high responsibility such as a drill instructor makes a statement under oath that -LRB- shows -RRB- he or she does n't understand or support an order directly governing his or her duties, it is within the discretion of the commander to consider removing that individual from that specific postion.'' Ms. <PERSON> DiBattiste </PERSON> said that although officers could be court-martialed if found guilty of engaging in illegal command influence, such charges are usually dropped. `` All I can tell you is I think that's an appropriate allegation for defense council to make,'' Ms. <PERSON> DiBattiste </PERSON> said. `` I would not render an opinion to you whether they would win or lose.''

Because of the dual campaign, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> would be able to spend the $ 4 million in private money raised for his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> contest on top of the federal money for his vice presidential campaign, which is limited for both parties. The committee asked the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> to withhold the $ 46 million in federal funding due the <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis-Bentsen </PERSON> ticket, but the commission two weeks ago voted 6-0 to reject that request. The money was then transferred from the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> to the campaign. The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> is now asking the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> to block the Democrats from spending the money. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s attorneys also filed a brief on Monday asking that the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> request be rejected.

<HEAD>Government Ordered To Change Or Delete Unconstitutionally Vague
Language</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A federal judge has ordered the government to change or delete unconstitutionally vague language in pledges signed by 1.7 million government workers not to disclose top-secret information. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON> ordered the modification in the non-disclosure pledges signed by government workers with access to top-secret information must sign to retain their security clearances. In an order signed Friday and made public Monday, the judge said the government must provide a more specific definition of the term `` classifiable information.'' In signing the various pledges, government employees promise not to make unauthorized disclosures of top-secret information or `` classifiable information.'' <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON> gave the <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oversight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> 60 days to notify the federal employees of the government's definition or `` classifiable information'' or to declare the term inoperative. Until that notification is made, the government can not penalize employees who disclose `` classifiable information,'' the judge said. A more specific definition must also be included in forms presented to federal employees who have not yet signed the pledge or the term must be deleted, the judge said. The ruling was made in a lawsuit by two federal employees unions that contended the pledges use throughout the executive branch empowered government agencies to penalize whistleblowers by classifying information after it was disclosed to the press or members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON> suggested that the security agency, headed by <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Garfinkel </PERSON>, could adopt a definition published late last year in the Federal Register. That regulation defined `` classifiable information'' as any unstamped material or oral conversations that an employee has a good reason to know should be classified. Such information would include material that was in the process of being reviewed for classification, according to the regulatory definition published Dec. 21, 1987. <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON> upheld the validity of that definition, saying: `` much classified information is not marked as such because it has not been examined by a classification authority. The govenrment nevertheless has a substantial interest in safeguarding that information.'' The 1987 definition `` simply requires that employees consider whether they have reason to believe that unmarked information is classified or should be classified and is in the process of becoming so,'' <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON> said. The regulation was offered to allay concerns raised by the plaintiffs who brought the lawsuit. But <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON> said that `` until an employee becomes aware of the regulatory definition, he can not know what ` classifiable' information does not include, for example, information that only speculation suggests will become classified. `` Notice of the definition is essential,'' the judge said. The decision was hailed by both sides of the dispute. <PERSON> Garfinkel </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON> had upheld the general principle that federal employees can be required to sign secrecy pledges. `` I think essentially its a victory for the broader principle. It will require us to do something more as far as the forms that hae already been signed is concerned,'' <PERSON> Garfinkel </PERSON> said. `` We will have to decide which option to take.'' <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, an attorney for <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Litigation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a consumer lobby that filed a friend-of-the-court brief for several members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said the order `` teaches a lesson to the government that they have to be more careful when they are crafting these agreements.''

 The army on Monday deported to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> eight Palestinians accused of inciting the 8-month-old uprising in the occupied lands, where a two-day general strike was launched to protest <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s policy of expulsions. Security sources said six more Palestinians were handed deportation orders under emergency regulations enacted by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in August 1985, but defense officials denied the report. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, troops wounded two Palestinian youths, including a 12-year-old boy shot in the neck, after masked protesters stoned the soldiers' jeep, officials at <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ittihad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> said. The hospital and defense officials spoke on condition of anonymity, as did the security sources. The deportations brought to 29 the number of Palestinians banished since the insurrection began on Dec. 8 in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. The insurrection has killed 235 Palestinians and four Israelis. The deportees were visited by their families at Jneid prison near <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> hours before being expelled. Relatives said they watched the men being driven away in unmarked cars, the windows blocked by newspapers and plastic bags. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television said an army helicopter took the deportees to southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, where they were placed in waiting taxis after being giving a medical checkup and offered $ 50 each. Only three accepted the money, the report said. Television segments showed one man flashing a victory sign as he climbed into the taxi. An army spokesman said the eight were senior activists in guerrilla organizations and accused them of `` inciteful and subversive activities.'' Among the deportees was a journalist with <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s Arabic-language <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fajr </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, <PERSON> Loui </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Nafeh </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdu </PERSON>, who was accused of being a senior activist in the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> Others included a <ORGANIZATION> Bir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> lecturer and a labor leader from <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bireh </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Fajr </PERSON> managing editor <PERSON> Maher </PERSON> <PERSON> Abukhater </PERSON> denounced the deportations as `` an extreme form of punishment and obvious violation of basic human rights.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration also has criticized the policy. A leaflet circulated on July 21 called for a Monday-Tuesday strike to protest such deportations. Palestinians meanwhile painted graffiti on walls denouncing <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> for announcing plans to sever ties with the 850,000 Palestinians in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. `` Down with <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> the traitor,'' read one slogan in <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION>. Other Palestinians praised the move. `` It should start the ball rolling in the direction of working out strategic relationships between the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> on the future,'' <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> journalist <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuttab </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Nazareth </LOCATION> daily A-Sinara told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> `` dealt a blow'' to the idea of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state by differentiating between Palestinians living on the east bank of the <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and those in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. `` If, as <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> says, one part of them has to set up a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state and another part is <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> ... where then is the one Palestinian people?,'' an aide quoted <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> as saying in a meeting with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>'s new ambassador. `` It is possible to draw the conclusion that the whole idea of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> people is an invention for the sake of propaganda.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc opposes territorial concessions to the Arabs. A government official disclosed Monday that Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> tried through foreign intermediaries to persuade <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> not to cut legal and administrative links with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. The decision was a setback for <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>' <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which proposed resolving the dispute with the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> by negotiating with <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> told <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television on Monday that <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> elections here this November `` will determine if the Jordanian option is dead or not.'' Also Monday, the Israeli Peace Now movement appealed to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and three other Western countries to obtain the release of <PERSON> Faisal </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>, a prominent pro-PLO activist jailed Sunday for six months without trial. `` The only chance to make peace is with the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leadership. When one appears, they -LRB- Israeli authorities -RRB- cut him down,'' said Peace Now spokesman <PERSON> Avishai </PERSON> <PERSON> Margalit </PERSON>. Attorney General <PERSON> Yosef </PERSON> <PERSON> Harish </PERSON> decided on Monday to put Jewish settler leader <PERSON> Pinhas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallerstein </PERSON> on trial in the Jan. 11 shooting death of a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television said. According to initial army reports, <PERSON> Wallerstein </PERSON> fired in self-defense after being stoned by Palestinians, but Palestinian witnesses said 17-year-old <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghanem </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammad </PERSON> was killed without provocation.

 <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> City Councilman <PERSON> Hosea </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> was arrested and led away from <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s City Hall in handcuffs Monday on a 5-month-old weapons charge stemming from an incident at Hartsfield airport. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> was held briefly at the jail in neighboring <LOCATION> Clayton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Hartsfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> is located, then released on his own recognizance. His arrest by <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> County Sheriff <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemacks </PERSON> came about two hours after a news conference during which he said he had never been notified of the charges against him. He was indicted last week by a <LOCATION> Clayton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> grand jury on one count of possession of a weapon by a convicted felon. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> was stopped March 6 at a security checkpoint at <ORGANIZATION> Hartsfield </ORGANIZATION> as he tried to board a plane. Police said they found a .38 - caliber handgun and five bullets inside his According to police, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said he had placed the gun in his briefcase while cleaning his car and forgot it was there when he dashed to the airport. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> was given a copy of the charges and allowed to board the plane after his handgun and ammunition were confiscated. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> first was charged with two misdemeanor counts _ carrying a weapon without a license and carrying a concealed weapon. The charges was upgraded to a single felony count after a review of <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' criminal record, said <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuggle </PERSON>, chief of administrative operations for the <ORGANIZATION> Clayton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> If found guilty, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> could face one to five years in jail. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> has been arrested numerous times during his work for civil rights, and also has at least 25 traffic-related convictions. At his news conference, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> denied reports that he had promised to surrender over the weekend. `` The racist white press of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> is again out to destroy my image as a black leader who is unbought and unbossed,'' he said. <PERSON> Tuggle </PERSON> had been quoted over the weekend as saying, `` We have been in contact with Mr. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and he has indicated he will turn himself in.'' <PERSON> Tuggle </PERSON> said Monday that <LOCATION> Clayton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> authorities had contacted <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> indirectly last week through the <ORGANIZATION> Fulton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, and that <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> had told those officers he would handle the matter over the weekend `` He is being truthful when he says he did n't talk directly with us, but he's not being truthful when he says he did n't know anything about it,'' <PERSON> Tuggle </PERSON> said. `` He knew what was going on.''

<TEXT>
 A Soviet official said Monday there is a good chance four-way talks that resume Tuesday will produce a peace settlement soon in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamyshin </PERSON>, Soviet deputy foreign minister, made the comments after two days of consultations with <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistant secretary of state for <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> affairs. <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON> is mediating the talks among <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, which began three months ago and resume Tuesday. Agreement on guidelines for a settlement was reached during last month's round in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` We think there are chances of success in these negotiations,'' <PERSON> Adamyshin </PERSON> told a news conference. `` It appears that all sides are serious about seeking a settlement. ... It is possible that there will be a settlement in the nearest future.'' Asked to be more specific, he said a target date of Sept. 29 had been mentioned. That is the 10th anniversary of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Security Council Resolution 435 on independence for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, also known as <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has controlled since World War I. All negotiators accepted the resolution as a basis of the `` Principles for a Peaceful Settlement in <LOCATION> Southwestern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'' agreed upon July 20. The list of 14 principles, the first document to which the three countries have agreed, link independence for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> to withdrawal of the estimated 50,000 Cuban troops in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. Cuban soldiers have helped the Marxist government against rebels of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>, who have fought since <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> became independent of <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> in 1975. The movement, led by <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>, is supported by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The agreement on principles emerged from three rounds of talks held since May in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Military commanders of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> met in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION> and were said to have made progress on disengaging <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> and South African soldiers who face each other along the <LOCATION> Angola-Namibia </LOCATION> frontier. <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON> has called the list of principles `` an important step'' but says hard bargaining remains. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has assigned a special observer, although it is not a participant in the negotiations. <PERSON> Adamyshin </PERSON> was asked about a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official's statement that the superpowers find increasing common ground on southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, and acknowledged there is `` more understanding.'' He added, however, that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> `` is unlawful and must be stopped. On that point, we differ with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' Later in the news conference, he said the aid issue must be settled between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. It is not covered in the list of principles. According to <PERSON> Adamyshin </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> `` will be satisfied with whatever satisfies <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>.'' <LOCATION> SWAPO </LOCATION>, or the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, has fought a guerrilla war in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> since 1966, when the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> abrogated a League of Nations mandate under which <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> governed the former German colony. It has welcomed the agreement on principles and a <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> spokesman described prospects for a settlement as `` reasonably brighter.'' President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> said last week the parties were on the `` threshhold of a political solution.'' <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has been more cautious. Its government radio said Monday recent Cuban reinforcements and deployment of Angolan and <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> soldiers on the Namibian border `` place a question mark over the real intentions'' of the two governments.

 The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> foreign relations chief was quoted as calling on Monday for maintaining Palestinian rights in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> following King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s decision to cut administrative ties with Palestinians in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaddoumi </PERSON> made his comments Monday at a closed meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, according to other <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The council is the upper branch of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s bicameral legislature, the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kaddoumi </PERSON> praised <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s `` distinguished'' relations with the world's 5 million Palestinians and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and said, `` These relations will remain,'' the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials reported. But they said <PERSON> Kaddoumi </PERSON> emphasized the importance of maintaining `` all the rights acquired by the Palestinian people in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> over the past week suspended <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, half of whose members were Palestinians, and canceled a development plan for the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> to dramatize <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> responsibility for the occupied lands. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials said Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> ordered a muzzle on all public comments by his organization about <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s move until the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> _ the equivalent of a Cabinet _ has time to study it. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s actions appeared to please several of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> members who spoke to reporters. But <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> canceled a trip planned to the <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> capital next week. The trip had never been formally announced. <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> is a lifeline for the 850,000 Palestinians in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, most of whom carry Jordanian passports, use Jordanian money and worship in Jordanian-supported mosques. More than half of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s own people are refugees or immigrants from <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> and the king's action has fueled rumors about a posible loss of some rights. <PERSON> Kaddoumi </PERSON> also was quoted as saying that support for the Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories by some <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> governments was `` below required levels.'' He also accused <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> of undermining the insurrection by sponsoring attacks by <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> dissident factions on <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> refugee camps held by <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> loyalists, <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials reported. `` <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s role in the attacks against Palestinian camps is clear as the sun itself,'' <PERSON> Kaddoumi </PERSON> was quoted as saying. `` If they are really after strategic parity -LRB- with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> -RRB-, they should have dropped their anti-PLO policies, especially during the uprising.'' The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials said <PERSON> Kaddoumi </PERSON> took a swipe at <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s chief spokesman, <PERSON> Bassam </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON>, for publishing a moderately phrased newspaper article urging Arab-Israeli coexistence. `` Political initiatives should not flout the resolutions and declared policy of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Kaddoumi </PERSON> was quoted as saying. `` All personal interpretations or judgments by any of the organization's officials or responsible cadres should adhere to the declared national objectives.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> extended its sessions into Tuesday. It had been scheduled to end its meetings Monday night.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it wants the government to capture expected windfall corporate profits that could reach $ 7 billion during future cuts in production of chemicals that destroy the Earth's protective ozone layer. But the agency said it had not decided how to do that, and one major producer said it doubts that there will be major windfalls as the chemicals _ chlorofluorocarbon or <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> compounds _ are cut back. Under <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s expectations, the shortage of <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> compounds will enable producers to raise prices with no increase in production costs. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> disclosed that it was considering regulations that could require manufacturers to pay fees to the government equal to their extra profits; could require recycling or other controls on manufacturing processes; or could require companies to buy manufacturing rights from the government at auctions open to anyone. The agency announced final adoption of detailed regulations, including production quotas, to carry out last year's treaty obliging major nations to cut <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> production 50 percent by 1998. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> expects enough countries to ratify the treaty for it to take effect next Jan. 1. Eleven nations accounting for two-thirds of world production must ratify; six including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have done so. <PERSON> Eileen </PERSON> <PERSON> Claussen </PERSON>, acting deputy <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> administrator for air programs, said the agency leans toward fees, perhaps supplemented by direct controls, as a way of capturing windfall profits. The president's <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>, on the other hand, favors auctioning the production rights. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s authority to proceed without legislation is cloudy, Ms. <PERSON> Claussen </PERSON> said. An auction, she said, could be administratively unworkable if 10,000 small companies participate. `` If it was judged to be illegal, we would have nothing. We would n't be in compliance with the <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> protocol,'' she said. And she said, `` There's a lot of concern about hoarding,'' in which large companies like auto manufacturers would keep smaller concerns, such as those making plastic foams for furniture cushions, from getting production rights. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> wants to the government to get the increased profits because `` our concern is the incentive producers might have for keeping an existing product in production,'' delaying the switch to environmentally harmless alternatives, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, project officer for the regulations. The largest producer of CFCs, <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said it believed no action was needed to take extra profits away from the producers because they would be small or nonexistent. `` One producer after another is announcing progress with substitutes,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Steed </PERSON>, environmental manager for CFCs for <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION>. Substitution `` is the driving force we're going to see ... if we can fund development at the rate we think we need, we'll be doing well.'' <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said the increase in profits over the 1986 level could range from $ 1.8 billion if user companies rapidly find alternatives to $ 7.2 billion if <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> compounds are kept on the market as long as possible. The <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> treaty binds participating countries to a reduction of 20 percent in <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> production in 1993 and a further 30 percent cut in 1998, all calculated from a 1986 base. The long-lived <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> compounds ascend to the ozone layer 15 to 25 miles high, where since about 1960 they have destroyed about 2.5 percent of the ozone protecting humans from skin cancer from the sun's ultra-violet rays normally blocked by ozone. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> estimates that every percent decrease in ozone results on 43,000 additional skin cancer cases in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Currently there are about 500,000 cases a year. The regulation will prevent about 3.7 million early deaths among people now alive in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or to be born by the year 2075, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> estimated. Financially, `` The impact on the consumer will be very small,'' because <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> use is such a small part of the cost of production, and large price increases will be easily absorbed even if the increase is five - or six-fold, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> said CFCs are widely used as refrigeration fluids, solvents and plastic foam blowing agents. They are banned as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aerosol propellants but still used as propellants abroad. A new car typically contains 2.5 pounds of a CFC compound used as air conditioning fluid, costing about $ 1.50. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s regulations, if triggered by the treaty going into effect, mean that in the 12 months beginning July 1, 1989, the five <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers will be bound by these manufacturing quotas, to the nearest million pounds: <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, 336 million pounds; <ORGANIZATION> Allied-Signal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, 171 million; <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, 86 million; <ORGANIZATION> Kaiser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemicals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, 62 million and <ORGANIZATION> Racon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, 30 million. Similar quotas apply separately to the sum of production plus imports minus exports: <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION>, 308 million pounds, <ORGANIZATION> Allied-Signal </ORGANIZATION>, 163 million; <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION>, 84 million; <PERSON> Kaiser </PERSON>, 61 million; <ORGANIZATION> Racon </ORGANIZATION>, 30 million and 10 companies whose imports totaled almost 13 million pounds. Related compounds called halons used in fire extinguishers will be subject to similar quotas starting in 1992. The companies may transfer these quotas among themselves.

<TEXT>
 A paraplegic in a wheelchair, carrying fireworks and samurai swords, lowered himself on a rope Monday from the <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> and dangled 75 feet above the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> for more than an hour. <PERSON> Ramond </PERSON> <PERSON> Masa </PERSON>, 40, of the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, who called himself `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s No 1 Stuntman,'' claimed he had dangled from the 105-year-old landmark for seven hours. His stunt forced traffic on the bridge to be halted as the morning rush hour began. About 30 officers from the police harbor unit, emergency service officers and ambulance personnel rushed to the bridge, which connects lower <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, after a tugboat operator spotted <PERSON> Masa </PERSON>. He was eventually persuaded to lower himself to the river, where he was guided onto a police launch. <PERSON> Masa </PERSON> said he did it because `` I wanted to inspire these guys -LRB- in wheelchairs -RRB- to get up from the hospital, and do something for their communities and their families.'' He refused medical attention at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Infirmary-Beekman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Downtown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> and was taken to a police station, where he was booked on charges of disorderly conduct, unlawful carrying of a knife, and unlawful dealing with fireworks, according to police spokesman Sgt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON>. <PERSON> Masa </PERSON>, a large man with huge biceps and broad shoulders who also uses the name <PERSON> El-Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhammed </PERSON> <PERSON> El-Ratuli </PERSON>, was given a summons for a Sept. 19 court date and released. The man, whose legs are paralyzed, initially told reporters his name was `` Megaman.'' He handed out red, white and blue business cards that proclaimed, `` Living on the edge is my business _ American No. 1 Stuntmen.'' <PERSON> Masa </PERSON> said he lost the use of his legs when he was shot by a sniper in 1977. He said his dangle off the <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> was his first experience as a stuntman. `` I planned for three months to do something real crazy to get into the Guinness record book,'' he said. After a short vacation, <PERSON> Masa </PERSON> said he plans to `` hang on the Statue of Liberty or the World Trade Center. Maybe I'll take a shot at the Eiffel Tower in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Masa </PERSON> said he was dropped off in the center of the span at about midnight by his brother, whom he refused to identify. Dragging his wheelchair and two nylon bags containing the swords and firecrackers behind him, <PERSON> Masa </PERSON> crawled to the edge of the span, where he tied a nylon cord around his waist, through the wheelchair and secured it to a five-inch thick piece of bridgework. Then, he pushed the wheelchair off the bridge and shimmied down the rope after it. He was noticed by a passing tugboat, which notified police about dawn. `` He had looped it in some way that he could go down the rope sitting in a wheelchair,'' said police Capt. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Plackenmeyer </PERSON>. <PERSON> Masa </PERSON> said he had planned to don a Ninja costume, light the six super M-80's _ the equivalent of about 1 -LCB- sticks of dynamite _ and hold the two samurai swords, each about three feet long, before he jumped into the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. He abandoned that plan after the two nylon bags containing his gear fell into the river during the rescue effort. <PERSON> Masa </PERSON> expressed no remorse over the traffic jam. `` This is <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. They -LRB- the commuters -RRB- like the excitement on Monday morning.''

 <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and four Central American foreign ministers issued a joint declaration Monday calling for peace and democracy in the region but without mentioning <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, however, used a closing news conference to take several verbal swipes at <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista government and to put in a plug for congressional approval of additional aid to the Nicaraguan rebels, known as Contras. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> was not invited to the meeting. The joint communique, issued at the end of a three-hour meeting, was a watered-down version of an earlier declaration drafted shortly after <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s last visit to <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> in late June. <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> said Sunday that <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> had demanded changes in the proposed communique. The initial draft was said to be 10 pages long and to contain a harsh criticism of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> for its failure to live up to a Central American peace agreement signed by it and its four neighbors a year ago. But as issued, the declaration contained only 10 paragraphs, reafirming the respect of the five countries `` for peace, democracy, security, social justice and economic development'' in all of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. While obviously aimed at <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, it did not mention the country by name. The final version also said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the four Central American nations agreed on the need to establish `` authentic democratic governments in the entire region as indispensable for peace.'' It said the five countries `` reafirmed that authentic democracy requires, among other requisites, political pluralism, freedom of association, freedom of the press, an impartial justice system that guarantees due process, an apolitical armed forces, an honest and open electoral system and respect for human and individual rights.'' At a news conference closing their meeting, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said the Contras `` are an important element, expressing a strong desire for freedom and democracy in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and we continue to support them. `` I did n't come here basically to discuss that subject, and we did n't have very much discussion of it, although I certainly hope that we will extend funding for the Contras,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. `` I think it is very important.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said his discussions with the foreign ministers centered on economic development `` and how we might organize ourselves to pursue that more systematically.'' Upon arriving in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> shared common goals of democracy, the rule of law and economic progress. But he acknowledged problems in reaching those objectives. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> spoke with reporters before meeting with Guatemalan President <PERSON> Vinicio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerezo </PERSON> and later with the four foreign ministers. He contrasted what he described as democracy and growing prosperity in the four Central American nations with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, where he said nine years of <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> rule and continuing warfare have virtually destroyed the economy. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has backed the Contras since 1981 in their fight to overthrow the Sandinista government. In <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> was trying to escalate action against his govermment. Speaking at a ceremony marking the ninth anniversary of the Sandinista air force Monday, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said of the meeting: `` We hope that common sense might predominate, because to want to sign a death sentence against <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, because the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants one, would be the equivalent of signing a death sentence against <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` We hope that these -LRB- Central American -RRB- governments might be sufficiently reasonable and pragmatic so as not to fall in the trap that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is laying in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>,'' he added. The meetings in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> were part of <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s quest for a united effort to isolate <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> politically and economically from its Central American neighbors. In a statement distributed to reporters in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> City Sunday, the Honduran government said it found the demand for draft changes by <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> `` incomprehensible'' and `` strange'' and that the softening of its contents were at the insistence of those two countries. Eliminated from the original statement, the Hondurans said, were sections that would have: _ Criticized <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> for not separating its army, known as the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, from the governing political party _ Denounced `` subversion against <ORGANIZATION> democratic </ORGANIZATION> governments'' by <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> _ Called for a regional security system and continued consultation between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the four Central American nations <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Sunday that the original document had been drafted `` mostly ... by the Central American foreign ministers, not by us. Having drafted it, they were not so sure they wanted to issue it.'' President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, who won the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for designing and promoting the peace plan signed last Aug. 7, has promised his own progress report soon and there was speculation that his government decided the <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> declaration might undercut <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>' review. <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, unlike <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, does not share a common border with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and pursues what it calls a policy of `` active neutrality.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> was to fly on to <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> Monday night for his second stop on a 10-day trip that will take him to nine Latin American nations. He will return to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> Aug. 8-9 for meetings with the presidents of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>.

 Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dearden </PERSON>, who led the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> archdiocese of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> for 22 years and was an important voice for church reform, died Monday at the age of 80. <PERSON> Dearden </PERSON> died of pancreatic cancer at <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where he had been hospitalized since July 22. `` This good and holy priest, archbishop and cardinal of the church, will be mourned by Catholics of the Archdiocese of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, this country and throughout the world,'' said Cardinal <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Szoka </PERSON>, the archbishop of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dearden </PERSON>, who headed the archdiocese from 1959 to 1981, voted in the election of two popes and played a major role in the <ORGANIZATION> Second </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which from 1962-65 launched extensive reforms in the church, including departure from the Latin Mass, greater emphasis on laymen's roles and fostering greater unity among all Christians. <PERSON> Dearden </PERSON> retired as archbishop in 1980 after suffering a heart attack but continued to administer the diocese until May 1981, when he was succeeded by <PERSON> Szoka </PERSON>, who was elevated in June to cardinal. <PERSON> Dearden </PERSON> cited health reasons and age for retiring as spiritual leader of the 1.2 million-member archdiocese. He remained active, however, in the <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cardinals </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dearden </PERSON> last was seen in public May 31 at Sacred Heart Seminary in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> for a Mass in honor of his 40th anniversary as a bishop. At the time he looked pale and frail and delivered the sermon from a chair on the altar. `` We give him back to God, secure in our faith that he has been welcomed into the kingdom of our heavenly father. There with <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, the mother of God, and all the apostles in whose footsteps he followed, he will have joy and life forever,'' <PERSON> Szoka </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dearden </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> native, was raised in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. He became a priest in 1932 and served as a bishop in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> before coming to <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. He founded the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION> and was its president from 1966-71. The conference worked to adopt <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> II philosophies in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and currently addresses social, political and economic issues within the context of Christian principles. <PERSON> Dearden </PERSON> was named a cardinal by <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> VI </PERSON> in 1969 and participated in the voting for popes <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> I </PERSON> and II in 1978. <PERSON> Dearden </PERSON> will lie in state at the Cathedral of Most Blessed Sacrament Wednesday until Friday, when burial is scheduled at Holy Sepulcher Cemetery. He is survived by brothers <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> and <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> and a number of nieces and nephews.

 An explosion demolished a dormitory at a British army barracks while the men were sleeping Monday morning, killing one soldier and wounding nine. The <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility. It was the fifth attack attributed to the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> since May on British military targets outside <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Irland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Archie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, the armed forces minister, said after touring the scene: `` It seems very likely it was a bomb. ... This makes it an extremely cowardly attack, if that is what it was, by the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>.'' <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard said police had not determined whether a bomb caused the explosion. British Gas experts said they could find no sign of a gas leak or accidental cause. The blast at 7 a.m. at the <PERSON> Inglis </PERSON> barracks, a military mail depot in suburban <LOCATION> Mill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, knocked down most of the two-story brick dormitory and started a fire. Two men were seriously injured and one was under intensive care, hospital spokesmen said. Soldiers and firefighters dug trapped soldiers out of the debris. One survivor, buried for half an hour, was saved by a radiator that fell across his chest and became a shield. The dead soldier was identified as <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>, 23, a lance corporal in the Royal Engineers. Earlier his last name had been given as <PERSON> Robbin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Inglis </PERSON> is one of hundreds of small, lightly guarded army bases in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the attack raised fears of assaults on others. It is on the edge of <LOCATION> Finchley </LOCATION>, the parliamentary constituency of Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> attacks have taken the lives of 16 British servicemen this year in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and abroad, compared with only three in all of 1987. The apparent objective is to create public outrage that will pressure <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> into leaving <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. An <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> claim of responsibility was delivered to the British domestic news agency <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. The guerrilla movement, most of whose members are <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, is trying to drive the British from the Protestant-dominated province and unite it with the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> promised a security review of military installations in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and abroad. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, where she was on an official visit: `` I have sent a message to say I am very distressed and I anxiously await further news.'' The 15 men living in the dormitory were in bed when the explosion tore out the main floor, an army spokesman said. The building can accommodate 70. `` In the middle it just demolished it like a pack of cards,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> McParland </PERSON>, a construction worker at the barracks. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Inglis </PERSON> housed the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Courier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depot </ORGANIZATION>, with a staff of 250, and personnel from the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and Women's <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>. It was the first fatal attack attributed to the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> in mainland <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> since guerrillas planted a bomb in Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s hotel during a political convention in <LOCATION> Brighton </LOCATION>, south <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, in October 1984. She escaped injury, but five other people were killed. In May, after a 14-month lull, the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> resumed attacks on British military targets in continental <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Three British servicemen have been killed and 12 people wounded in four machine gun and bombing attacks in the three months in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s legal political wing, said last week attacks on British soldiers had `` more value'' _ more impact in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> _ than killing policemen or locally recruited soldiers in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. `` So from that perspective, the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> certainly would like to target more British soldiers,'' he told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Twelve British soldiers have been killed in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> this year. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has had soldiers in the province since sectarian violence began in August 1969. Civilian workers said security was lax at <PERSON> Inglis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Onisiforo </PERSON>, 23, who took over a shop in the barracks four months ago, said she did not even have a security pass for three months. `` Everybody knows there is no security there,'' she said. In its most serious attack on the military in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> killed 11 soldiers and seven of their horses in double bombings of a military band and cavalrymen in two <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> parks in July 1982.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said Monday the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, with `` cramped ideals and limited ambitions,'' has spent huge amounts of money on wasteful projects rather than helping blacks and poor people. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> suggested that if <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is elected, `` all of us may be picking up the pieces.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, in a speech, did not mention by name his expected presidential election rival, Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. But he made it clear he was including the vice president in his criticism of the administration. `` We're going to have a president and a vice president who understand that affirmative action is an essential part of making the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream come true for each and every citizen of our country,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, meanwhile, in remarks prepared for delivery at a fund-raiser for Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, R-Del., took issue with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> _ also without naming him _ for declaring in his nomination acceptance speech that `` the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> era'' is ending `` Does he want to end the era of lower tax rates and higher real income for families, record numbers of jobs, low inflation and interest rates, steady growth and respect, not just lip-service for families?'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> asked. `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> this year has come to a divide in the road,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` Take one fork and we continue in the direction that <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> has helped chart. Take the other, and in four years all of us may be picking up the pieces.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was out of the public eye at the White House Monday, still weighing his choice of a running mate. And <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, whose reception was cordial but unenthusiastic received his only standing ovation when commenting on the vice president's absence from the meeting of the non-partisan group. Aides said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> could n't appear because of a prior commitment. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is to travel to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> on Tuesday for a foreign policy speech, then make a trip to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> later in the week before flying to his home in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, for the weekend. He is to address the Republican platform committee next Monday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, one week before the party opens its national convention in that city. While Democratic senators worked in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to draft a compromise package of new aid to the Nicaraguan rebels, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> reiterated his opposition to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance to the Contras. `` It's a failed and illegal policy and it ought to stop,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said prior to leaving <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` Right now the administration once again seems to be doing everything again to ... destroy the peace process,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. The Democratic nominee said that, in principle, he does not favor humanitarian aid but would accept it if the aid was part of a negotiated settlement and the money was used to resettle the Contras and end the war. Democrats, in working on a new aid package, are trying to defuse an issue that has divided <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who opposes Contra aid, from his running mate, <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, who has consistently supported it. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> insisted he was n't bothered by <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s support of Contra aid. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> spent most of Monday in private meetings in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in preparation for expected action this week on trade and plant-closing notification legislation. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, stepping up his efforts among the nation's black voters who earlier backed <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s presidential bid, said in his speech, `` We have to transform the cycle of poverty into a ladder of opportunity, and that ladder must be sturdy and strong for all our citizens.'' `` Some people say it ca n't be done,'' he said. `` I say we have n't tried.'' Then, using a rhetorical tool often employed by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> accused the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration of spending vast sums of money on bad policies, following each contention with the refrain that at the same time `` we have n't tried'' to help minorities and others. `` Fifteen billion dollars already wasted on Star Wars. We have n't tried,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` Thirty-six billion dollars for two super-carrier task forces we do n't need and ca n't afford. My friends, we have n't tried. `` Hundreds of thousands of wasted lives, and millions of dollars to overthrow the government of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. My friends, we have n't tried `` An annual assault on the opportunity to go to college that has left us with fewer <PERSON> black </PERSON> college students today than we had seven years ago. We have n't tried.'' In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, meanwhile, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who lost the Democratic nomination to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, said Monday he is willing to meet with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> to try and iron out differences dating back to <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>'s strong crticism of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> before <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s April primary. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said, `` If you really believe as I do that it's important to have a Democrat in the White House, you set aside those differences.'' Another former candidate, Republican <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, returned Monday as co-host of his cable network's flagship program, `` The 700 Club''. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> received good news on the homefront before traveling to <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. According to law enforcement sources who spoke only on condition they not be named, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has informed the state that a preliminary inquiry turned up no evidence of law-breaking to support charges that the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> administration leaked confidential information on prison-siting plans to developers who then bought land and offered to sell it to the state. The allegations, lodged by opponents of plans to build a 500-bed state prison in rural <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Braintree </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, had been cited by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> critics to attack the good-government pledges at the center of his presidential campaign. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cloherty </PERSON> refused to characterize the outcome of the inquiry but said no charges had been filed. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> told a federal appeals court that the Democratic ticket should get $ 46 million in matching funds despite a Republican contention that <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was benefiting unfairly. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is also running for re-election to his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat and has raised money for that race.

 Banks and exchange houses closed Monday in the first of two government-ordered bank holidays, but Argentines were kept in suspense about economic measures being prepared. The president of the Union of Argentine Commercial Businesses, <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Arrojo </PERSON>, said the pending changes seem like `` another attempt to transfer resources from the private sector to the public sector.'' The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>, which claims 3 million members, called off a meeting with <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Terragno </PERSON>, minister of public works and services, pending a briefing on the plan. In <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, an opposition <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> deputy, <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Matzkin </PERSON>, complained his party was not consulted on the reforms, and he demanded a `` detailed report'' on negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> regarding <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s $ 55 billion foreign debt. On Sunday, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> announced banks and exchange houses would be closed Monday and Tuesday while the government put the finishing touches on a new, anti-inflationary economic package. No details were disclosed. On Monday, President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> met with Economy Minister <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sourrouille </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Machinea </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Brodersohn </PERSON>. <PERSON> Machinea </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brodersohn </PERSON> returned Sunday from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, where they reportedly negotiated a $ 1.2 billion stand-by loan from the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION>. Reportedly under consideration are wage and price controls, major hikes in bus fares and other public services, taxes on exports, devaluation of the austral, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s currency, and other measures aimed at curtailing triple-digit inflation. The inflation rate stood at 121.2 percent over the past six months, and 321.7 percent over the past 12 months. The cost of living rose 18 percent in June; the July rise has been anticipated at more than 20 percent. The economic overhaul will be <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>'s second since the civilian president replaced a military government in December 1983. In June 1985, with annual inflation at more than 1,000 percent, he imposed a wage and price freeze, placed a cap on government employment and replaced the peso with the austral. In 1986, the inflation rate in the nation of 31 million dropped to its lowest rate in the 1980s when it hit 82 percent. Last year, however, the rate was 175 percent.

 Soldiers killed 14 Shining Path guerrillas in a clash near this highland city, and a military sentry in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> was fatally wounded Monday during a foiled rebel attack, officials said. The military command in <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION>, 225 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, said a fierce firefight between troops and a Maoist guerrilla column last Thursday on the city's isolated northeastern outskirts left 14 rebels dead. The military reported the fighting here Sunday, but news reports could not reach the capital, <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, until Monday because of a <ORGANIZATION> Shining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION> attack last week on power pylons, which cut power supplies and most telephone and microwave transmissions. <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> police said a military sentry at the Factory of Munitions of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> was fatally wounded at dawn Monday by suspected Shining Path guerrillas, who attempted to plant a bomb at a gate.

 Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said Monday he will announce D-Day, a date for a cease-fire in the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq war, after his fact-finding team returns from those countries this week and he consults the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. `` The D-Day does n't depend on the parties,'' the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief said, indicating he could make a unilateral decision and go ahead without the agreement of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> says it is ready to honor an immediate cease-fire. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> made the statement to reporters after a three-hour meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON>. Announcement of a truce date would put pressure on <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to compromise and drop its insistence on direct talks with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> before a cease-fire. No immediate reaction surfaced from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> military team of experts now is in <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, preparing its report, and the team leader will present it to him in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Wednesday. `` I will study his report. I will be in touch with members of the -LRB- Security -RRB- Council and then I will decide on a D-Day,'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said. `` It is very difficult to tell you now,'' he said when asked if he would announce D-Day this week. He cautioned against the idea that a cease-fire could be simply or rapidly implemented. The secretary-general said once D-Day is decided, he will begin consulting nations which could provide about 250 military observers to monitor the cease-fire and troop withdrawal. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief held his sixth meeting with <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> since talks began last week. He has met three times with <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON>, but <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said it was not prepared to enter into substantive talks with <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> until direct talks take place. Iraqi officials also have not responded to a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> report on chemical weapons which concluded that the <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> government has made frequent and large-scale use of the outlawed weapons against Iranian forces. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> and Ambassador <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ja'afar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> told reporters Monday that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> wants the secretary-general to go ahead and name the cease-fire date, with or without <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s agreement. `` <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is immediately ready to implement -LRB- a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peace -RRB- resolution by a cease-fire,'' <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said it was `` theoretically correct'' he could unilaterally announce a cease-fire date, `` but I prefer to wait for my team, be in touch with members of the council and perhaps the parties.'' He said he hoped for `` the shortest possible period'' between the announcement of a D-Day and the beginning of a cease-fire. The war, which began in September 1980, has cost an estimated 1 million lives. In response to questions, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief said that if he or the council declared a cease-fire `` and one side does not respect it... that is for the council to decide. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> told reporters all major issues have been covered in their meetings `` and there is no substantial point -LRB- of disagreement -RRB- between us and the secretary-general.'' <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> also said, `` We think that especially after recent use of chemical weapons ... now the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> should do something against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>.'' The experts' detailed report mentioned nine <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> soldiers poisoned in a battle zone, allegedly in a mustard gas attack by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Other <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> reports have said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> used chemical weapons, which are outlawed under the 1925 <ORGANIZATION> Geneva </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> recently condemned use of the illegal weapons in the war. <PERSON> Sadoun </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, Iraqi minister of state for foreign affairs, earlier Monday repeated his country's insistence on direct talks before a truce during an appearance on state television in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. The 15-member <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> gave unanimous approval July 20, 1987, to Resolution 598, which provides for a cease-fire, withdrawal to recognized borders, prisoner exchange, peace negotiations and an investigation to determine which side started the war in September 1980. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> agreed to accept the resolution soon after it was passed last summer, but <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had refused until two weeks ago, July 18. The chemical weapons report was prepared by two specialist physicians who visited both countries in early July. `` We deeply regret to say that on the basis of evidence gathered and in spite of repeated appeals by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, chemical weapons continue to be used on an intensive scale against Iranian forces,'' it said. `` From the examination of weapon fragements it can be concluded that bombs similar to those used in 1984, 1986 and 1987 have again been used against Iranian forces on Iranian territory, indicating their repeated utilization by Iraqi forces.'' <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has acknowledged using chemical weapons, but claims <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> introduced them to the war.

 Troops killed 18 communist and Moslem secessionist rebels in clashes, military reports said Monday. The military also said vandals damaged the tomb of President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s husband. Maj. <PERSON> Hernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Patawaran </PERSON>, spokesman of the <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, said vandals pried a concrete slab loose on the tomb of assassinated former Sen. <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, but the body was not disturbed. Workers installed steel sheets to protect the body. In <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, Adm. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hays </PERSON>, commander-in-chief of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday that if American bases in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> are lost, there will be `` only one big winner _ the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' But <PERSON> Hays </PERSON> told reporters he was `` bullish about the future of the bases.'' The <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> broke off talks on the bases with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> July 26. Foreign Secretary <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> said differences over <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> compensation for use of the bases were so wide he doubted the talks could be revived. The agreement on <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> and Subic Bay Naval Base expires in 1991. The official <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said troops killed nine communist <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas and wounded three in a three-hour battle Sunday in <LOCATION> Nueva </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vizcaya </LOCATION> province, 130 miles north of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. It said government forces suffered no casualties. The clash occurred one day after marines and militiamen repulsed two separate attacks by Moslem secessionists on <LOCATION> Basilan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jolo </LOCATION> islands, killing nine insurgents. A military report said about 80 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Moro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> tried to storm a marine camp on <LOCATION> Basilan </LOCATION>, 550 miles south of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, but were driven away. Seven rebels were killed, the report said. It did not mention government casualties. Two other Moslem seccessionists were killed and four militiamen were wounded in a clash on on <LOCATION> Jolo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, southwest of <LOCATION> Basilan </LOCATION>, another report said. The Moro front has been fighting for Moslem rule on <LOCATION> Mindanao </LOCATION> and other southern islands since 1972. <PERSON> Patawaran </PERSON> said the vandalism of the Aquino tomb apparently occurred Friday and was discovered Saturday after workers at the <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> Memorial Park cemetery reported receiving a telephone call that a bomb had been planted in the tomb. <PERSON> Patawaran </PERSON> said officials had no idea who desecrated the tomb or why. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> was shot on Aug. 21, 1983, upon returning from three years of self-imposed exile in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. His death fueled opposition to President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, culminating in a civilian-military revolt that unseated <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> in February 1986 and drove him into exile after 20 years in office. The revolt swept Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> into the presidency. <PERSON> Patawaran </PERSON> said workers cemented the slab back after bomb experts found no explosives inside. Soldiers guarded the tomb Monday.

 Teen-agers from an Ozarks town responded with a resounding cheer Monday, and maybe even kicked up their heels a bit, when a federal judge threw out a century-old ban on school dances. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said the ban on school-sponsored dancing in <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> has the effect of promoting religious values, is unconstitutional, and `` must be invalidated.'' `` I thought we'd win,'' said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, 16, who will be student president at the 160-pupil <ORGANIZATION> Purdy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> this fall. `` They -LRB- school board members -RRB- never gave anything concrete, a good reason why we should n't dance.'' The judge stopped short of ordering the school board to schedule a dance. Miss <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> said she would try to organize a school-year opening dance. Residents of <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON>, about 60 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, say the ban could be 100 years old. The rule states: ` School dances are not authorized and school premises shall not be used for purposes of conducting a dance.'' The judge, in his ruling, said, `` Even if the defendants could show a valid secular purpose, the primary effect of this rule is to endorse the tenets of that particular religious group in <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> who believe that social dancing is sinful.'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> awarded the plaintiffs in the 1986 civil suit nearly everything the 21 students and their parents asked for: $ 1 in nominal damages, attorney fees and an order that the school board stop enforcing its ban on dancing. About 20 teens and a few parents drove to the courthouse in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> to hear the judge's decision from their attorney, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleischaker </PERSON>. `` I hope at this point they -LRB- school board members -RRB- will sit down with the students and they will come up with a plan to have a dance,'' <PERSON> Fleischaker </PERSON> said. `` I think if they do n't start being reasonable, they're likely to be dealt with harshly in the future. We could theoretically end up back in court asking enforcement of the decision.'' School board member <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Negre </PERSON> said he had not been advised of <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>'s ruling and had no comment. Repeated attempts to reach the other school board members by phone were unsuccessful and Superintendent <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Buxton </PERSON> was reported to be out of the state. <PERSON> Ransom </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, an attorney for the school board, said the court's conclusions that the board was motivated by religious reasons `` in our viewpoint was not correct,'' but no decision on an appeal had been made. `` We're deeply disappointed in the court's decision,'' <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> said. `` In our view we do not believe the board acted in an unconstitutional manner. They were reacting to the community viewpoint, which they as elected officials were obligated to do.'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> called `` unpersuasive'' the testimony of school board members during a four-day hearing in June that they did not know why the community opposed dancing, but felt the ban was the will of the majority. `` This court is skeptical that it heard the complete story concerning the board members' deliberations of the rule and the religious significance of the opposition to dancing in <LOCATION> Purdy </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> wrote. Although dances were banned on school property, dances have been held at a community center in the town, and <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> students have organized junior-senior proms and held them in neighboring communities. The controversy escalated after the class of 1986 failed to persuade the school board to drop the ban, and dance supporters held a rally like the one in the movie, `` Footloose,'' about a fictional <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> town where dancing was banned.

<HEAD>Two Studios Offer To Pay Union Fines For Returning Writers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Two film studios said Monday they will pay any union fines incurred by striking scriptwriters who return to work while the union's 22-week strike continues. But a dissident group of writers, which has threatened strike-breaking in the past, announced at the same time that it would continue to honor the Writers Guild of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> walkout. On Sunday, the contract talks were declared `` hopelessly deadlocked'' by <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Counter </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION>. He added that it was expected some union members would ignore guild warnings and return to work. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Katzenberg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Diller </PERSON>, the respective heads of <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> and 20th Century <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, said that their studios will compensate union members who return to work in violation of union orders. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Binkow </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, confirmed <PERSON> Diller </PERSON>'s offer. <PERSON> Katzenberg </PERSON>'s proposal was reported in Tuesday's editions of The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. Union fines against strike-breaking writers are set at 110 percent of all payment received for unauthorized strike work, said union spokeswoman <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON>. Furthermore, violators are subject to lifetime expulsion from the guild, <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> said that she knew of no movement within union ranks to accept the indemnification proposal. `` It remains to be seen if any writers will be interested in such protection or pseudo-protection,'' <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> said. Among those who have been expected to resign from the guild are members of the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, 21 writers who have pushed for a strike settlement under contract terms that union members have strongly opposed. The coalition, after a four-hour strategy conference Monday, announced that it would remain with the guild. The group was apparently encouraged by a discussion with <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION> West and the guild's chief negotiator. The coalition had threatened to leave the guild on July 28 but changed its plans last week when negotiations appeared to be making progress. The strike by more than 9,000 union members began March 7. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> said on a recorded union hot line message Monday that he hoped all members `` will decline -LRB- the -RRB- invitation'' to write during the strike. <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> said, too, that the <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION> has asked the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> not to grant work visas to foreign writers coming to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to write for <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> production companies during the strike. `` Indemnification is a matter for discussion between each studio and a specific writers,'' <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, a spokesman for the producers alliance, said Monday. `` -LRB- Indemnification -RRB- is not an alliance function.'' <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> said that any indemnification payments would be seen by the union as compensation and therefore subject to further fines. `` The production companies are not concerned about the writers,'' <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> said. `` They are looking for their own short-term gain. One writing assignment is not worth a whole career. And people do not forget when people cross a picket line in the middle of a strike.'' The union has so far handed out more than $ 2 million in hardship loans to its finacially strapped members, <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, the union was optimistic that contract talks with the producers might resume, and placed the blame for last weekend's negoatiating collapse on the alliance `` We are doing all that we can to continue the negotiating process,'' <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> said on the union's hot line message. `` It's regrettable that the alliance has no such commitment to the industry. The producers have insisted that the union is making unreasonable demands and repeatedly refuses to make any contract compromises.

 Gusty wind fanned fires in Yellowstone National Park to greater size Monday, and hundreds of firefighters were sent to the fire lines in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> in a drive to contain a week-old fire in rugged terrain. Fires also burned in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. More than 125,500 acres had been burned in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, the oldest national park. High wind Sunday, and again on Monday, combined with backburning intended to stop the blazes, spread the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fork </LOCATION> fire about four miles west of the Old Faithful geyser complex from 11,300 acres to 12,700 in 24 hours, said fire information officer <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> LaOrange </PERSON>. About 360 firefighters were sent out Monday to re-establish fire lines along the southern and eastern edges of the fire where the wind pushed flames over fire breaks, said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Blade </PERSON>, another fire information officer. Also jumping substantially in size was the Fan fire in the park's northwestern corner, from 7,500 acres to roughly 11,600, said <PERSON> LaOrange </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Lewis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> or Red fire near <LOCATION> Grant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> covered 12,700 acres Monday and the nearby Shoshone fire had blackened 13,100 acres, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Wyoming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> opened a hot line Monday to answer tourists' questions about the fire at <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>. `` The forest fires have certainly gained us national attention, but we are concerned that tourists planning to visit <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Cowboy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> may change their plans,'' said commission director <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>. East of <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> Bighorn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, about 500 firefighters returned to work Monday in a drive to control two fires covering an estimated 2,550 acres. Fire bosses in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> used more than 1,150 firefighters to contain the 5,000-acre <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gulch </PERSON> fire in central <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, which officials have determined was started by a cigarette. Most of the work in the rocky terrain had to be done by hand, said <ORGANIZATION> Boise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawthorne </PERSON> said. `` The country is so steep and rugged, bulldozers can only do so much,'' she said. The seven-day-old blaze about 35 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION> had destroyed $ 7.5 million worth of timber and other resources and cost over $ 1 million to fight. Elsewhere in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, some 200 firefighters reached 90 percent containment of the 110-acre <LOCATION> Riordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> fire, burning in heavy timber in a remote roadless area near Cascade. Fire bosses expected full containment by Tuesday evening. In southwestern <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, firefighters closed roads into the <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Como </LOCATION> area Monday and shut down its recreational facilities as they drove to complete lines around the <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> fire, which had burned 3,200 acres of the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness and the <ORGANIZATION> Bitterroot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> since July 22. Forest information officer <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnier </PERSON> said 682 firefighters had completed lines around 90 percent of the fire. A <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> man accused of starting that fire appeared in court Monday on a misdemeanor charge of allowing a camp fire to escape, <PERSON> Barnier </PERSON> said. Low temperatures and high humidity helped efforts to contain three fires burning in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, said <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officials. The largest, the 3,600-acre <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> fire, was 90 percent contained, said <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Albert </PERSON>. A 55-acre fire on the Olympic Peninsula near <LOCATION> Hoquiam </LOCATION> was under control and firefighters had almost suppressed a 75-acre blaze near <LOCATION> Skykomish </LOCATION>, officials said. High wind Monday morning in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> hampered efforts to contain an 145-acre fire in the <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, but spokeswoman <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Cottrell </PERSON> said a line had been built around 95 percent of the fire. She said firefighters expect to have it contained by Tuesday. A three-mile section of a <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> road was closed as officials expressed concern for the safety of mountain bikers who had been seen in the vicinity, <PERSON> Cottrell </PERSON> said. In southern <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, firefighters contained nearly 90 small blazes Sunday on private and public lands. In northern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, a crew battled a 400-acre fire, said <ORGANIZATION> Interagency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> dispatcher <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>.

 A pretrial hearing Monday for the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supply </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> bond default trial dealt with such matters as witness testimony by satellite, jury size and selection and juror notebooks. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> also said he will take up on Friday a defense motion asking him to order the plaintiffs to drop assertions of conspiracy or to delay the Sept. 7 trial at least 60 days. The 1983 <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> default is the largest in municipal bond history, on $ 2.25 billion in bonds it sold to finance construction of two nuclear power plants in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state. Plaintiffs include more than 24,000 bondholders who have filed proofs of claim and <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, the trustee representing bondholders. The bondholders, suing as a class action, are alleging fraud, negligence and conspiracy, said attorney <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>, chairman of a lawyers' group representing the purchasers. They are seeking more than $ 1 billion in damages. <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> is seeking $ 7 billion for the value of the bonds plus interest. The case, which is expected to last at least a year, shapes up as being of epic proportions, reputedly one of the biggest securities cases ever. Ten groups representing 50 defendants remain from 104 initially named that included the Power Supply System, various officers and 88 utilities that participated in construction of the abandoned power plants. The federal <ORGANIZATION> Bonneville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and others, including bond and special counsel to <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION>, engineers, bond underwriters, financial consultants and architects, also were named initially. But <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> has ruled that Bonneville can not be sued, and last year underwriters reached a tentative agreement that would let them out for $ 92 million. <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, acting as <PERSON> Browning </PERSON>'s settlement master, said Monday that settlements amounting to $ 100,570,000 have been approved by the judge to date, with others worth another $ 170 million pending. The pretrial conference was to resume Tuesday. <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> issued an order July 14 allowing the plaintiffs to pursue certain conspiracy allegations. But defense lawyers, in a postponement motion filed Friday by attorney <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickles </PERSON>, said the judge noted in his order that the plaintiffs `` had not indicated their intention to pursue their conspiracy allegations'' before March _ five years after the litigation began. The trial was moved from <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> because of concern over the ability to select an impartial jury in the <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>, where the case has received extensive publicity and where utility customers' rates stand to be affected by the outcome of the case.

 Waiters, cashiers and others with little control over demanding jobs face an added heart attack risk about as big as that from smoking or high cholesterol, a study of nearly 5,000 men suggests. The study found that male workers in the top 10 percent for such `` job strain'' had 3.8 to 4.8 times the heart attack risk of men in the bottom 10 percent. A second analysis found that men in the top 20 percent for job strain, a list that included cooks, gas station attendants and firemen, had 2.5 to 3.3 times the risk of the rest of the workers studied. Each analysis gave two numbers because it was performed on two groups of men.

But because it was a test, the launch director bypassed the problem to gather as much data and experience as possible from the first such rehearsal since the Challenger disaster 2 -LCB- years ago. `` The launch team did a superb job on the wet countdown demonstration test and accomplished most of the objectives,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Crippen </PERSON>, deputy director of shuttle operations. Objectives missed during the `` wet'' test, in which the liquid propellants were pumped to the shuttle's tanks, will be sought during a second countdown leading to the 20-second firing of Discovery's three main engines on the launch pad. Launch director <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Sieck </PERSON> said a firm schedule for the test-firing would not be set until at least Tuesday, after technicians have had a chance to trace the source of the latest leak, in a launch pad service mast.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> endorsed a compromise bill Monday that would give the federal government its first significant power to combat housing discrimination against minorities, women, the handicapped and families with children. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to `` pass the bill swiftly'' so he could sign `` the landmark civil rights bill for which we have worked so long and hard.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> debated amendments to the legislation Monday, but decided a final vote would not be taken until Tuesday. Major civil rights organizations have given the bill a high priority because the original Fair Housing Act of 1968 contained weak enforcement provisions. The compromise bill includes not only strong enforcement provisions but would expand protection to the handicapped and families with children for the first time.

 <PERSON> Copenhill </PERSON>, a vine-covered slope with a nice view of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, is popular with people who cut swaths through <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. In 1864, Gen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> camped there during the battle for <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> before he burned the city and began his ruinous march to the sea. In the late 1960s, there was a plan to build a road through the area, and the state condemned and destroyed hundreds of homes to make way for it before the project was dropped. The Carter Presidential Center occupies it now and wants to build a road linking the complex to downtown <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. But the right-of-way sits empty and overgrown as neighborhood groups continue a battle over whether the road should be built. At one point, when construction started, workers shook protesters from trees. Today the fight is quieter. Court action has stopped construction since mid-1986. Opponents of the `` Ex-Pres. - Way,'' as they call it, have been in court for years saying the noise, fumes and road-widening would damage historic parks and neighborhoods including some designed by pioneer urban landscaper <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> The road also would slice through a public golf course. Road advocates argue the road was part of the presidential center package, that no more homes would be leveled, that it is needed for safety reasons and would lessen traffic through the older neighborhoods. They say the project would leave some <PERSON> Olmstead </PERSON> parks untouched and trim two only slightly. They note that court decisions have agreed with the need and with the environmental impact statements they have filed. Road opponents are awaiting word on whether the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> will hear their appeal. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON>, lawyer for former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> who also does work for the center, said that without the road part of the <ORGANIZATION> Carter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> could be reclaimed because the center got the use of 27 of the 30 acres of the library site from the state with the understanding that the road would be built. The argument has been used since the controversy began. `` It was n't true then and it's not true now,'' countered R.M. <PERSON> Ossoff </PERSON>, a leader of the anti-road movement. He said elected officials from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senators to city councilmen are overwhelmingly in favor of the <ORGANIZATION> Carter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> but that political support for the road is dropping. `` Demonstrate to me how that much assembled influence could not resolve in three seconds any problems the Presidential Center might have,'' he said. The center already has landscaped the 27 acres at a cost of about $ 4 million. The road was meant to facilitate access to the Carter Presidential Center near downtown <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, and when <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> proposed the library he all but made the road a condition of the center being in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. Opponents of the proposed 2.2-mile Presidential Parkway say traffic through the area is short of predictions and that a smoothly operating <ORGANIZATION> Carter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> belies the claim that the center needs the road to function. Plans call for the four-lane road to have hiking trails, bike paths and other park facilities alongside it, and proponents say it actually will enhance the area. <PERSON> Olmstead </PERSON> designed <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s Central Park, the grounds of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capitol </ORGANIZATION>, the `` Emerald Necklace'' of parks around <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. In the 1890s he designed five parks in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. A 1985 bill requiring the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to make recommendations for preserving <PERSON> Olmstead </PERSON>'s work passed the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> but died in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. In 1984 the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preservation </ORGANIZATION> voted 12-4 against building the road Yard signs flourish near the proposed road: `` Save, Do n't Pave,'' `` Stop the Road'' and `` Build it in Plains'' _ the latter referring to <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s hometown of Plains, <LOCATION> Ga </LOCATION> There have been attempts to put a road through the area for 20 years, and the state condemned land and destroyed over 500 houses and businesses with that in mind in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Then, largely because of opposition from then-Gov. <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, the plan died. The initial proposal for the Presidential Parkway was based heavily on a projected traffic increase of more than 200 percent over 20 years, but road opponents say the actual increase has been closer to 10 percent. Carter Center officials predicted 1.2 million visitors a year would come to the center. The total for the first year was about 175,000. `` Not one presidential library in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is on a four-lane road and there is not any reason to believe that the <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> <PERSON> Library </PERSON> is going to draw any more visitors than the <LOCATION> JFK </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Library </LOCATION> or the <ORGANIZATION> LBJ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION>,'' opposition leader <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorn </PERSON> said at the height of the controversy. Neighborhood citizens groups formed CAUTION -LRB- Citizens Against Unnecessary Thoroughfares In Older Neighborboods -RRB- in early 1982 to coordinate the protest efforts. <PERSON> Ossoff </PERSON>, the first president of CAUTION, says the group has spent more than $ 400,000 in legal fees and that donated legal services have come to far more than that. <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON> said road proponents have spent at least that much. <PERSON> Ossoff </PERSON> says the projected cost of the road has gone up from its original $ 22 million to as high as $ 47 million, would use all of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s federal highway fund allotment for years and would be among the most expensive highways per mile ever built in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. He said political support for the road seems to be on the wane with fewer <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> members backing it and with <PERSON> Maynard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Lomax </PERSON>, the two front-runners for mayor in the 1989 elections, on record as opposing it. `` We need not revisit these issues,'' <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON> said, saying that if the controversy were to start anew every time political opinion changed, `` we would not get anything done.''

<HEAD>Setting Fires `An Ozark Tradition' for Some, Investigator Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A split, charred tree stump is a clue that lightning was to blame for a forest fire. Carbon particles indicate the exhaust of a passing truck was the culprit. And there are other ways to tell a fire was accidental. `` You eliminate all those causes, you're down to arson,'' said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Smallwood </PERSON>, a criminal investigator for <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Mark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Twain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. He comes down to arson in most of his investigations _ and he and other forest officials believe the problem is often rooted in some regional traditions that are as hard to quell as flames. A psychologist's study found economic and even aesthetic reasons why some people light woods aflame. Arsonists set 172 of the 296 <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Twain </PERSON> fires that have broken out so far this year, burning more than 9,000 acres, <PERSON> Smallwood </PERSON> said. A total of 14,200 acres of the forest, which covers 1.5 million acres mostly in southern <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, were burned during a spring fire season made more volatile by drought. On average, <PERSON> Smallwood </PERSON> estimates, 70 percent of the forest fires each year in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> are deliberately set. `` It's probably 90 percent higher than the national average,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Twain </PERSON>'s fire control officer. He said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Twain </PERSON> consistently is among the five forest districts with the worst arson problem. `` It's just been an Ozark tradition of incendiary -LRB- deliberately set -RRB- fires,'' <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> said. The tradition seems to stretch across the southern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Smallwood </PERSON>. Fires in other areas are more likely to be caused by lightning or man's carelessness. As one of the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s 125 special law enforcement agents, <PERSON> Smallwood </PERSON> has spent most of the past 16 years investigating fires in the forests he loves. `` I consider myself an Ozark hillbilly,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is charged with protecting wildlands, and balancing recreational needs with commercial interests in timber and mineral resources. <PERSON> Smallwood </PERSON>'s job includes investigating marijuana growing in the forest, timber theft and theft of other federal property. His military-neat office at the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Rolla </LOCATION> is decorated with game bird feathers, a picture of <PERSON> Smokey </PERSON> <PERSON> Bear </PERSON> and a glass-doored bookcase lined with reports and text books. The <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has called on psychologists, sociologists and archaeologists to determine why fires are set. `` Part of it is tradition,'' <PERSON> Smallwood </PERSON> said. `` In the springtime, people used to burn the woods to allow grass to grow.'' A policy of open grazing, with cattle free to feed on any unfenced land, was allowed in the Ozarks until the 1960s, longer than in other wooded areas, <PERSON> Smallwood </PERSON> said. Psychologist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shea </PERSON> in the 1940s conducted one of the first <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> studies of arson. Subsistence farmers in the rural South who were interviewed by <PERSON> Shea </PERSON> and his researchers claimed fire helped control ticks, snakes and disease and controlled the encroachment of trees on land where they wanted to graze cattle. `` Their ways are those of frontiersmen living in an arrested frontier,'' <PERSON> Shea </PERSON> wrote. Aesthetics even played a part: <LOCATION> Shea </LOCATION> and other researchers found that people living in areas where arson was common enjoyed the smell of smoke in the spring air, and believed the woods looked better `` burned clean.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has attempted to counter the lore that can lead to burning. Over the years, timber has been touted as a cash crop that is as worthy of protection as grassland. <PERSON> Smokey </PERSON> <PERSON> Bear </PERSON> and other programs encourage the view of the forests as a priceless national resource. But the tradition of using fire to manage the woods dies hard. `` There's no cut-and-dried way to prevent it,'' <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> said. `` We had one case -LRB- in 1984 -RRB- where two men went to Sunday school and after school they started a fire with their Sunday school literature,'' <PERSON> Smallwood </PERSON> said. `` They just happened to be driving through an area they thought needed to be burned out.'' Still, the arsonist does not always fit the profile of a simply misguided citizen. `` Part of the problem is people driving around drinking and shooting road signs,'' <PERSON> Smallwood </PERSON> said. `` When they get bored with that, they set fires. It's malicious mischief. `` Sometimes you hear that someone is angry at the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> because of some administrative action _ because we closed a road or disallowed something. And they do n't necessarily have to be mad at the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. They could be mad at government, period.'' Then, `` fire is used as retaliation.'' `` It's so senseless,'' he said. `` It just costs a lot of money to put these fires out and it's coming right out of our tax dollars.'' <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, who oversees about 125 <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Twain </PERSON> employees trained as firefighters, said forest fires cost $ 25 to $ 30 an acre to suppress. In the rare case of a conviction, the arsonist is likely to be put on probation or ordered to pay the costs of fighting the fire and replacing timber that was destroyed, <PERSON> Smallwood </PERSON> said. Last year, a judge ordered two arsonists to work weekends for the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` An arson case in the forest is very hard to make,'' he said. `` When you go out in the middle of the forest to a blackened area to begin an investigation, it's very difficult and frustrating. No. 1, you usually do n't have any witnesses.'' He noted that in some cases, people who have evidence withhold it for fear of being burned out themselves. Beyond the cost in dollars of forest fires, there's risk to those who fight them. `` We had an employee die of a heart attack fighting an arson fire,'' <PERSON> Smallwood </PERSON> said, referring to a 1976 blaze. `` We would have liked to have prosecuted someone in that case. And I would have also liked to have known if the prosecutor would have considered a manslaughter charge against the arsonist.''

 As developments change the the way people communicate _ from cellular phones to interactive cable TV _ some regulators and lawmakers say the Constitution's protections of traditional speech and press need to be restated for the new media. Police can legally eavesdrop on cellular telephone conversations, even though it would be unlawful to tap the same conversations over regular phone lines without a court order, said <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> communication studies Professor <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>. It's also legal to spy on the phone numbers dialed up by a home computer. And here in <LOCATION> Cerritos </LOCATION>, people are frustrated by another constititional quandary. They ca n't receive a futuristic cable system that would provide at-home shopping and banking, not to mention lots of television channels, until it's determined who has a right to install it. `` We are going to have to figure out a way to ensure the First Amendment survives the technological revolution,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> public affairs director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON>. In the <LOCATION> Cerritos </LOCATION> case, an official of the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> _ which regulates broadcast media and some telephone services but not newspapers and magazines _ recently approved the laying of cable by the local telephone company, <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION>, which won a contract from the city last year. But cable industry groups have asked the full <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> to review the matter and a decision is expected in the fall, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The industry cites federal regulations banning telephone companies from operating cable TV in cities where they run the phones. `` The residents are frustrated,'' said <PERSON> Michele </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogle </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for this upscale <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> suburb. `` They would like to see cable television. The surrounding communities have it.'' Some media experts are concerned for a different reason. They think the First Amendment, guaranteeing free speech and press, should keep local and federal governments from deciding who sends or receives information by the new media. `` The phone companies, like any other citizen, enjoy a First Amendment right to be speakers,'' said <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Maines </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> Cable television should have `` little or no regulation at the federal or local level,'' he said. <PERSON> Maines </PERSON>' institute houses the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amendment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION>, which has filed legal briefs and comments with courts and the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> in eight cases it feels threaten the First Amendment rights of new media such as cable television, telephone information services and electronic publishing. Cole of <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> compared the state of law and the new media to `` the <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> where there's no established law and order, anything goes, and the biggest guy with the most power always wins.'' Some argue that the First Amendment is meant to ensure many media voices and that government rules encouraging competition among new media help meet that goal, he said. Letting telephone companies offer electronic information on their wires could give them an unfair advantage over potential competitors, according to former <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> general counsel <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Geller </PERSON>, now head of the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>. `` I do n't want the phone company to be in cable television and control 50 channels,'' <PERSON> Geller </PERSON> said. Future fiber optic transmission lines, which <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> would test in <LOCATION> Cerritos </LOCATION>, could become a `` highway into the home'' carrying telephone, television, and text messages, he said. Today's new media blur the lines between categories lawmakers and judges have used for years. The First Amendment was written more than 200 years ago, when print was the only mass medium. The nation's communication act was passed in 1934, when radio and telephone concerns dominated. `` It used to be easy to tell the difference between newspapers and telephones. Now it's not so easy,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s Kamp. Some newspapers send electronic copies of stories to home computers over phone lines. `` I see no difference between the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> I pick up at my doorstep and the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> that comes in on my computer modem, except that I do n't get newsprint ink on my hands,'' said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a group of 650 companies `` that see information as their product.'' `` They -LRB- new media -RRB- should have the same protections that the First Amendment provides other information sources,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>. But he cited cases `` where information that is put in a new media suddenly loses all of its -LRB- First Amendment -RRB- protections.'' <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s Legislature this year considered a state constitutional amendment extending state free speech and press protections to computer communications. The bill passed the state Assembly but was stalled in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> after law enforcement and credit information companies voiced opposition, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON>, a consultant to the Assembly committee. `` I think the likelihood of all forms of communication having full First Amendment rights is the most likely course over time,'' said <PERSON> Everette </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` It may take a long time to happen. But it's an inevitability.''

<HEAD>Do Cassandras Mismeasure the Economy?</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on financial wires.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy is now in its 69th month of expansion, and according to a very popular view, three score and ten is time sufficient _ meaning the expansion should now roll over and die It is not a foolish concept, since aging expansions in years past have always developed deteriorations similar to the organic, muscular and osteo problems of human old age. But the concept is perhaps overly simple. The average post-war economic expansion has averaged 45 months, and ever since that average was surpassed two years ago the number of Cassandras has grown. They view further growth as bad, a recession as welcome. The reasoning is this: Factories are operating at near capacity and can not produce more; unemployment is down to the scraping-the-bottom level, and that means job openings can be filled only with less productive workers. Such measurements in the past have preceded inflation. Thus, a recession is inevitable, and the sooner the better, the pessimists argue. But some elements do n't seem to fit. `` Growth need n't be inflationary if it is based on solid productivity gains,'' says <PERSON> Prudential-Bache </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON>, who believes some notions about economic expansions, rather than expansion itself, might be dated. Whereas the Cassandras fear that further growth will put too much stress on the system, <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON> and some others observe that growth is what's needed to narrow the federal deficit. But what about the tight job market, ask the pessimists? To which those of more positive mind respond by calling attention to the billions of dollars industry is spending on more efficient plants and equipment, thus reducing the stress. In fact, economists of a positive bent point out, not all price increases are inflationary. Why, they remind us, a price increase accompanied by a bigger rise in product quality can actually be anti-inflationary. Surprised by the persistence of economic expansion in spite of their dire forecasts, some economists are now reviewing their basic notions. They concede there is no better proof or disproof than the economy itself. Incredibly, one factor that could explain the negativism is the neglect of the newer, service sector of the economy, while stressing the older industrial segment. Three-quarters of employment, 67 percent of gross national product and 90 percent of new jobs are in the service sector. Nevertheless, they figure less strongly in most analyses than do older industrial measurements. <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Layton </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> suggest that studies of the service sector do not always fit into neatly constructed concepts of what the economy should be doing. In short, there might be a built-in bias toward using industrial rather than service indicators. They contend that `` one reason for this is that many of the service industries have continued to grow during business cycle contractions as well as expansions.'' Therefore, `` indicators that skip recessions do not get a good rating, and hence tend to be rejected.'' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Layton </PERSON> have developed service indicators for the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, financed by the <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>. The first quarterly report has just been issued. In that report, economist <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON> analyzed the data and concluded there will be continued expansion in the service sector but at a somewhat slackened pace than had been so earlier in the expansion. His conclusion: `` Service-sector economic activity is continuing to expand nicely, but goods-sector activity is now driving the economy. `` The pace of services economics has softened compared with 1987, but does not pose any difficulty for the overall economy or job growth at this time.''

<HEAD>Woman's `Counterclockwise' Journey from Ad Exec to Counselor of
Poor</HEAD>

 <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> is a long way from <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> but <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> Troy </PERSON> has made what she calls the `` counterclockwise'' passage, choosing sacrifice among the poor over affluence in the ad game. Ten years after she left <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> for the big city, Troy had risen to a $ 42,000-a-year job as creative supervisor of a large <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> advertising agency. She gave it up, and now, at 35, is executive director of <ORGANIZATION> Emmaus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a work and counseling program for about 50 formerly homeless people in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION>. She lives and works with them, subsisting on the same $ 25-a-week allowance that they receive. In a neighborhood where gunfire keeps her indoors at night, Troy spends much of her day running up and down stairs. Among walls hung with pictures of the Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the pale, slight redhead deals with everything from buying bathroom mirrors and supervising food deliveries to finding a new drug counselor. In the 18 months she's lived at <LOCATION> Emmaus </LOCATION>, Troy has come to miss her old neighborhood, her privacy and sometimes her old career. She misses shopping and seeing her friends. `` The little things can become a real big treat now, like getting together with a friend at a restaurant,'' she said. `` I enjoyed the freedom of being able to buy what I wanted. ... `` But it's also a freedom in saying ` OK, I think I have enough.''' Three years ago, <PERSON> Troy </PERSON> lost a friend to AIDS. Searching for a way to cope, she returned to church after a long break from her Lutheran upbringing. In a sermon one day at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> on East 16th Street, the priest discussed a man who established missions for the poor and an integrated <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> church in the 19th century. The man, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyng </PERSON>, was Troy's great-great-great-grandfather. Her astonishment at the coincidence of hearing about her forebear in that church and her amazement at the breadth of his accomplishments sparked a change in her. As she sat there, she says, `` my eyes were opened to faith.'' `` Most people do n't need a religious experience,'' she said, `` but I guess I needed it to get my attention.'' <PERSON> Troy </PERSON> began to spend her free time helping with mostly administrative chores at a low-income housing construction project on <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s Lower East Side. After a month, they offered her a job as assistant director, at a pay cut of more than 50 percent from her advertising job. She accepted. Turning to the church had `` started my thinking going counterclockwise to where it had been,'' she said. `` It did n't seem like being competitive and making more money was really the thing to put my time on anymore. ... I just started to think ` if I'm going to work this hard, maybe I could work this hard on something that would really help people.' Father <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> founded <LOCATION> Emmaus </LOCATION> in 1966; two years ago it moved from a brownstone to what had been a hotel notorious for prostitution and drug-dealing. Arsonists gutted the building twice before <LOCATION> Emmaus </LOCATION> could move in. Now, <PERSON> Troy </PERSON> says, the dealers and prostitutes join the 250 people fed in <LOCATION> Emmaus </LOCATION>' soup kitchen each weekday. <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> talks of how much simpler and quieter life at <LOCATION> Emmaus </LOCATION> used to be, before homelessness and poverty intensified, before the advent of crack cocaine. For a woman reared in a small town near <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Emmaus </LOCATION> was full of revelations, despite what Troy already knew of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. A drug addict would come to her room for a friendly chat _ and leave with her watch. She felt betrayed until she sought guidance from a drug counselor, who taught her to look beyond the lies and manipulative behavior into the pain of a person bent only on getting their next fix. When people go to serve the poor, says Troy, they're full of romantic visions _ of rescuing lives, of finding a reward in grateful faces. They soon learn that the changes take longer, that successes are relative and that helpers, like those being helped, are only human. `` If you try to live according to that dream,'' <PERSON> Troy </PERSON> said, `` you get disappointed in yourself and in the others real fast.'' This spring, after six weeks of daily struggles to get out of bed, she recognized signs of the burnout that had hit her predecessor. She left for two weeks at a farm and <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> retreat in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, where people are trained to work with the poor and counseling is given to those who already do. On arrival they took one look at her tired face and put her in the infirmary. A month or so later, Troy looks weary again. She says she rarely thinks about returning to advertising, just occasionally when in a `` snit.'' But she wo n't try to predict where she might be 10 years from now. `` Ten years ago,'' she says, `` I never would have dreamed I'd be here.'' Though she stays in touch with her family and though her devoutly religious mother, in particular, supports what she does, one of the hardest adjustments to life at <LOCATION> Emmaus </LOCATION> was losing touch with her friends. Emergencies _ from a resident who's upset to a potential knife-fight in the soup kitchen _ often interfere with <PERSON> Troy </PERSON>'s outside plans, and her friends are reluctant to visit in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> When they do get together, there are awkward first moments until they find themselves, once more, on equal ground. `` I guess there's something kind of odd,'' <PERSON> Troy </PERSON> said, `` about this friend who leaves it all to go to work with the poor'' and who becomes devout. But as she sees it, there can be as much stress in her old world as she has now. At <LOCATION> Emmaus </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Troy </PERSON> said, her religious conviction has been strengthened: `` There's so much that's beyond my ken or control, or anybody's ability to help.'' She turned to Roman Catholicism in October 1986, drawn by the church's devotion to the <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> and the accessibility of its weekday services. But her faith in human nature has suffered. `` I see the devastation that's happening with these people,'' she said, `` and I see on the other side people who are begrudging even giving out that dime to somebody begging. ... I really see that the problem is far more severe than I had ever thought.'' `` Then,'' she said, `` I have to turn to the individual for my hope.''

<HEAD>Congress Works To Save Last Free Stretch Of Columbia River</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ON THE COLUMBIA RIVER, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> rolls lazily through the desert of central <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, nourishing crops and wildlife in what otherwise would be a wasteland of sagebrush and barren hills. The river, which once roared through deep gorges, was immortalized in <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON>'s Depression-era song `` Roll On, <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'' _ `` <PERSON> Green </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> fir where the waters cut through, Down her wild mountains and canyons she flew, Canadian North-west to the ocean so blue, It's roll on, <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>, roll on!'' But after the construction of more than a dozen dams in 51 years, the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> has rolled nearly to a standstill. For much of its 1,214 miles, the river is a series of dams and slackwater reservoirs, providing electricity, irrigation and flood control for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> claims one last free-flowing stretch _ the 55-mile Hanford Reach _ and it too is facing major development. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> is proposing a $ 180 million project to open the river to barge traffic all the way to <LOCATION> Wenatchee </LOCATION>, so that logs, wheat and apples from the state's interior can be floated to <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> ports. The plan calls for dredging part of the river and building giant lifts over three dams to allow navigation between <LOCATION> Richland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wenatchee </LOCATION>. Opponents say the dredging would forever ruin valuable fish and wildlife habitat, archaeological sites and the last vestige of natural river flow. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s congressional delegation has introduced legislation to protect the area. The reach `` is one of the only areas where spawning habitats remain undisturbed, nesting areas abound, and majestic cliffs lining the river are mirrored in its quiet, deep calm,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, R-Wash. `` We're telling them do n't go ahead with these ill-conceived plans until we know the impact on spawning and recreation, the most important use of the river,'' said Republican Rep. <PERSON> Sid </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, whose district includes the area Under the bill, the Department of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> would protect the Hanford Reach for eight years until a study determines whether to permanently preserve the stretch under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. The bill has already cleared the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> but <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> has delayed House action while negotiations continue to address concerns of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>. That agency operates the <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> nuclear reservation, a sprawling plutonium-production site that straddles the river. The Energy Department is worried the study could hamper Hanford operations, said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Seeley </PERSON>, a legislative aide to <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>. There lies the irony of the `` wild and scenic'' designation: as the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> flows past nine federal nuclear reactors no one would call the view pastoral. The huge, eerie reactors, technological marvels in their time, produced much of the plutonium for the nation's nuclear weapons arsenal. The slow-moving river creeps past the hulking reactors, with pumping stations, razor-wire fences and guard towers casting shadows over the water. Eight are closed permanently. The newest, the N Reactor, which was placed on `` cold standby'' earlier this year because the federal government no longer needed the plutonium, stands closest to the river, a brooding presence amid the jumping fish, herons and deer. Much of the shore is off-limits to recreational users because the federal government wanted a buffer zone around its reactors. The Hanford Reach runs from Priest Rapids Dam, south of <LOCATION> Mattawa </LOCATION>, to the reservoir of <PERSON> McNary </PERSON> <PERSON> Dam </PERSON> just north of <LOCATION> Richland </LOCATION>. The biggest objections to the dredging are that the movement of a half-million cubic yards of dirt would destroy some of the last wild runs of chinook salmon, which battle their way up river to spawn. `` That's one of the few or perhaps the only remaining natural spawning area in that entire river system below Grand Coulee -LRB- dam -RRB- that salmon and steelhead can get too,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Neal </PERSON>, deputy director the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> has proposed building an artificial salmon spawning channel, to compensate for areas lost to dredging. But opponents say that would not work. `` Artificial spawning channels just do n't provide the quantity and quality of reproduction that the natural free-flowing river provides,'' <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> said. `` The technology has n't been that well-perfected.'' The dredging proposal has also run into stiff fiscal opposition. The cost-benefit ratio for the project currently stands at just 80 cents in benefits for every dollar spent, said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Sellar </PERSON>, manager of water resources for the Port of <LOCATION> Chelan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Wenatchee </LOCATION>, which has been pushing the plan since the 1950s. The port and the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> are now studying the plan to try to make it economically stronger. For instance, some people feel that large quantities of apples could not be moved by barge because of the length of the trip, but others say using refrigerated containers would keep them fresh, <PERSON> Sellar </PERSON> said. The port hopes to save up to 40 percent in transportation costs compared to rail or trucking. `` One barge will move the equivalent of 50 to 60 trucks,'' <PERSON> Sellar </PERSON> said.

<DATELINE>AVERY ISLAND, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Roll down the car window anywhere near the plant where <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s most famous hot sauce still is made from a century-old recipe, and your head just fills up with the scent _ a little tomatoey, a little spicy, a lot hot. The odor is so much a part of the place that <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> C.P </PERSON>. <PERSON> McIlhenny </PERSON>, whose family has been making Tabasco sauce from the start, does n't even notice it unless he's up close to the pulp barrels. Hot sauce in southern <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> is like that smell. It's everywhere On every table in every restaurant. Two dozen or so varieties. <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> hot sauce is a tourist attraction: It's on posters and coffee mugs and key chains, and people take tours of hot sauce factories. `` In the river parishes, where the Acadians first landed, its hard not to find a bottle of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> hot sauce on the table,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Folse </PERSON>, a chef and restaurateur in <LOCATION> Donaldsonville </LOCATION> who introduced Cajun food to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> during the summit meeting earlier this year. `` It's almost like salt, pepper and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> hot.'' There is, of course, the theory that people who live in such steamy heat eat hot foods to perspire and cool off. `` My mother's people and my father's people grew hot peppers because they thought they were good for you,'' said television's down-home Cajun chef, <PERSON> Justin </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> But there's much more than science at work in a land where what to eat for dinner is often the focus of luncheon conversation and what to eat tomorrow is the dinner-table talk. Good food really matters here. `` When someone asks, ` What are you doing this afternoon?, You say, ` Oh I do n't know, maybe a crawfish boil.' They always think in terms of cooking,'' said <PERSON> Folse </PERSON>. And most everything _ even to a bloody <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> sorbet, says <PERSON> Folse </PERSON> _ gets a dash or two of hot sauce. `` I do n't think anything's worth a darn unless it's seasoned well,'' said <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, who is partial to cayenne peppers. <PERSON> McIlhenny </PERSON>, 44, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> McIlhenny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, figures he goes through a 2-ounce bottle a month of Tabasco, which, by the way, is not a generic name, though <PERSON> McIlhenny </PERSON>'s pleased if you think so. Hot sauce is addictive, he said. `` I've had friends use it out of loyalty, and then say, ` Hey, this is good,' as if it was a surprise. They say they get addicted.'' So it's no surprise there are so many kinds _ Tabasco, <PERSON> Trappey </PERSON>'s, <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Cachere </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Creole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sauce </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Crystal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sauce </ORGANIZATION>, Cajun Chef, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Gold, <ORGANIZATION> Durkee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sauce </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Panola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Cajun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sauce </ORGANIZATION>. You get the idea. A premium sauce, it's agreed, uses only the pepper pulp. No seeds or skin. Most contain just salt, vinegar and peppers, although some labels say it fancier. Crystal, for example, lists `` fresh ripe aged peppers,'' and Cajun Chef contains `` select <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> cayenne peppers.'' So, can connoisseurs distinguish among them? Sure, said <PERSON> Folse </PERSON>, noting that most chefs stock four of five varieties. `` I've got items in my kitchen I use Tabasco on. However, I also really like <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Gold,'' he said. `` I do n't find that it's quite as hot as Tabasco ... and when you have five or six chefs on the line, you want to have a little control If they put one shot or two shots, you do n't want to change the flavor competely.'' `` They all have a little different flavor, and they all use a little different amounts of vinegar, salt,'' said <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. `` There are certain ones I prefer. ... It's just a question of experience, and God knows I have a lot of that.'' The <ORGANIZATION> McIlhenny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, too, has plenty of experience. Tabasco is sold in 100 countries; it's been on space missions. `` We end up in strange places,'' said <PERSON> McIlhenny </PERSON>. `` I understand two or three Sherpas in <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> will use a bottle at a single meal.'' <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> is a long way from tiny <LOCATION> Avery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, 18 square miles that are home to 700 people, the Tabasco plant and fields, a salt mine and oil wells. There also are 100,000 snowy egrets, 30,000 azaleas and 17,000 irises. <PERSON> Avery </PERSON> <PERSON> Island </PERSON> is not really an island, but a salt dome that rises from the marshes and bayous on <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s Gulf Coast. At 152 feet above sea level, the island is the highest point along the gulf from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. It sits 150 miles from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, separated by sugar cane, rice and oil fields. In 1818, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsh </PERSON> obtained rights to part of the island, and later a <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> judge, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Dudley </PERSON> <PERSON> Avery </PERSON>, bought part. In 1837 <PERSON> Avery </PERSON> married <PERSON> Marsh </PERSON>'s daughter and eventually obtained the entire island. In 1859, <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> McIlhenny </PERSON> married an Avery daughter. The story is told, though not verified, that the family fled <LOCATION> Avery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in the Civil War and returned to find everything destroyed _ except one defiant pepper plant grown from a seed or seedling given to <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> by a friend returning from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. What is known is that <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> McIlhenny </PERSON> came up with a sauce to perk up the bland food available during Reconstruction. n 1868, he packed his invention in ladies' perfume bottles, and sent samples off to 350 wholesalers. Two years later he had a patent, and in two years more a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> office to handle all the European orders. His sauce used a variety of Capsicum frutescens, a small fire-engine-red pepper, of which the <ORGANIZATION> McIlhenny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> today is the world's largest producer. Tabasco is an Indian word for damp earth, which <ORGANIZATION> McIlhenny </ORGANIZATION> apparently chose because he liked the sound of it. One hundred twenty years later, little has changed. <PERSON> McIlhenny </PERSON> is still a family company, with <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> McIlhenny </PERSON> and two cousins in charge. And <PERSON> Avery </PERSON> <PERSON> Island </PERSON> is their kingdom. `` This is an ideal site,'' said <PERSON> McIlhenny </PERSON>. `` Part of the mystique is that only the soil, only the climate, only the nimble fingers of <LOCATION> Avery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> could pick Tabasco.'' The peppers are harvested in summer, by hand, and must be processed the same day. But today, only 10 percent of the peppers needed are grown on the island. To protect against disease, pests, hurricanes and labor troubles, seeds for the rest of the peppers are sent to Central and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The mash is returned to <LOCATION> Avery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> McIlhenny </PERSON> inspects every white oak barrel of mash for aroma, color, particle size. He rejects one barrel in 100. The pulp is mashed with salt _ eight pounds to 100 pounds of peppers _ and aged three years. The mash is then mixed with a strong white vinegar and stirred mechanically for 28 days. Finally, it is strained and bottled. And even then it's not just a bottle of sauce. `` Hot sauces in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> are almost a religion,'' said <PERSON> Folse </PERSON>. `` You go to church on Sunday, hot sauce on Monday through Friday.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ As the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's lease on the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> runs out, so does <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s tenure as secretary of state. He leaves behind him no foreign policy `` doctrine,'' no ringing rhetoric. But world affairs have changed significantly during his stewardship, and now peace seems to be erupting in unexpected places. Here's a portrait of a low-key diplomat who seems to have been more concerned with the process than with himself.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 He sometimes talked about his job as `` pick-and-shovel work'' and himself as a `` gardener,'' images no one would have pinned to the office that <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> endowed with jet-set glitter, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> <PERSON> Dulles </PERSON> with a prophetic edge, and <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Acheson </PERSON> with aristocratic elegance. Those three earlier secretaries of state over the past half-century performed naturally on a floodlit stage that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> just as naturally avoids. Unlike them, he's never been the source of memorable quotations. Despite his years as a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> insider, he much resembles what in fact he is: a <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor on leave. `` They've established a chair in my honor,'' he has said. `` I told them that when I'm through with this job, I'll need a couch.'' He'll be through in January, along with the administration he serves, but its twilight is seeing a remarkable splurge of peacemaking in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomacy. Peace may be coming to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and southwestern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, where preliminary agreements may point to the ultimate withdrawal of up to 50,000 Cuban troops. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, in a startling turnabout, has accepted a cease-fire in its war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Soviet troops are leaving <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Pro-Soviet <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> is accelerating a military withdrawal from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. Peace in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is more elusive and in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> has expended much effort, negotiations between Israelis and Arabs seem as distant as ever. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s interest in the <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> antedates his appointment as secretary of state. He is former president of the <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> group, an international construction and engineering firm that made a fortune in the Arab world. When President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> appointed <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> in July 1982, his views on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> came under intense congressional scrutiny. Against the apprehensions of some, he has emerged as one of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s staunchest friends. On a recent visit to <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told a group of <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> journalists that a total <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> withdrawal from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> was `` not in the cards,'' and neither was a Palestinian state. Traditionally, diplomats make cooing sounds in such circumstances. Jordanian authorities never permitted the interview to appear in print or on the air. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, 67, will leave office without leaving a foreign policy `` doctrine'' or historic milestone associated with his name. Some see his main accomplishment as secretary of state is keeping a highly conservative administration on a moderate course in dealing with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. His approach dovetailed with the rise to power in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> three years ago of a pragmatic Soviet leader, <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. U.S.-Soviet summit meetings are now annual occurrences. How much credit belongs to <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>? How much to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>? And how much to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who not so long ago called the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> an `` evil empire''? It's anybody's guess. But the fact is that the two sides signed a historic treaty last year to abolish all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet intermediate-range nuclear missiles and to exchange inspectors to ensure the deal is kept. The way was cleared in monthly meetings between <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. Moreover, there is a framework in place for the next president _ Democrat or Republican _ to make more weapons cutbacks and to reconcile superpower differences around the world. `` So far as his recognition that there's been a fundamental change in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, he's been a good influence in toning down the president,'' said former Undersecretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>, otherwise a critic of <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, especially on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> also eased frictions with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and strengthened <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ties with the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and other <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> allies. `` He's been upfront,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Dante </PERSON> <PERSON> Fascell </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` He's well liked by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. We do n't always agree with him. But the judgment on both sides of the aisle is he's a good secretary of state.'' Did <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> try hard to talk <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> out of sending <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> TOW </LOCATION> missiles to the Iranians in a futile attempt to free American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>? `` I wonder if there is more that I could have done,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said after the Iran-Contra scandal broke. `` I believe there was. I do n't give myself any plus on this.'' Some on Capitol Hill are more critical. Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Toricelli </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, who heard him in closed testimony before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, says <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> `` did more than separate himself from White House policies on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. He built a wall between himself and the White House.'' Critics of the president's ambitious and, they say, fanciful Star Wars project wonder if <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> tried to slow the project down and have found him ambiguous. Asked on national television whether he supported or opposed a so-called `` broad interpretation'' of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty to allow debatable tests and early deployment, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> played it close to the vest. The result was a headline in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> the next morning that `` Shultz Rules Out ` Star Wars' Move Within Two Years'' and a headline in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, `` Shultz Accepts Broad View Of ABM Pact.'' Quizzed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> was not much clearer. He said the program should be deployed only after it was found to be effective and worth the enormous investment in it. Was he subtly trying to slow down the program, which <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>, then the <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary and a former <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> colleague, was eager to deploy? Or was he for Star Wars full blast? `` I do n't have a clear picture where he stands on Star Wars,'' former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms control director <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Warnke </PERSON> says. `` I think he felt this was the president's magnificent obsession and he was n't going to do anything about it. But <PERSON> Warnke </PERSON>, an ardent proponent of arms control, gives <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> high grades for vigorously promoting the missile-ban treaty. `` He definitely had his heart in arms control,'' <PERSON> Warnke </PERSON> says. Similarly, former Sen. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Fulbright </PERSON>, who practices law in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and still keeps an eye on foreign policy trends, says that what pleases him most is `` this move toward conciliation with the Russians.''

 On the other hand, <PERSON> Fulbright </PERSON>, a former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, calls the hard-line <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> `` a great mistake.'' And in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, he says, `` We've always been so completely supportive of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> there's not much chance of a compromise.'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>, who held an important <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> post in the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> administration, concurs. He faults <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> for `` inepitude'' in trying to work out a deal between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1982 without consulting <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, and then ignoring President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> for years because he did n't go along. <ORGANIZATION> Fascell </ORGANIZATION> credits <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> with toughness and willingess to lay his prestige on the line in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, `` although you ca n't say <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> was a success.'' There, 241 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen were killed in October 1983 when a Marine command center was blown up. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> peacekeeping forces, which critics said had been foolishly exposed, were then withdrawn. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Laitin </PERSON>, a longtime government press officer who worked for <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>, tried to explain <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> this way: `` You have to remember the animal trainer describing how an elephant moves. He puts one leg forward, shifts his body over to that foot to see if it will hold him, then moves the next foot forward. He never leaves his moorings in one place without having another mooring. He's no great risk-taker.'' The ringing declaration, the apocalyptic pronouncement were not <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s style. He did n't convey the impression that the world's fate hinged on his success in persuading foreign leaders to support his policies For six years, plodding through U.S.-Soviet, <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> arms control diplomacy, he methodically recited to reporters, `` You do n't have an agreement until you have an agreement,'' which seems to echo baseball's <PERSON> Yogi </PERSON> <PERSON> Berra </PERSON>'s, `` It ai n't over till it's over.'' But if reporters found the secretary less than electrifying, neither did he play games with them, such as hiding behind `` background'' and not-for-attribution rituals in the ancient <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> tradition. He said what he had to say on the record, even when it meant admitting the failure of a high-stakes mission. And he persevered. He worked in behalf of Jews and other minorities who were prevented from emigrating from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. He made a point of giving human rights a `` pride of place'' on his agenda in all his sessions with Soviet leaders. He arranged meetings with dissidents in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and emigres in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> to lend symbolic support to their cause. Low-key team player that he was much of the time, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> could dissent sharply and publicly. He bristled at a White House order in 1985 to subject all government officials in sensitive positions to lie detector tests. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> would have none of it personally and threatened to resign unless the order was modified. It was. When <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> two years ago decided to sell subsidized wheat to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> called the sales `` ridiculous.'' Having led the opposition within the administration, he kept up his criticism after he lost. The Soviets, he said, must be chortling over paying less for American-produced food than American housewives. There was risk in such self-assertion. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Iran-Contras investigating committees, `` You must be willing to say goodbye, and I am.'' He had offered to quit on two other occasions. One was in 1983 when he discovered that <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, then the deputy national security adviser, had made a secret trip to several <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> states without <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s knowledge. He said he told <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, `` Mr. President, you do n't need a guy like me for secretary of <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION> if this is the way things are going to be done.'' The other came in August 1986 when <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> thought some conservatives in the White House subjected him to `` a kind of guerrilla warfare,'' to the point of hamstringing his authority to use government aircraft for his <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> business. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> served in the Marines in World War II and met his wife, <PERSON> Helena </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, where she was an Army nurse. They have five children and five grandchildren. When <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> to succeed <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> in June 1982, he was summoned from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, where he had been on a business trip. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> was to meet with the president at Camp <PERSON> David </PERSON>, and he found two limousines waiting for him at the airport. One was for him, he was told, the other to take his wife wherever she wanted to go while he had his interview with the president. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> waved off the second car. `` No, she will come with me,'' he said. `` We are a package deal.'' He is the first man in history to have served in four Cabinet posts _ State, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> _ 11 years in all of Cabinet service. A measure of his aptitude for conciliation and avoiding controversy is that he held three of these posts under <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and emerged unscathed by any of that administration's notoriety and scandal. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Laitin </PERSON>'s theory, shared by others, is that while <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> is a team player, he also has a well-developed `` protective mechanism.'' `` It was not that he was fighting them all the time,'' says <PERSON> Laitin </PERSON>. `` There was an old-shoe relationship between <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> will go along, but at some point instinctively he'll hunker down He will not budge, because he's a man of character.'' As secretary of the treasury, he disregarded a <ORGANIZATION> Nixon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> request to have the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> harass `` enemies'' of the administration, provoking <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> to unflattering comments. And when <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> complained about an <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> audit of his tax return, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told him that every recent president had been similarly audited. He showed no signs of winding down as his tenure neared its end. So far this year, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> has made four trips to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, three to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and a 17-day swing through <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. Why did he keep returning to the <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> despite the refusal of Israelis and Arabs to heed his plea to negotiate? <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> explained he did n't mind fighting long odds, and if he did n't succeed himself, he wanted to lay some groundwork for his successor. Besides, he said, `` What am I saving myself for?'' End Adv for Sunday, Aug. 14

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ Was there ever a golden era of sports in the dim past, as touted by septuagenarian chroniclers? Maybe not, but there's one right now. It's the PGA Senior Tour, where golf's ancient rake in the lucre in post-career careers that lack the pressure and cutthroat solemnity of youthful competition but make up for it in sheer pleasure on the back nine of life

<TEXT>
 At times the senior scene seems lifted live from the frame of an old Dutch golfing print, the whimsical kind you still find hanging in country club corridors and locker rooms. Genial gentlemen of mellowing vintage in broad-brimmed hats and knickerbockers bent over long crooked sticks in studious pursuit of nudging a small white ball across a pleasant expanse of lawn. Or perhaps these are Scottish shepherds who have lost their sheep in the Highland heather. Weep no idle Tennysonian tears for a vanished yesteryear. These are here and now maturing millionaires, some for the second time around, playing the PGA Senior Tour, sports' biggest success story in the past decade. `` It's a Mulligan on life, a chance for a second career at an age when all other athletes are over the hill,'' exulted the Australian <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Crampton </PERSON>, who made a million on the regular tour, retired to hunt oil in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> for eight years, then returned at age 50 to strike it rich again as a senior. In golf, a Mulligan is a second drive off the first tee, allowed in friendly circles to compensate for a dismal start, but purely illegal, even on the Senior tour where the over-50 set now competes in a friendly way for official prize money in excess of $ 10 million. The lucre is so lucrative that last year no fewer than a dozen seniors made more than in their regular career. At least a half-dozen more are poised to join <PERSON> Crampton </PERSON> and seven other seniors who already have won a million on the back nine of life. Here indeed is a new golden age of sport beyond the most avaricious dreams of the actuarial tables. The `` Old Sarge'' <PERSON> Orville </PERSON> <PERSON> Moody </PERSON>, recently matriculated to the millionaire class, is a splendid example of delayed golf growth. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s only win in 17 years on the regular tour was the U.S. Open in 1969. Prior to that, this part-Choctaw Indian spent l4 years in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, rising to the envious rank of non-com in charge of golf installations. Joining the seniors, he tucked a 50-inch long putter, now affectionately known as `` the staff sergeant,'' tight unto his sternum and began pendulum stroking putts that now guarantee a more generous pension than the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> had in mind. In physical contour, <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION> more resembles Sgt. Snorkel in the Beetle <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> comic strip than your supple super jock. Senior millionaires come in all sizes, from the well-rounded <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Casper </PERSON> and <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> to lean and hungry exercise fanatics like <PERSON> Crampton </PERSON>, a daily visitor to the physical fitness van in the parking lot, and <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Player </PERSON>, who still does 300 sit-ups a night on the motel floor. But even with the choice of riding in carts, is n't it hot work for chaps their age to be flailing away with woods and irons across seven miles of uncooperating landscape for the better part of a week? `` Playing golf is NOT hot work,'' demurs <PERSON> Chi </PERSON> <PERSON> Chi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>. `` Cutting sugar cane for a dollar a day, that's hot work, hotter than my first wristwatch.'' <PERSON> Chi </PERSON> <PERSON> Chi </PERSON>, who took up golf at 25 cents a bag as a caddy in his native <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, managed to match in less than 30 months at senior play the million it took him 25 years to win on the regular tour. `` Anything is possible in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' says this jovial ambassador of the friendly, laid-back brand of golf that has made the senior tour such a hit with the galleries and TV audiences. Instantly recognizable in his straw fedora, <PERSON> Chi </PERSON> <PERSON> Chi </PERSON> finds time to chat with the fans behind the marshals' ropes, to autograph caps and sun visors and visit with kids and old people in wheelchairs. After sinking a 20-footer, he goes into his duelist act, wiping imaginary blood from his putter and seemingly sheathing it like a swordsman returning a sabre to its scabbard. Suddenly golf is fun again, in an age when so many younger players come across as unsmiling, monosyllabic, computer-programmed golfing machines, abandoning the color and drama to foreign players like the fiery Spaniard, <PERSON> Seve </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballesteros </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s `` Great White Shark'' <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>, and Masters champion <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON>, the slender <PERSON> Scot </PERSON> who deepened golf's mystique by revealing that his girlfriend cured his tensions by tickling his feet.

 <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Player </PERSON>, the South African gold miner's son who at 50 found a new mother lode on the fairways, is convinced that in two years the senior tour will outshine the regular PGA circuit when enduring idols <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicklaus </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Trevino </PERSON> reach their semi-centennial. This Mulligan on life enabled <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Littler </PERSON> to put another million toward his hobby of collecting Rolls Royces after a bout with cancer almost ended a great career that at age 58 is still rolling in putts and prize money. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mowry </PERSON>, whose `` best friend _ V.O. and coke'' betrayed him into dissipating early promise, joined Alcoholics Anonymous and came back with white hair and a steadier putting hand. He's become a consistent money winner among the seniors. Riding a golf cart has enabled <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, the gutsy former paratrooper, to earn a half million in the senior game after four operations on his right knee, mangled in a jump at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION>. `` They're coming back from the dead; this is the greatest thing that ever happened in any sport,'' says <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Trent </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, the 82-year old golf course architect who still tees it up to test out his creations around the globe. All sorts of <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitty </PERSON> dreams are played out on the back nine of life. <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Zembriski </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> steel worker who used to tiptoe out on skyscraper girders, is now walking on air in the top-20 senior money list. Among the born-again at 50 are <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who spent l5 years in the auto repair business, and <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Boles </PERSON>, a former mortician. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> righthander voted most valuable player in the 1962 World Series, smiles out from bubblegum cards and takes the mound at old-timers games at <LOCATION> Cooperstown </LOCATION>. But he's just a novice on the senior tour, not yet in the prize money class with <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Brodie </PERSON>, quarterback with the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> 49ers for l6 years, who turned to golf as a third career after a decade in the <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> sports booth. Having your intellect scrambled by the likes of Big Daddy <PERSON> Lipscomb </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rosey </PERSON> <PERSON> Grier </PERSON> can be wonderful conditioning for golf's hard knocks `` I've been up by three touchdowns and forgotten to win,'' <PERSON> Brodie </PERSON> philosophized after blowing a two-stroke lead to <PERSON> Chi </PERSON> <PERSON> Chi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> in April. `` In golf you just wait until the end and add it up.'' Resilience of this sort enabled <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Ezinicki </PERSON>, former left-winger with the <ORGANIZATION> Toronto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leafs </ORGANIZATION>, to trade in his hockey stick for a persimmon wood and win the New England Seniors title. Pros getting a mite long in the tooth but shorter on drives competed long before the <ORGANIZATION> PGA </ORGANIZATION> formalized a seniors tour in 1980. In 1937, three years after he inaugurated the Masters, <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of Grand Slam fame gathered some friends, including 23 <ORGANIZATION> Scots </ORGANIZATION>, eight Englishmen, two Irishmen and only four Americans, at <ORGANIZATION> Augusta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> for the first PGA Seniors Championship. The purse totaled $ 2,000, which was generous in an era when <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Snead </PERSON> got $ 45 a month to represent the <LOCATION> Greenbrier </LOCATION> resort on tour and <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagen </PERSON> tipped his caddy his entire check for winning the British Open, $ 240. <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> promulgated golf as a sport for all ages by installing a putting green on the White House lawn and assigning the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to shag balls at <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION>. But senior tournament golf took off when <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> in 1978 aired the finish of the first Legends of Golf from <LOCATION> Onion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The brainchild of producer <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Raphael </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Demaret </PERSON>, that unforgettable blithe spirit in purple saddle oxfords and polka-dot slacks, the Legends had going for it a $ 400,000 purse, a team format pairing the best of yesteryear and a thrilling three-birdie finale by <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Snead </PERSON>. The popularity of the Legends, which <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hope </PERSON> dubbed `` The Prune Juice Open,'' prompted the PGA to add other senior events that soon attracted corporate sponsors. Now there are 37 stops on the Senior PGA Tour, including the Chrysler Cup, an international competition that recently spotlighted <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s 65-year-ld <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Vicenzo </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s 63-year-old <PERSON> Christy </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Madza </ORGANIZATION> Champions, which pairs the cream of the oldsters with the best of the women pros in quest of a $ 500,000 team check Many other events outside the tour include a TV senior skins game, which featured 76-year-old <PERSON> Snead </PERSON>, and a growing foreign circuit that already stretches from <LOCATION> Rich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Narita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.

 In <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, army inductees fresh out of school are so poorly educated that they ca n't understand simple orders in Russian, and even need to be taught how to brush their teeth. Two hours a week, a class of 14-year-old <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> boys dons blue smocks and grinds bolts on aging metal lathes. Their female classmates sew dresses, using treadle machines that would have been familiar to their great-grandmothers. With surprising suddenness and unanimity reminiscent of the panic in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after the first Sputnik launch in 1957, Soviets have discovered that their schools now dispense largely outdated and irrelevant learning, and that their country is falling behind. `` I'm ashamed to say it, but my grandchildren study more or less from the textbooks I used as a child before the war,'' one man wrote earlier this year in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily Pravda. `` <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> may know how to read, but he does n't know how to program a computer,'' says a Moscow-based Western diplomat who specializes in Soviet education but asked not to be identified by name. The catalyst for the change is <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s ambitious drive to rebuild society and modernize and streamline the economy to enable his nation to compete with the developed West. For <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the Soviet school is both a problem and a solution. `` We pin hopes for the future largely on the work of our school _ which is only natural _ with its own restructuring, its own teaching talents and the creative pursuits of the Soviet teacher,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told a meeting of party leaders who met this year to consider school reforms. Authorities are re-examining how the rigidly centralized curriculum prepares the country's 57 million school pupils and university students for life. They are even questioning whether rote learning, long the mainstay of Soviet education, should not yield at least in part to free debate. But officials say changing the system wo n't affect the school's role in bringing up children with socialist values How they will reconcile that task with the promotion of a freer learning environment is still an open question. In January 1984, party officials announced the country's schools were being revamped to stress trade skills. Then-Education Minister <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Prokofiev </PERSON> said the objective was to double enrollment in technical institutes. Those goals were opposed by many parents who wanted their children to learn more than just a trade. That objective has now been turned on its head, and a sense of urgency imparted by the feeling that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is slipping further behind the West, technologically, intellectually and culturally. Soviet achievements in space, theoretical science and high-tech armaments are well-known, and the result of a network of state institutes, think tanks and military-industrial agencies that enlist many of the country's best brains. But for the vast majority of Soviets, education has meant little more than vocational training. `` The main task of the changes undertaken is to make school more humanitarian, to give up the technocratic view that only technical upbringing is necessary,'' <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dneprov </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pedagogical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> said recently. Educators are debating whether a 10-year general education course should be mandatory for all children, or whether most youngsters should continue to be shunted into trade or vocational institutes after eight years of schooling. More alarming for Soviets is the realization that even the professional training given their children, like the courses in bolt-grinding dispensed to some <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> teens, may bear no relation to job demands of the post-industrial age. Soviet schools now turn out 2.5 million skilled workers annually, but officials say the instruction they receive often lags behind innovations at the workplace. `` This means that the technological complexity of operations grows at a much faster pace than the level of workers' skills,'' <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, the No. 2 <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader, told the party meeting on education in February. The inadequacy of job training extends to the most complex professions. <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chazov </PERSON>, minister of health, has told one American researcher that 40 percent of Soviet medical school graduates do not know how to read a cardiogram.

 The scale of the Kremlin's ambitions, and the problems it must surmount, are evident in computer science and information processing, a field once scorned as a bourgeois `` pseudo-science'' but now seen as vital to technological progress. By <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> decree, 98 percent of the country's general education courses teach children about computers. But at last count, only 1.5 percent had the machines. In February, School No. 109 in southwest <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> received 12 Soviet-made personal computers, but some of the squat black machines have sat on a table in <PERSON> Yakov </PERSON> <PERSON> Z. </PERSON> <PERSON> Voronov </PERSON>'s classroom for more than three months because no one has been found to install them. Despite the long wait, the math teacher is enthusiastic. `` Once the kids do their lessons with the computers, the computer will give them their grade,'' <PERSON> Voronov </PERSON> says. `` They'll love it.'' That notion _ that learning should be fun _ is one Western educators find conspicuously absent from the Soviet system, whose textbooks are crammed with gray type and devoid of bright illustrations and graphics. A far more prevalent attitude toward learning is expressed by the Russian maxim, `` Repetition is the mother of knowledge.'' For decades, memorization has been at the core of Soviet education. `` They know lots of facts,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalkstein </PERSON>, an English teacher at <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Andover </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, who taught 17-year-old Soviet exchange students last year. `` But they are expected to be passive in class until their turn comes to read something aloud, and that's not very often.'' By age 15, students in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> physics teacher <PERSON> Gavriil </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Braziler </PERSON>'s class are plotting the movements of electrons and protons through magnetic and electric fields. That does n't mean they understand what they are doing. `` They do n't know what elementary particles are. But they learn how to solve the problems,'' <PERSON> Braziler </PERSON> says. However, many Soviet educators say that the ability to regurgitate answers is no longer enough to meet the confusing demands of a changing world. `` I do n't want them to say something or believe something just because it's me who says it,'' says <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamburg </PERSON>, principal of School 109. <LOCATION> Yamburg </LOCATION> concedes that `` for a mass of teachers, it's hard to get used to students not all being in agreement.'' The 3-million-strong corps of Soviet teachers and professors, ritually lauded but poorly paid, has come in for special attention, as well as criticism, under the reforms. To draw more qualified people to the profession, wages have been raised. A beginning teacher, once paid about $ 150 a month, now earns about $ 230. That's still well below the average factory worker's wage of $ 330. A teachers congress has been called to set tougher standards for the profession. The party's demand for educational reform had its first institutional effect in March when the trio of ministries overseeing Soviet schools was replaced by a single state committee on education. In May, the head of the committee, <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yagodin </PERSON>, canceled final exams for 10th-graders in history, because their textbooks had been outdated by media revelations about the crimes of <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> and the corrupt reign of <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>. A new generation of textbooks more in tune with the spirit of `` glasnost,'' or openness, is now in the works. The <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> also recognizes the need to invest more in schools themselves, 40 percent of which now lack basic plumbing. <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> said schools for 28 million pupils will be built by the year 2000, and that capital expenditures in education will increase drastically. Despite the vast changes planned, officials stress that the Soviet school will not abandon its role as the creator of future citizens committed to following the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> line. `` One of the tasks of the school in the <LOCATION> U.S.S.R. </LOCATION> is to bring up Soviet boys and girls as dedicated champions of revolutionary ideas and traditions, people who are striving and able to uphold and implement the policy of the party,'' <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> said. For teens, that upbringing includes a course called `` Military Preparation'' in which boys learn how to fire a rifle and maneuver in trenches and girls study to be field nurses. In his speech to the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leadership, <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> sounded a note of urgency by tying the fate of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s entire campaign for economic and social reform to changes made in Soviet schools. `` The general educational and professional preparation of this generation, the world outlook and moral values it will acquire _ on this, to a large extent, depend ... the future of our country and the fate of socialism itself,'' he said.

 On the lapel of his dark-blue school blazer, one <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> teen-ager wears a badge of <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>, founder of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. His classmate sports a button of <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>, founder of the Beatles. Both are students at a school in the flatlands of southwestern <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamburg </PERSON> is trying to encourage wide-ranging inquiry and tolerance to help children cope with the demands of modern Soviet society. In the three-story H-shaped building were <LOCATION> Yamburg </LOCATION> works as principal, 1,500 pupils and 76 teachers meet six days a week in split morning and afternoon sessions for the purpose of education. It is a business that <LOCATION> Yamburg </LOCATION>, 37, finds tremendously exciting. `` What we are trying to do is launch each child on an individual trajectory for his development,'' says the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> member, himself a son of teachers. `` Children are like barrels. Some you can fill up with just a little bit; others are bottomless. Each is different.'' Middle School No. 109, which sits in the middle of apartment high-rises, is a synthesis of the traditional in Soviet education and of the new possibilities now opening under Kremlin reforms. <LOCATION> Yamburg </LOCATION> says his is `` just an ordinary school,'' but <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> officials brought him to a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> news conference this year to talk about changes needed in education nationwide. `` You can go to him with any question and get a sensible, well-thought-out answer,'' says <PERSON> Tanya </PERSON> <PERSON> Litvinov </PERSON>, 15, a student at <LOCATION> Yamburg </LOCATION>'s school. `` He is open to us and to our problems.'' One middle-aged Soviet visitor found School 109 strikingly different from the schools he attended as a child. `` Most schools in this country are like military barracks. This one is different, and you see it right away.'' As <LOCATION> Yamburg </LOCATION> lopes through his school's strawberry-colored halls, children wish him good day, and he returns their greeting with a smile. In one classroom, 9-year-old girls in brown uniforms and white lace collars and boys in single-breasted blue blazers slowly repeat as teacher <PERSON> Yevgenia </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Potapov </PERSON> introduces them to the complexities of Russian spelling. Above the blackboard a red sign bearing the image of <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> proclaims: `` Lenin is even now more alive than the living.'' Up the stairs, a classroom of 15-year-olds openly disagree about the role of <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> in the Soviet past. `` He had a lot to do with the industrialization and collectivization of our country,'' says one blond-haired boy. `` Some consider him a criminal because he ruined our country's economic system,'' says another <LOCATION> Yamburg </LOCATION> relishes the debate. `` As someone who started life as a student of history, I feel my chief task is to form non-conformist minds, so that children are immune to mass manipulation,'' he tells a visiting reporter as he puffs on a Vietnamese-made cigarette. The principal, with graying temples, also teaches history nine hours a week, using recent newspaper and magazine articles because textbooks have been outpaced by the official criticism now leveled at <LOCATION> Stalin </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Yamburg </LOCATION> also assigns his students to compare historical accounts in Pravda, <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> and other Soviet newspapers and has discussed the strengths and weaknesses of socialism and capitalism with them. `` We try to raise children to see all sides of the problem, then to see the alternatives,'' <LOCATION> Yamburg </LOCATION> says. `` That's our ideal here.''

 The multimillionaire developing Key West's choicest chunk of land, the city's biggest-ever real estate project, is beset by a dilemma: Having clawed his way out of poverty, he now fears his money will corrupt him `` The habitual creation of wealth for its own sake destroys souls,'' frets <PERSON> Pritam </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, a 35-year-old hippie-turned-capitalist, as he recounts King Midas' bitter lesson. `` I do n't want that to happen to me.'' <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> first dreamed up the $ 200 million `` small town'' he's building years ago at a commune where he converted to the Sikh faith The 102-acre Truman Annex property, the site of President <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>'s beloved `` Little White House'' winter retreat, became a ghost town after the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> retired it in 1974. The defunct <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> base went to public auction in September 1986. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> paid $ 17 million for a chance to fulfill his dream of a 19th century-style village of houses and condos where neighbors are neighborly. But that's not all he's accomplishing in this overbuilt city, where soaring real estate prices have made out-of-town developers as welcome as hurricanes. When the Annex went to auction, city officials feared slick outsiders concerned strictly with cash flow would replace historic buildings with glitzy condos. Instead they got <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, odd-looking with his turban and trademark blue jeans, but with a reputation for doing high-quality historic renovations in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. Now the former poor boy is on his way to hero status among the crusty locals here, known as `` Conchs.'' <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> cultivated the Conchs last year by asking them how he should develop his land. Hundreds obliged, packing town meetings to tell him. He used some of the ideas and celebrated his development's official opening last year by tossing a $ 35,000 party for the locals. In April 1987, the mayor was among 300 guests at his traditional Sikh wedding on the Little White House lawn. This Easter, he and his wife invited local kids for an egg hunt. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> dressed as the Easter bunny and passed out goodies. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> is building at least 125 `` affordable housing'' condos, priced at under $ 100,000, well below the $ 225,000 to $ 700,000 of the 126 other condos. Re-sale profits on affordable housing units, meant for his employees, will be capped to keep out speculators. The first residents should start moving in at the end of this year. Besides condos and 61 single-family lots, <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> is also building a yacht club, marina and artists' retreat. On <LOCATION> Sunset </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, a short ferry ride across from his mainland property, he's building a lagoon and 154-room hotel, and is importing <LOCATION> Bahamian </LOCATION> sand for a beach. Some of the projects of <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which was founded in 1978 and has offices in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and now Key West, include the $ 11 million Inn By The Sea in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elizabeth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>; the $ 2 million Merchants Row retail complex, a renovation of a 19th century seaport warehouse in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>; the $ 3.1 million Ammerdown Place apartment complex renovation, also in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>; the $ 2 million Petroleum Building in the historic design zone of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>, N.M. Soon after the scraggly bearded <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> bought the Truman Annex, he soothed city commissioners by whisking them by jet on a $ 10,000 trip to see the hotel and smaller projects near <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>. Impressed, the commissioners promptly agreed to rewrite the city's development plan so <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> could build 25 percent more units in <LOCATION> Key </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> Locals are pleased that he's following Conch-style architecture of porches, steep roofs, cupolas and widow walks. `` I think to a man, you'll find people pleased with everything he's done,'' says former <LOCATION> Monroe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Wilhelmina </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>, a fourth-generation Conch. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s `` small town'' idea has also been a hit with buyers. Since sales began March 7, the annex has nearly sold out of condos and many of the single-family building lots are gone. `` The vital concept is interaction,'' <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> says. `` More and more in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, people do n't talk.'' There will be no individual mail delivery in his community. `` We'll build our post office and all the people who live there will pick up their own mail. It's going to have a porch with chairs, a coffee machine. You can sit on the porch and meet your neighbors, talk to each other, become friends.''

 The fast sales at the Annex do n't surprise Key West real estate agent <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaniz </PERSON>, who says prices there are par for this city, about the size of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. `` We've been discovered,'' <PERSON> Yaniz </PERSON> says. `` <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON> called this place the St. Tropez of the poor. That's no longer true.'' Condos sell for $ 60,000 to at least $ 500,000, and a concrete block house downtown, in need of repairs, brings about $ 150,000, he says. Ambiance is more important than squeezing in lots of condos, say <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> and his buddy from his commune days, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Josephs </PERSON>, now a <ORGANIZATION> Truman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Annex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> vice president. `` I knew it was going to be an adventure,'' <PERSON> Josephs </PERSON> says. `` And <PERSON> Pritam </PERSON> and I never gave up this dream of creating a community.'' This will be the last major project he'll undertake, says <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, whose son was born at home here on his last birthday, December 22. But he says he wo n't retire. `` Religion and his terror of being poor are his driving factors,'' says <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> writer whose children were friends with the developer before his conversion to <LOCATION> Sikhism </LOCATION>, whose followers all take the surname `` Singh.'' In those days, <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> was <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> LaBombard </PERSON>, a French Canadian. The <LOCATION> Fitchburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, native is the oldest of four sons. His parents divorced and remarried each other four times. His mother worked at a shoe factory. `` My family was extremely poor. Thursday was mustard sandwiches'' for dinner, <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> says. College was `` not even an option.'' Later the family moved to <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, where he attended <ORGANIZATION> Brunswick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. He sometimes stayed with friends, such as author <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>'s family. `` He was n't a hell-raiser in an evil sense,'' says retired vice principal <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON>, who remembers <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> well. `` I had to drive him home quite often because we often had to suspend him for skipping school. He hung around with a group that did quite a bit of rebelling. But he was quite likable.'' After graduation, <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> briefly bummed around in <LOCATION> Key </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, and then moved to the commune where he met his first wife and converted to <LOCATION> Sikhism </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> lived for about a year 16 years ago at a Sikh commune in <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, called Guru Ram Dass Ashram. The Sikhs are vegetarians and neither smoke nor drink. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> was reared a Catholic, but `` I had a problem with the ambiguities of religion. I never separated moral justice from social justice.'' He rejected Buddism as atheistic, but liked the Sikh religion from the start. `` <LOCATION> Sikhism </LOCATION> has one God. Women and men are equal,'' he said. In 1975, he traveled to the sect's <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> `` to see if it was real. I had a tremendous trip. Sikhs are real interesting people. I felt justified in my belief.'' What impressed him most in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> was the Sikhs offering him food and lodging, no questions asked. `` They did n't ask me for anything. I could n't believe it.'' His conversion was sealed. In 1979, he scraped up $ 7,500 to buy and renovate an apartment house. From there, he developed a shopping center and soon he was trying his <ORGANIZATION> Midas </ORGANIZATION> touch on restoring historic buildings, now his specialty. By 1983, his marriage had disintegrated but his thriving business had made him a millionaire. His family lives simply in a renovated Conch house on his land here. Diapers dry on the line outside. Inside, hardwood floors are covered with scatter rugs, and much of the furniture is white wicker. There are no televisions in <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s home, because he ca n't keep his hands off them. `` Everytime I stay in a hotel, I turn on the TV. They're like voodoo machines.'' Instead, he spends about $ 1,000 a year on books and relaxes at his farm in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, which has a temple, waterfall, maple sugar grove, and Japanese and English gardens. He keeps sheep and llamas. `` It's the place I do things I dreamed about doing.'' Key West, <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> says, will be his home even after his development is finished, probably in two years. Then the man with the <LOCATION> Midas </LOCATION> touch will think about relaxing. `` I'm at a cusp. There has to be a balance. The question of ethical livelihood is the thing I'm most interested in,'' <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> says. `` I'd like to be involved in a way that I do n't get eaten.''

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ There's no denying that <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosket </PERSON> showed early promise. By the time he was 15 he had killed two men _ `` for the experience,'' as he put it. In his postgraduate work, <PERSON> Bosket </PERSON> compiled a record of such violence that he'll probably spend the rest of his life in prison, which is not the best of news to the men who staff it.

 <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosket </PERSON>'s meals are slipped into his `` box'' of a prison cell through a slot cut into iron bars. Video cameras monitor his every move, 24 hours a day. When <PERSON> Bosket </PERSON> leaves his cell for any reason, he must first stick his feet through a slot to be manacled and then his hands to be cuffed. Three prison guards watch him when he gets his daily hour of exercise, alone in a small, fenced-in area. The prisoner's hands and feet remain tied. The <LOCATION> Woodbourne </LOCATION> state prison guards keep silent, under orders not even to talk to <PERSON> Bosket </PERSON>. Many people who've come into contact with the 25-year-old killer think that treatment is n't rigorous enough. While there may be more infamous inmates in other prisons, and even in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, the murderer of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> and Son of <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> killer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Berkowitz </PERSON> are doing their time, no one is feared more within the system than <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosket </PERSON>. `` I'm a monster the system created,'' <PERSON> Bosket </PERSON> told an <LOCATION> Oneida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> courtroom last year when sentenced to 25 years to life as a persistent felon. `` I'm a monster that's come back to haunt this system and I will dog this system until it is in its grave.'' To <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Bischert </PERSON>, president of the state prison guards' union, <PERSON> Bosket </PERSON> is a prime argument for the death penalty that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state does not have. `` He probably will kill somebody in the system,'' <PERSON> Bischert </PERSON> says. `` Hopefully, it wo n't be an employee.'' The state went to extraordinary lengths to create a special cell for <PERSON> Bosket </PERSON> after he attacked a security guard on April 16. <PERSON> Bosket </PERSON> walked up behind <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> in a <LOCATION> Shawangunk </LOCATION> state prison waiting room and wordlessly plunged a homemade knife into the rookie guard's back, says prison system spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Flateau </PERSON>. A newspaper reporter, interviewing <PERSON> Bosket </PERSON>, was watching. <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> survived, and <PERSON> Bosket </PERSON> faces an attempted murder charge. It was only the latest entry in a long and violent criminal dossier. <PERSON> Bosket </PERSON> grew up in <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION>, the product of a broken home. In a perverse twist on an old tradition, he began following in the footsteps of a father he never knew. <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosket </PERSON> Sr. graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> while a federal prison inmate and eventually died in an escape attempt. <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosket </PERSON> was 10 when first sent to a detention home. By the time he was 15 he had killed two men in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> subway robberies, shooting one in the face after he put up his hands in surrender and another in the head when he had only pennies. <PERSON> Bosket </PERSON> said he killed `` for the experience.'' Tried as a juvenile for the 1978 killings, he was sentenced to five years. He gloated then that he knew he could have killed 100 people and his sentence would have been the same. Amid public outcry, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> changed state law to allow juveniles as young as 13 to be tried as adults for murder. <PERSON> Bosket </PERSON> served his time in youth detention facilities, where he set some kind of a record for ferocity. He cracked a guard's skull with a pipe, assaulted two othger employees with a hammer, stabbed a fellow inmate with a fork. Despite this he was back on the streets in 1983. The next year, he shot and robbed a nearly blind, elderly man in the subway and was sent to prison for a 3 -LCB- - to 7-year term. He became more intractable than ever. Before stabbing <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>, he was cited for 26 incidents, including nine assaults on the prison staff. Seven times he set his cell on fire. Like most prison guards, <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowers </PERSON> had already heard the stories about <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosket </PERSON> when he learned <PERSON> Bosket </PERSON> was being moved to <LOCATION> Woodbourne </LOCATION>. `` My family was worried,'' says <PERSON> Bowers </PERSON>, married and the father of three. `` I imagine every family would be worried if you had to sit there one-on-one and deal with him.'' At <LOCATION> Woodbourne </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bosket </PERSON> is never left with just one guard. In November 1986, <PERSON> Bosket </PERSON> began kicking and punching a prison guard while being taken to court, despite shackles at his hands and feet. He attacked a second guard who came to the aid of his colleague. <PERSON> Bosket </PERSON> had to be carried into the courtroom and later that day tried to attack another guard with a razor blade he had hidden in his pants. <PERSON> Bosket </PERSON> thrives on attention, prison officials say, and it's probably no coincidence that <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> was stabbed in full view of <LOCATION> Matthew </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, a newspaper reporter who was interviewing <PERSON> Bosket </PERSON> for a book he planned to write about him It was Worth's last of at least 25 interviews he says he conducted after <PERSON> Bosket </PERSON> approached him at his trial and suggested the book. Worth said the biography is now on hold. <PERSON> Bosket </PERSON> is intelligent and can be articulate, Worth says, and talks a lot about his father and how he wound up in prison the same way. `` He says he believes the system is largely responsible for his behavior and he's now responding to the system the best way he knows how and that's through violence,'' Worth says. Since <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>'s stabbing, authorities have barred any interviews with the prisoner. <PERSON> Bosket </PERSON> wrote to social worker <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Honig </PERSON>, asking to circulate a statement that described his condition as `` horrendous.'' <PERSON> Honig </PERSON> says she worked with <PERSON> Bosket </PERSON> at a juvenile detention camp after his subway attacks and now is `` like family'' to him. `` As soon as <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> gets to relate to someone, he's very nice to them,'' she says. `` He's very nice to children, he's very affectionate, he's charming. He only hurts people he does n't know.'' `` <PERSON> Bosket </PERSON> was put in his special security cell both to protect those around him and the prisoner from himself,'' <PERSON> Flateau </PERSON> says. Three adjoining cells were renovated to make <PERSON> Bosket </PERSON>'s quarters. One was emptied of furniture and equipped with a steel wall with a plexiglass window. He speaks with the few visitors he's allowed through a microphone. `` It's probably the most secure cell ever made for an inmate,'' says <PERSON> Bowers </PERSON>.

 EDITOR'S NOTE _ More and more Americans keep tabs on their health through a great variety of home testing kits. They can be fine, medical authorities say, to call attention to symptoms, but diagnosis _ finding the root of the problem _ should be left to physicians

<TEXT>
 When an Italian known to posterity as <PERSON> Sanctorius </PERSON> invented the fever thermometer, it was a cumbersome water-based device that did n't find much of a market, but it was the first step toward the in-home testing kit. The thermometer made its debut in 1626. A few hundred years and several eons of technology later, its descendants are on the way to becoming a billion-dollar industry in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where staying healthy is a leading preoccupation. Today, from store shelves across the nation, consumers buy kits to find their most fertile time of the month, check their blood pressure or blood sugar levels, and screen themselves for possible cancer of the colon or rectum. Americans are expected to spend some $ 616 million this year on home testing kits. Some forecasters believe the figure will rise to more than $ 1 billion a year in the 1990s, driven by new technologies, a `` do-it-yourself'' philosophy among consumers, and cost pressures on hospitals and physicians. But the government has closed the door, at least for now, on home testing for AIDS. And regulators and medical authorities worry about any home test that claims to diagnose a particular disease, especially an infectious one, rather than just detect possible symptoms. Since 1977, the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has approved more than 100 home test kits for sale. Among the most popular kits, used in 1 percent of the nation's homes, are those that let diabetics monitor blood sugar in urine or blood Americans will spend more than $ 200 million this year for those kits or similar tests for urinary tract infection, according to the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> market research firm of Find @ <ORGANIZATION> SVP </ORGANIZATION>. Other kits and their expected sales this year include: _ Devices for testing blood pressure, $ 128 million _ Pregnancy and ovulation detection kits, $ 97 million In 1986 consumers bought 6.1 million pregnancy test kits and about 500,000 ovulation kits. _ Tests that indicate blood in the stool, a sign of possible colon or rectum cancer, $ 43 million And the thermometer? Americans are expected to spend $ 57 million this year on them, Find @ <ORGANIZATION> SVP </ORGANIZATION> says. Medical authorities say home health testing is fine, but they have some reservations. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> believes the kits can help by involving people in decisions about their own health and getting them to doctors sooner if there is trouble, says <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> McGivney </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION>'s director of technology assessment. But there is concern about diagnostic kits, which would be used by people who have a symptom and are trying to find out what the problem is. In this case, a false negative result _ in which the test fails to detect the disease _ could make things worse by encouraging the patient to ignore his condition, <PERSON> McGivney </PERSON> says. Tests must be especially accurate if a false negative result presents a substantial risk to the user or other people, in the case of infectious diseases, <PERSON> McGivney </PERSON> says. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> shares the concern about such kits, said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsakeris </PERSON>, deputy director of <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s division of clinical and laboratory devices in the Office of Device Evaluation. <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> is now reviewing a kit for strep throat that illustrates the dilemma, he says. `` Naturally you want to get at that condition and perhaps reach a population of infecteds you would n't normally reach,'' he says. But `` if you have a high incidence of false negatives and the condition persists, there's a public health risk there'' because the strep bacteria could spread. <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> assesses candidate test kits case-by-case, looking for `` a clear benefit that overcomes any reasonable risk,'' he says. No test is always accurate, and few tests in the home or laboratory are sufficient to diagnose diseases by themselves even when they produce an accurate result, he says. `` If you were to have a test performed in a doctor's office, that test would probably be ordered ... in light of other medical information that the physician would use. It would be part of a diagnostic examination,'' he says. `` Those tests are now being offered directly -LRB- to the public -RRB- without the availability of the other diagnostic information the physician would have.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> blocked home kits for acquired immune deficiency syndrome in April when it essentially forbade kit developers from collecting the data necessary for marketing approval. <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> officials had expressed skepticism about home testing for AIDS, because it is fatal and because federal guidelines say testing should be accompanied by counseling. In general, <PERSON> Tsakeris </PERSON> said, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> wants test kits to work as accurately in the hands of consumers as they do in the lab. Almost all home use kits are based on tests originally used in clinical laboratories, he says. A manufacturer might be able to justify approving a kit with lesser performance if it is `` exquisitely simple,'' deals with a substantial health concern and promises to encourage more people to seek medical care, <PERSON> Tsakeris </PERSON> said. No approvals have been granted yet on that basis. Several factors can reduce the accuracy of home test kits. The test for blood in the stool, for example, has so much potential for wrong results that a doctor should supervise its use, says <PERSON> Joann </PERSON> <PERSON> Schellenbach </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. Inaccurate positive or negative readings can occur if a person's diet is not adjusted for two days before the test It can give a false positive reading if the person has taken a lot of aspirin, had his teeth cleaned or just eaten a rare steak, she said. Such cautions are explained in material accompanying the kits, but people tend to ignore them, she says. The instructions are more likely to be followed on a doctor's advice, she says. In all, the cancer society considers the kits of only limited use, she says, and physician exams are the best way to detect early colon or rectum cancer. But the test kits may be valuable when people just wo n't go to the doctor unless the home test gives them reason to, she says.

 The first time <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Selby </PERSON> kissed a girl on the stage his schoolmates teased him so relentlessly he almost quit acting. That was in the ninth grade. `` It took me a while to get over it,'' says <PERSON> Selby </PERSON>, who stars in the four-hour miniseries `` King of the Olympics: The Lives and Loves of <PERSON> Avery </PERSON> <PERSON> Brundage </PERSON>.'' While <PERSON> Selby </PERSON> temporarily gave up the theater, his faculty adviser at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> suggested that he enroll in an acting course. `` I took it and I've never looked back,'' he says. `` It was a lifesaver. It gave me such an outlook.'' <PERSON> Selby </PERSON>, who has spent a large part of his career on <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION>, is probably best known as <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Channing </PERSON>, the charming cad on the CBS prime-time soap opera `` Falcon Crest,'' In the new miniseries, which will be televised on the <ORGANIZATION> Harmony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Premiere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> in two parts between Aug. 15 and Sept. 15 on 85 stations, <PERSON> Selby </PERSON> has the title role as <PERSON> Avery </PERSON> <PERSON> Brundage </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brundage </PERSON> devoted more than 50 years to his dream of an Olympics that was free of political and economic influences. He was a controversial figure who made some enemies with his combative style and autocratic rule as president of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Olympic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. He participated in the 1912 Summer Games at <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>, but lost in every event to <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorpe </PERSON>. He hoped to participate again in 1916, but the games were canceled by World War I. In 1952, <PERSON> Brundage </PERSON> became president of the Olympics. The miniseries also reveals that although <PERSON> Brundage </PERSON> was married, he kept a mistress in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and had two children by her. `` They sent me the <PERSON> Brundage </PERSON> script and we talked back and forth,'' says <PERSON> Selby </PERSON>. `` The more I learned about <PERSON> Brundage </PERSON> the more I admired him and his energy and the way he raised himself up from his poor beginning. I loved his passion for the Olympics. It was wonderful to play a man with such a strong belief. `` We only had four hours, so we had to strike a balance between the Olympics and his personal life. His mistress, who's still alive, was interviewed for the series. `` <PERSON> Brundage </PERSON> became an engineer and builder who put up much of the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> skyline. He was a handball champion when he was 60. Doctors kept telling him he was overworking, and he kept saying that other doctors who had told him that were all dead.'' The series also stars <PERSON> Sybil </PERSON> <PERSON> Maas </PERSON> as his wife, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, <PERSON> Renee </PERSON> <PERSON> Soutendijk </PERSON> as his mistress, <PERSON> Linnea </PERSON> <PERSON> Dresden </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kristoffer </PERSON> <PERSON> Tabori </PERSON> as his alcoholic younger brother, <PERSON> Chester </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> as his mother, <PERSON> Minnie </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Shelagh </PERSON> <PERSON> McLeod </PERSON> as his secretary, <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Blakely </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Philips </PERSON> directed from a screenplay by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>. <PERSON> Selby </PERSON> was born and raised in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, where his family has a farm that has been in the family since 1660. `` The place was totally self-sufficient,'' he says. `` We raised all of our own food, had a cherry and apple orchard and a little coal mine where we got enough coal to heat the farm. An uncle on the next farm had a dairy. My parents still live in a house in <LOCATION> Morgantown </LOCATION> built with timber grown on the farm and made into lumber in our own sawmill.'' At the university, <PERSON> Selby </PERSON> became so consumed by acting that at one point he quit school to go to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` I had $ 25 in my pocket and the first thing I did was pay $ 19 for a ticket to ` The Sound of Music,''' he says. `` I went back to college with my tail between my legs.'' After graduation, he spent eight months with the famous Barter Theater in <LOCATION> Abbingdon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, then nine months at the <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Playhouse </ORGANIZATION>. `` The Barter Theater was originally founded on the barter system,'' he says. `` One day a girl came and traded two cats for a ticket. I kept that calico cat for 19 years. I named her <PERSON> Safronia </PERSON> <PERSON> Clandon </PERSON> <PERSON> Selby </PERSON>.'' When he finally moved to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to stay he not only began to get parts on the stage but landed a role as a werewolf in the campy soap opera `` Dark Shadows.'' <PERSON> Selby </PERSON> was in such movies as `` Rich and Famous,'' `` Up the Sandbox,'' `` Supercops,'' `` Rich Kids'' and `` Raise the Titanic.'' `` I had been commuting to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> for years for film roles and made the move about five years ago,'' he says. `` I needed to change directions. I was n't getting the right film roles. One day I got a call from <LOCATION> Lorimar </LOCATION>. They needed a new character for ` <LOCATION> Flamingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION>.' I only did a few shows and it was canceled. `` By then <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamner </PERSON> was doing ` Falcon Crest.' I had known him from working on ` The <ORGANIZATION> Waltons </ORGANIZATION>.' He said I was the only character to ever kiss Mrs. <PERSON> Walton </PERSON>. Earl and I got along good. We told the same stories. So Earl created the part of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Channing </PERSON> for me and I joined the show in its second season.'''

 <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> has some tips for the audiences watching her latest dream-like _ some would say nightmarish _ experimental theater production, `` Miracolo d'Amore.'' `` It should be looked at the way one listens to music or the way one would look at a symbolist or surreal painting, or interpreted the way one might a stream-of-consciousness poem, where it is highly imagistic and maybe metaphysical,'' says the show's creator. `` Miracolo d'Amore,'' which has 15 performers, played in May at the Spoleto Festival in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, then opened June 14 at the off-Broadway Public Theater here. Most <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> performances have been sold out. Men wear the white costumes and tall caps of <PERSON> Tiepolo </PERSON>'s Punchinello drawings At the beginning, women are nude and playing a circle game denoting innocence. Their costumes make them look like flowers, based on sketches by <PERSON> J.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grandville </PERSON>. There is singing and talking, in pidgin Italian, embraces with a skeleton, loneliness, gang rape, fighting. `` I meant the title -LRB- `` The Miracle of Love'' -RRB- ironically,'' Miss <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> says. Miss <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> is known for experimental theater pieces, a succession of scenes, usually around an hour in length, inspired by art and culture, where theatergoers' ideas of what she `` meant'' vary widely. `` Miracolo d'Amore,'' is her least-literal, she says, and it may be her last. `` I think it's a difficult piece for people,'' she says. `` They ca n't come out being able to say exactly what it is. It has to be a subjective experience for the viewer, because it is an emotional work and it is a sad work. It's kind of a meditation on love gone wrong. `` The people who do n't get it at all are angered by it and dismiss it. I think it makes them frustrated. I'm afraid I always feel in trouble with people looking for literal or intellectual ideas in my work. `` Of the people who like it, somewhere it touches a deep emotional response in their own minds or dreams. People can be open to it and not feel they have to understand in a literal sense. Dreams have magic.'' `` The Garden of Earthly Delights'' in 1984 was Miss <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON>'s interpretation of a <PERSON> Hieronymous </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosch </PERSON> painting of heaven and hell It had dancers flying over the audience on wires. `` <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>: Lusthaus'' in 1986 showed the elegance and decadence, in which one might see seeds of fascism, of <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> at the turn of the century. `` The Hunger Artist'' in 1987 was taken from starvation in <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Kafka </PERSON>'s writings and emotional starvation of his life. Miss <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> started `` Miracolo d'Amore'' a year and a half ago. `` It went in an unpredictable direction,'' she says. `` You never know where they're going till you've gotten there. I read a lot of <PERSON> Italo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calvino </PERSON> fairy tales, to be inhabited by <PERSON> Punchinellos </PERSON> and these flower fairies. The stories were very dark, horrifying, funny _ and impossible to translate to stage. I gave up on them real quickly. And <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> seemed glutted with fairy tales at the time. `` Then I just started working with my company in improvising themes on primal emotions. There are elements of fairytale in it but fractured and shattered.'' She is n't working on another one. `` I do n't want to do this any more,'' she says. `` It's not a matter of success or failure. It's a matter of my own growth not to stay still and repeat. I want to explore and direct opera next. I want to get into film directing _ specific, literal stories. I'm now ready to go linear.'' In July, she went to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to talk to <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> about possibly doing movement for a co-production planned by the Glyndebourne Opera Festival and the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> Grand Opera. `` It is a discussion, not a job, at this point,'' she says. Miss <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> studied modern dance at the <ORGANIZATION> Juilliard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, was a member of <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Sokolow </PERSON>'s dance company for three years, then the Philobolus Dance Theater from 1972 to'78. She founded her own dance company, <LOCATION> Crowsnest </LOCATION>, before moving into experimental theater. She lives in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, divorced from sculptor <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Grausman </PERSON>. Her son, <PERSON> David </PERSON>, is 19 and studies jazz composition. `` Garden,'' probably her best-known work, was revived off-Broadway in 1987. It has been on tour and will tour again next year. `` <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>'' will tour this fall to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Pascali's Island''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Basil Pascali is an informer by profession. He lives alone on the eastern <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> island of Nisi, an outpost of <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s crumbling Ottoman Empire For years he has earned a small stipend for writing regular letters to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s sultan, reporting news, gossip and potential dangers to the government. To Pascali's great distress, he never receives a reply. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Kingsley </PERSON> portrays the frustrated spy in `` Pascali's <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>,'' and it is another superior chracterization for him, more complex and human than his Academy Award-winning `` Gandhi. Kinglsey, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Dance </PERSON>, <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirrin </PERSON> and a largely British cast create a fascinating tale of intrigue and duplicity. The writer-director is <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Dearden </PERSON>, who wrote `` Fatal Attraction.'' He adapted <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Unsworth </PERSON>'s novel with equal skill and makes his feature-film debut as director with `` Pascali's Island. <PERSON> Deardon </PERSON> had directed a short film, `` Diversions,'' which he expanded into `` Fatal Attraction.'' The film, like the novel, is told through Pascali's eyes. He is ever alert to newcomers on the island, and he offers his services to urbane Britisher <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowles </PERSON> -LRB- Dance -RRB-, who claims to be an archeologist. Pascali soon divines that <PERSON> Bowles </PERSON> has other motives than searching for ancient artifacts. The visitor also has eyes for a painter -LRB- Mirrin -RRB-, with whom <PERSON> Pascali </PERSON> has secretly been in love for years. The cast of characters is as varied and devious as any since <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Huston </PERSON>'s conspirators in `` The Maltese Falcon'' and `` Beat the Devil.'' Everyone has an angle, whether it is Dance, who is attempting a confidence scheme; the pasha, who is looking for graft; the American, who is supplying arms to rebels; or the German, who is seeking to extend his country's empire. Pascali perceives it all, and he sends his impassioned reports to the sultan. No answer. Ever the informer, <PERSON> Pascali </PERSON> finally brings a crushing climax to the con man's game. It is a violent and disconcerting finale, inevitable perhaps, but jarring. <PERSON> Kingsley </PERSON> continues to amaze with his capacity for assuming the skin of his characters. Dance is perfectly cast as the charming scoundrel, and <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirrin </PERSON> is seductive as well as cerebral. `` Pascali's Island'' was filmed on the Greek island of <LOCATION> Simi </LOCATION> and on the island of <LOCATION> Rhodes </LOCATION>, and their deep-blue coasts and winding streets are depicted with rare beauty by cinematographer <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Deakins </PERSON> -LRB- `` <PERSON> Sid </PERSON> and Nancy'' -RRB-. The Avenue Pictures release was produced by <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Fellner </PERSON>. The rating is PG-13, with some bedroom and bathhouse scenes. Running time: 101 minutes.

 Hold onto your machetes, folks, and do n't let your goalie masks down. <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>'s back. That human slice-and-dice machine who put <ORGANIZATION> Camp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crystal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> on the map will be in your video stores in seven movies that have grossed over $ 172 million: The `` Friday the 13th'' series. Paramount Home Video will have a package this fall featuring the first six movies in the series at a special $ 19.95 price. `` Friday the 13th Part VII _ The New Blood'' will sell for $ 89.95 in VHS and $ 29.95 in beta. <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> began his rampageous career quite modestly in 1980, in a low-budget thriller created by producer-director <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON>. Ironically, <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON> devised the title when he was planning a children's TV show. He thought it might work for the title of a feature film, and `` Friday the 13th'' grossed an amazing $ 40 million. The action takes place at <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Crystal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> returns from the dead, wearing a goalie mask and wielding an ax or machete to pay back a grudge. Many years ago when he was a camper he drowned in the lake because his inattentive counselors were making love in the bushes. <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>'s vengeance is wreaked upon the human race in general, but he takes special delight in whacking oversexed counselors. Videos reviewed this week: `` Raw'' and `` For Keeps.''

 `` Raw'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION>; VHS _ $ 89.95, Beta _ $ 29.95; Rated R -RRB- `` Raw'' is the technical result of an <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> performance at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Felt Forum, and it is aptly titled. It seems that <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> went to the <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> school of comedy and emerged with a doctorate in dirtyspeak. The video opens at a family Thanksgiving gathering in the 1960s. After dinner, a few of the youngsters give a talent show for their adoring parents. <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> the child tells a scatological joke, raising eyebrows from the grownups and providing a fast seque to 1987 and his stage show. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>'s routines are pat and almost formula by now, with predictable swipes at women, marriage, sex, homosexuals and various ethnic groups. Occasionally, he's funny. He gives a great imitation of <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON>, who allegedly called him on the phone one day to tell him that dirty words do not a comic make. He also does good impersonations of Mr. T and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>. `` Raw,'' however, is strictly for connoisseurs of <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>'s brash narcissism

 `` For Keeps'' -LRB- RCA @ <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> Home Video; VHS @ Beta, $ 89.95; Rated PG-13 -RRB- <PERSON> Darcy </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliot </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bobrucz </PERSON> are on top of the world: They're madly in love with a sun-filled future She's an aspiring writer who's about to get on the college newspaper, and he's waiting for a scholarship so he can go to <LOCATION> Cal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tech </LOCATION>. Everything is as rosy as life can be for bubbly, optimistic teen-agers. Then <PERSON> Darcy </PERSON> becomes pregnant. Rather than go through with an abortion and continue chasing her goals, <PERSON> Darcy </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Ringwald </PERSON> -RRB- decides to have the baby and marry <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Batinkoff </PERSON> -RRB-. Their idea of marriage, though, is as idyllic as a TV sitcom: neither realizes the realities, and they face financial tortures, social snubs and a crumbling relationship. <PERSON> Darcy </PERSON> is not allowed to complete her senior year in high school and must take an adult education class at night; <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> gets his scholarship but decides to turn it down so he can work in a shoe store and be a father. By the time the baby comes, <PERSON> Darcy </PERSON> does n't even want to hold it In the end, all works out through some personal sacrifice and a lot of growing up. Directed by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvidsen </PERSON>, `` For Keeps'' is surprisingly good, escaping the silliness that usually invades movies about teen social problems. Alvidsen is lean and focuses on the harsh realities and the human, comic gifts that get most people through a crisis. `` For Keeps'' is especially good viewing for those teen-agers who think that having a baby _ with or without a marriage _ is a nifty idea. They'll quickly learn what dicey really means.

 `` Panther -LRB- Yauarete -RRB-'' -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Nascimento </PERSON> <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Nascimento </PERSON> has a unique ability to combine primitive, folk-like melodies with sophisticated, jazz-inspired harmonies. The result is music of unusual depth and complexity, with moods ranging from jubilant to mournful. `` Yauarete'' contains a diverse collection of Nascimento's latest compositions It can be listened to either as a showcase of those compositions, or as the evocative performance of one of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s most moving singers. On the one hand, the freshness and originality of the 11 songs on the album attest to <PERSON> Nascimento </PERSON>'s seemingly inexhaustible creative energy and the breadth of his talent. `` Meu Mestre Coracao -LRB- Heart Is My Master -RRB-,'' a deftly engaging bossa nova, follows a meditative excursion entitled `` Cidade Encantada -LRB- Enchanted City -RRB-.'' `` Cancoes E Moments -LRB- Songs and Moments -RRB-'' is a short, repeating refrain that <PERSON> Nascimento </PERSON> has recently used as a closing number during live performances, leaving the audience quietly singing it as he and the band gradually drift offstage. Each song on the record is different, and each reveals another facet of Nascimento's compositional skill Even if <PERSON> Nascimento </PERSON> had n't written the songs, however, this album would be remarkable merely for his performances. His voice is rough but powerful, and it is often tinged with a bittersweet longing. With one exception, the songs on `` Yauarete'' are sung in Portuguese, but the feeling in <LOCATION> Nascimento </LOCATION>'s voice carries across the language barrier. <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> has, however, printed English translations alongside the Portuguese lyrics on the album's inner sleeve. -LRB- Nascimento works closely with several lyricists who generally supply the words to go with his music. -RRB-

<HEAD>Star Watch: 1988 Is the Year of Barbara Hershey</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After winning two consecutive best-actress awards from the <ORGANIZATION> Cannes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Hershey </PERSON> seems ready for what her supporters believe is an overdue nod from the <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>. It could have happened last year as the bayou mother in `` Shy People,'' for which she won her first <LOCATION> Cannes </LOCATION> prize. But as she herself admits, nobody saw the picture. This year <PERSON> Hershey </PERSON> was co-winner for her portrayal as the anti-apartheid activist in `` A World Apart.'' That could be her run for an Academy Award. Or maybe, if the Academy voters dare, as <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Magdalene </PERSON> in `` The Last Temptation of Christ.'' Or maybe for a comedy role in `` Beaches,'' which she is now filming with <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Midler </PERSON>. In any case, 1988 appears to be the year of <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Hershey </PERSON>. She has been in films since her debut in 1968 with <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> in `` With Six You Get Eggroll.'' <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> refused to take her seriously after she became <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Seagull </PERSON> during a free-form liaison with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Carradine </PERSON>, which resulted in a son, named Free. Still, she had a series of impressive performances in `` Last Summer,'' `` The Baby Maker,'' `` Box Car Bertha'' and `` The Stunt Man.'' Producers began to take notice with `` The Right Stuff'' and `` The Natural.'' But her real turning point was <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>'s `` <PERSON> Hannah </PERSON> and Her Sisters. `` That put me on those terrible lists,'' she remarked, referring to the film world's elite of `` bankable'' stars. `` All of a sudden I was OK to hire.'' Typical of <LOCATION> Hershey </LOCATION>, she continues accepting non-mainstream films and devoting excessive time to research them. For `` Shy People,'' she traveled to the backwater bayous of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and studied the Cajun speech and lifestyle. For `` A World Apart,'' she interviewed relatives and friends of <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> First </PERSON>, her character in the film. First, a journalist and political activist, was imprisoned in 1963 under <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 90-day Detention Act, the first white woman to be so punished. The script was written by <PERSON> Shawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Slovo </PERSON>, who is portrayed in the film as a 13-year-old girl. First remained an activist in exile, and in 1982 was killed by a letter bomb. `` She was a great woman, but she was n't an easy woman to those around her,'' said the actress at the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION> canyon home she shares with her son, now called <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>. `` The fascinating thing I found in all my interviews was that each person had different views of her. That confounded me but ultimately liberated me. `` I realized sadly that I could n't please them all. I decided to take what I thought would say the most. She was a complicated person, and my admiration for her grew and grew. `` One of the things I loved about her was that she loved to dress. Even in prison she wanted lipstick over food. It was very important for her to look elegant and have her hair done, contrary to our usual views of activists. She loved to wear dark glasses. Even working at her typewriter late at night, she wore dark glasses.'' Like <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Attenborough </PERSON>'s `` Cry Freedom,'' `` A World Apart'' was filmed in <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>. Conditions were primitive, but <PERSON> Hershey </PERSON> did n't complain: `` That fused with what we were doing; I kind of welcomed the adverse conditions.'' The actress is well aware of the growing furor over `` The Last Temptation of Christ,'' which has been attacked by religious fundamentalists as being potentially sacrilegious and blasphemous. `` I guess it was the greatest experience of my life so far,'' <PERSON> Hershey </PERSON> said. `` The film meant so much to me and so much to <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Scorsese </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-. Like things that mean so much, it's a little sad to talk about. I have n't seen it. But my feelings about it are that it must be great, simply great. `` I read the book by -LRB- <PERSON> Nikos </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Kazantzakis </PERSON> when I was 20, and it became my favorite book. I was moved, as I never had been before, by the Christ story. I finally got it. To get to make it after all these years is really something. `` If you do n't like the book, I do n't think you'll like the film,'' she said. `` All I can say is that I know why we made the film: We made it not to thumb our noses at anybody or anybody's religion Quite the opposite. We made it because we were moved by the book. It became a passion for <PERSON> Marty </PERSON>. I hope other people are moved, too. `` I find it ironic that the fundamentalists would object. I find it a very tende and moving version of the Christ story.'' She was born <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Herzst </PERSON> 40 years ago in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>. Her family nicknamed her <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON>, after the great actress <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernhardt </PERSON>, because she was always acting. She spent hours before a mirror, practicing expressions of <PERSON> Annette </PERSON>, <PERSON> Darlene </PERSON> and other members of `` The <ORGANIZATION> Mickey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>.'' Even before graduation from <ORGANIZATION> Hollywood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> she was appearing in such TV series as `` Gidget,'' `` The Monroes'' and `` The Farmer's Daughter. At 20 she played a liberated young woman in `` Last Summer,'' and she continued the role in her life with <PERSON> Carradine </PERSON>. It has taken a long time to shake that 1970s image, but now's managed and has caught the industy's eye

<HEAD>The Artists: Soviet Non-Conformist Art Makes Its Mark</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CATHERINE CROCKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In one of 10 rooms in the cramped and dreary communal apartment, a man escapes from his windowless existence in a novel way _ a contraption catapults him into space, and freedom. The `` apartment'' is a piece of art based on the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> flat in which artist <PERSON> Ilya </PERSON> <PERSON> Kabakov </PERSON> grew up, but it has no Soviet address. Instead, these full-scale rooms were built in an art gallery in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Soho </LOCATION> section. And to some, the fact that <PERSON> Kabakov </PERSON>'s art reached <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> at all is every bit as remarkable as the device that propelled his character, `` The Man Who Flew Into Space.'' `` Under ` glasnost,' all of a sudden, you can buy this work out of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON>, whose gallery _ after a decade of trying _ recently exhibited the <PERSON> Kabakov </PERSON> installation, entitled `` Ten Characters.'' `` I think that this change can not be underestimated. They -LRB- the Soviet government -RRB- do it for several reasons. They do it to earn hard currency. But at the same time they obviously are learning not to be afraid of their own intelligentsia, of their own creative people.'' In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where interest in things Soviet is growing, art dealers are leaping at the chance to show and market Soviet art rarely seen outside the artists' studios, let alone outside their country. Under the leadership of <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is no longer making a clear distinction between `` official'' artists who bow to socialist realism's glorification of state and worker, and `` unofficial'' artists, such as <PERSON> Kabakov </PERSON>, who do n't. Until recently, Western art dealers had to rely on smuggling and gifts to bring non-conformist art from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to their galleries, said <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bludeau </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> SOVART </LOCATION>, a private firm that promotes Soviet artists in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Now dealers negotiate directly with Soviet officials to launch exhibits. In putting together the <PERSON> Kabakov </PERSON> exhibition, <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> said he dealt with the Soviet Ministries of Trade and Culture. The price of each work of art to be sold in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> is negotiated with the government. If a painting sells for $ 10,000, about $ 4,000 goes to the gallery and $ 6,000 to the artist, of which the government takes $ 3,000, <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> explained. But before the state remits an artist's $ 3,000 share, the money is changed into rubles at the low, official rate A few blocks north of <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON>'s gallery, the <ORGANIZATION> Eduard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nakhamkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gallery </ORGANIZATION> has exhibited the works of Soviet artists <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Yankilevsky </PERSON> and <PERSON> Viatcheslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalinin </PERSON>. The Phyllis Kind Gallery plans a Soviet exhibition this fall. <PERSON> Kabakov </PERSON>'s work ranges from $ 50,000 to $ 100,000 for one of his rooms. Most of <PERSON> Kalinin </PERSON>'s paintings have sold for at least $ 30,000. <PERSON> Yankilevsky </PERSON>'s work ranges from $ 2,000 for an etching to about $ 80,000 for a painting. Although Soviet non-conformist art is being actively sought by dealers, collectors and museums in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, it is still gathering dust in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Artists such as <PERSON> Kabakov </PERSON> _ who supports himself as an illustrator in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> _ have few opportunities to exhibit and sell their work there. `` The Russian Ministry of Culture does n't mind for them to be exhibited outside and be successful _ but still very cautious inside <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Nakhamkin </PERSON>, a Soviet emigre who came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> 13 years ago and now owns five galleries in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Even inside the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, however, change is in the offing. <PERSON> Kabakov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yankilevsky </PERSON> were among the contemporary Soviet artists whose work was recently sold by <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s at the first international art auction in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> since 1917. Foreigners spent more than $ 3 million at the sale. In addition to 100 works by 29 living artists, 18 paintings by five artists from the <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> avant-garde period of 1910-40 were on the block. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodchenko </PERSON>'s 1920 painting, `` Line,'' topped the bidding at $ 567,000; <PERSON> Grisha </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruskin </PERSON>'s 1986 work, `` Fundamental Lexicon,'' was sold for $ 416,000. Works of the Russian avant-garde also will be featured at an exhibition at the Russian Museum in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> in the fall. Much of the art has been kept from public view since 1932 when Soviet officials decreed it was alien to the nation's cultural goals. In the spirit of `` glasnost,'' a catalog of the exhibition, entitled `` Soviet Art 1920-1930, From the Russian Museum, <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>,'' is being co-published by <ORGANIZATION> Harry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abrams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Sovietsky </PERSON> <PERSON> Khudozhnik </PERSON>, the Soviet publishing house for artists. Included in the exhibition and book are the works of <LOCATION> Kasimir </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Malevich </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wassily </PERSON> <PERSON> Kandinsky </PERSON>, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodchenko </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pavel </PERSON> <PERSON> Filonov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Tatlin </PERSON>. Loneliness and alienation are common themes in the art emerging from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` Ten Characters'' is about `` little men,'' and the contrast between their `` boring and cold outer world'' and their `` very intensive, very colorful inner life,'' said <PERSON> Kabakov </PERSON>, 54, through his friend and interpreter, <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkel </PERSON>, an artist who emigrated from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> 10 years ago. Each of the 10 rooms of the communal apartment is home to a different fictive character. The room occupied by `` The Man Who Never Threw Anything Away'' is filled with carefully cataloged bits of trash. There's also the collector's room, where the walls are decorated with an array of colorful postcards, and the short man's room which has a labyrinth of knee-high drawings across the floor. Through his characters' quirky passions _ documented by the objects in their rooms and a text which accompanies the installation _ the artist reveals humor, passion and color, even beauty. <PERSON> Kabakov </PERSON> insists that the installation is not about life in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> but is a metaphor for human experience in general. `` Differences between the outer world and inner world exist in all social systems,'' he said. However, when <PERSON> Perkel </PERSON> first saw the room with the catapult, he thought, `` ` I ca n't stay there, in that room, particularly in that country. I have to get out of that room.' So that's the reason I'm here I emigrated 10 years ago. ... I just catapulted myself to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' At the other end of the Soviet art spectrum is <PERSON> Kalinin </PERSON>, 50, who considers himself a follower of the realist painting of the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> School. He distorts the natural into absurdity and caricature, and dubs it `` fantastic realism.'' An unsympathetic feeling pervades his work, which features alcohol, guns, card-playing, wrinkled faces and abandoned buildings. `` Official people do n't like my art because I show the unpleasant side of life in <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>,'' he said, as <PERSON> Nakhamkin </PERSON> interpreted for him. But he added that he did not believe his work was negative. The Western romance with Soviet art is in full swing, <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> said, but its duration is unknown. But, he noted, `` The only thing that will last is good art.''

The songs are `` I'm Alright'' from `` Caddyshack'' in 1980; the title song of `` Footloose'' in 1984; and `` Danger Zone'' from `` Top Gun'' in 1986. His new single, `` Nobody's Fool,'' from `` Caddyshack II,'' is in the Top 40 and heading toward becoming his fourth Top 10 from a film. <PERSON> Loggins </PERSON>' new album, `` Back to Avalon'' is his first in three years. <PERSON> Loggins </PERSON> talked about his new album and career in an interview before beginning an American tour which will keep him on the road through Oct. 9. Here are highlights of that interview. Q. Why is `` Back to Avalon'' your first solo album in three years? A. I was asking myself that the other day. I guess time just sort of swept by. I wrote and recorded more songs for this album than the 10 or 11 I normally do. I recorded 16 or 17. I had a third child, a little girl, 8 months old, whose brothers are 7 and 6. We've been building a home in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> -RRB-. For those who've built homes, they know that can be consuming. And during that period I had two soundtrack songs, `` Meet Me Half Way'' in `` Over the Top'' and `` Danger Zone'' in `` Top Gun.'' Q. Is `` Back to Avalon'' about <LOCATION> Catalina </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>? A. No. Avalon's a mythical place which has to do with King Arthur's Court. The song is n't about King Arthur's Court. It's about a relationship that has been together awhile and started to drift apart The singer refers to the way love used to be as Avalon. They've got one last try to regain that feel of Avalon. Q. Do they? A. I have no idea. It's as if it was a scene of a movie. You only get to see the one scene; you do n't get to see the resolution. Quite often I get a visual idea and what I try to do is describe the scene and the emotion behind the scene, which is probably why I enjoy doing the soundtrack thing so much. They deliver up a scene for me and I try to find the emotion behind the scene and write the song to it. Q. Have you always written that way? A. Yes. There's always a moment in time that you freeze and you try to describe best that single emotion in that single moment. Q. What has been your most successful `` emotion behind a scene'' song? A. Possibly `` Forever,'' a hit of mine a couple of years ago. Or `` Back to Avalon.'' I like to think my writing gets better as I get older. Q. Are there disadvantages to being identified with movie songs? A. I do n't think there is any stigma to singing movie songs. The only thing I would worry about would be that radio would say, `` We're not going to play this any more.'' So far they're behind me. That's all that matters. I figure as long as it's a good song they'll play it. I do n't think I've compromised my writing to do it. I've been very fortunate that I've had such luck with it. Q. Can a hit song only come from a hit movie? A. I had a hit record, `` Meet Me Half Way,'' from a dog movie, Sly <PERSON> Stallone </PERSON>'s `` Over the Top.'' Q. Have you had any movie songs that did n't work out? A. I told the two guys doing `` Flashdance'' that I did n't have time to write and record for it; I was on the road. Within a few days of being on the road I fell off a stage in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and broke a couple of ribs. I was sent home. During the recuperation, I tried to put together a song for `` Flashdance.'' They liked it. I felt it was n't good enough and I pulled it, not realizing the movie was going to be one of the biggest summer movies in history. Q. Does your success with movie songs bring you lots of offers? A. I expected, once you had a few hits, they'd come looking for you. But for the most part you have to search them out. When I hear about a project that has got a buzz on it, I'll have my manager make some calls and see if they're interested in music and if I can get in to see a screening. Q. How did you start with movie songs? A. I wrote `` I Believe in Love,'' which Barbra Streisand sang in `` A Star Is Born,'' and met <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Streisand </PERSON>'s former companion -RRB-, who was producing. <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> called me for `` Caddyshack.'' They needed a theme song. I watched a rough cut, laughed a lot and wanted to be a part of it. Within a couple of days I'd written `` I'm Alright.'' But I was n't so sure when he called about `` Caddyshack II.'' I was a little skittish about trusting lightning to strike twice in the same place. Q. Have you written all the movie songs you've recorded? A. `` Danger Zone'' and `` Meet Me Half Way'' were both written by <PERSON> Georgio </PERSON> <PERSON> Moroder </PERSON>. The `` Footloose'' script was written by a friend of mine, lyricist <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitchford </PERSON>. We wrote `` Footloose'' and `` I'm Free'' together, which were in the movie He went on to collaborate on all the songs in the movie. Q. What were your thoughts when you turned 40 this year? A. You mean about suicide? I was a little depressed for a few days. When you're in rock' n' roll you do n't expect to turn 40.

 There are no sure things in <PERSON> Bobbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>'s stories, just endless possibilities `` I think in terms of possibility. It's part of my heritage,'' said <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, whose second novel is called `` Spence + Lila'' -LRB- <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> and Row, $ 12.95 -RRB-. <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lila </PERSON> <PERSON> Culpepper </PERSON> are a couple in their 60s who live on a farm in western <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>. They are brought together with their three children, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, when <PERSON> Lila </PERSON> is diagnosed as having breast cancer and must undergo surgery. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, a native of western <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, contrasts the lives of <LOCATION> Spence </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Lila </PERSON>, who have spent most of their lives on the farm, to those of the children, who have moved away. `` It's a very confusing time for people of that -LRB- the children's -RRB- generation,'' the author said. `` They're subject to so many influences and problems because of all the choices. They can get divorced; their parents could n't do that. So many influences, so much more money.'' While the children move around the country trying to find themselves, <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> is perfectly happy to stay on the farm. `` There's a passage where <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> is looking around the farm and thinking that everyone is breaking their necks trying to get something grand,'' <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said. `` For Spence, it's right here, on the farm. The basic facts of the universe are here: birth, growth and death. `` It is extraordinary to plant soy beans and harvest them.'' <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, born in 1940, can relate well to the Culpepper children. She grew up on a dairy farm near <LOCATION> Mayfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, and was the first member of her family to go college, taking journalism classes at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION>. She has also done her share of moving. After college, she lived in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and went to graduate school at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Binghamton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and the Uny

 ty of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. She now lives with her husband in rural <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>'s independence and thirst for adventure was inspired by the movies her parents took her to see as a child. `` They saw movies, but they did n't have the sense that they could just take off and go to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and go where the movies are,'' she said. `` It seemed possible for me to go out there.'' The radio also had an impact on the author. `` I first listened to rhythm and blues in the late'40s and early'50s,'' <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> recalled. `` That struck a very deep chord in me _ one of those formative things. I certainly had the longing and curiosity and wanting to experience new things. `` That's why I have <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> as a rock' n' roll fan.'' <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>'s first story was published in 1980. Two years later, she released `` Shiloh,'' a collection of short stories that won the PEN-Ernest Hemingway Award for first fiction. In 1985, she came out with her first novel, `` In Country'', the story of <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, a teen-ager trying to learn more about her late father, a <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> soldier killed before she was born. `` In Country,'' was a best seller. A film adaptation, starring the English actress <PERSON> Emily </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> as <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> as her uncle, is in progess. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> writes sparely, leaving much of the interpretation to the reader. She has been compared to such contemporary writers as <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Beattie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Carver </PERSON>, who have been called minimalists. While <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> admires <PERSON> Carver </PERSON> and <PERSON> Beattie </PERSON>, she rejects the idea of consciously emulating them. `` One does n't like to identify with labels. That means that you agree that you're part of a movement,'' she said. `` That's just me. I think in a certain decade; lots of people are going to sound similar.'' Describing <PERSON> Lila </PERSON>'s thoughts the night before her operation, <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> uses short, almost telegraphic sentences: `` Lila ca n't sleep. Random scenes pass before her eyes. The strong, comfortable smells of cows in the barn waiting to be milked, the steamy air in winter. Gathering in tomatoes before a frost. Sprinkling lime on the potatoes spread out on the ground in a stall of the barn. Laying the onions on screen-door racks above.'' <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> notes that the real meaning of her stories can be learned from the pacing of her writing, rather than the words themselves. `` Hardly anybody points out those things. The sentence rhythms mean everything because they create the tone and the voice and the characters.'' For `` Spence + <PERSON> Lila </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> sought to create a delicate mood. `` I wanted it be very calm and reflective and tender and deep. To go way inside. It's a love story.'' That's why she put a plus symbol in the title. After <PERSON> Lila </PERSON>'s surgery, she and <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> return to the farm. The books ends with this passage in the garden of <LOCATION> Spence </LOCATION> observing <LOCATION> Lila </LOCATION>: `` The way she laughs is the moment he has been waiting for. She rears her head back and laughs steadily, her throat working and her eyes flashing. Her throat catches her finally and slows her down, but her face dances like pond water in the rain, all unsettled and stirring with aroused possibility.'' `` Somebody said to me that the word ` possibility' is the key,'' <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said of the ending. `` Possibility is what there is.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Vanwarmer Album `Like Gathering Your Family'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Singer-songwriter <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanwarmer </PERSON> is counting on the emotional edge of his new album to stem a nine-year slide since his million-selling hit `` Just When I Needed You Most.'' The 33-year-old <PERSON> Vanwarmer </PERSON> has just released `` I Am,'' a collection of soft country ballads with romantic titles such as `` I Will Hold You,'' `` That's What Your Smile Does for Me'' and `` Words I Never Meant.'' It's his first album in four years. `` There's something spiritual about the record,'' <PERSON> Vanwarmer </PERSON> said in an interview. `` It's kind of like gathering your family around the fireplace.'' As a marketing exercise, however, it has been a disaster. Instead of <PERSON> Vanwarmer </PERSON>'s `` It's a Heartache,'' a tune by pop-jazz singer <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Franks </PERSON>, `` The Camera Never Lies,'' was distributed erroneously with <PERSON> Vanwarmer </PERSON>'s name printed on it. The mistake was repeated during a second round of distribution, so record company officials gave up on the song and will switch to another one, `` Where the Rocky Mountains Touch the Morning Sun.'' `` The radio stations kept calling and saying, ` We like <PERSON> Randy </PERSON>'s record but he's not country enough for our station,''' <PERSON> Vanwarmer </PERSON> said `` His record is kind of jazz, funky, but we have similar textured voices. I can almost understand why they almost thought it was me.'' His tough luck continues a pattern since his powerful `` Just When I Needed You Most'' propelled him from obscurity in 1979. Instead of establishing himself as a ballad singer, he followed up with an uptempo tune titled `` Got ta Get Out of Here.'' `` It did terribly,'' <PERSON> Vanwarmer </PERSON> recalled. More than half a dozen singles were released subsequently, but none was a hit. On the advice of others, he declined to do American concert tours that would have built up his name and following. A possible tour with <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> was bypassed. Furthermore, his record company wound down, `` and I do n't think they were putting the money behind the records that they needed to,'' he said. `` I do n't blame anybody,'' he said about the downfall. `` Maybe if I had been more knowledgeable. ... `` We had one solid record, and then we wanted to change direction _ something with a little more edge. I wanted to do it; that was just naivete. My first record seemed so easy. I do ballads best. We could have done another ballad, but we put out an uptempo thing.'' Though he failed to capitalize on the success of `` Just When I Needed You Most,'' he says his royalties from writing the hit paid the bills for six years. His breakup with his girlfriend inspired the song. `` That was kind of devastating,'' he recalled. Six months later, he sat down and put the song on paper. `` I found that those kind of songs, the deepest ones, come some time after an event. You're too traumatized at the time. When someone leaves, you just do n't go sit down and write a song. If you did, you'd almost wish bad things would happen to you.'' He said the song was a hit because listeners related to a lament over a broken romance. `` It's happened to everyone. That emotion is universal. Some people like to feel sorry for themselves,'' he said. `` I always hoped the record was n't wallowing in self pity and it had some redeeming value, and I guess it does.'' A footnote about the song is that <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sebastian </PERSON> of the rock group <ORGANIZATION> Lovin </ORGANIZATION>' Spoonful played autoharp on the record. `` To me, it was one of the things that sold the record,'' <PERSON> Vanwarmer </PERSON> said. In 1980, he wrote the song `` It Never Hurts to Hurt Sometimes,'' which later became a No. 1 hit for the Oak Ridge Boys. The song, triggered by the death of his father 13 years earlier, made its way to the charts in an unusual fashion. The song got into the hands of <ORGANIZATION> Oak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boys </ORGANIZATION>' record producer <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Chancey </PERSON>, whose wife fell in love with it after hearing it on a demonstration tape. It was then recorded by the group as a favor to her, <PERSON> Vanwarmer </PERSON> said. `` One perk of being a songwriter is exorcising your feelings as they come along,'' he said. `` And people can exorcise theirs as they listen too.'' He wrote it on Christmas Eve as he sat alone at home before gathering with family members. `` It was emotion from the heart. It wrote itself.''

<HEAD>Superconductivity Race Continues At Frantic Pace</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The first word came in a Japanese financial newspaper in January: <PERSON> Hiroshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> had found a superconductor that broke all previous temperature records. While legions of physicists struggled to decipher the Japanese and to duplicate <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON>'s feat, two newcomers at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> announced they had smashed his record. A few days later, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> scientists fiddling with the <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> superconductor in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, hit a high-temperature mark that still stands. All the pandemonium began with the January 1986 discovery by two <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> scientists in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, that a complicated mixture of lanthanum, barium, copper and oxygen could carry electricity with no resistance at 396 degrees below zero Fahrenheit. In the exotic landscape of physics, that was terribly warm. Before the `` Zurich oxide,'' as it's sometimes called, superconductors worked only at temperatures colder than minus 418 degrees, about 42 degrees above absolute zero. The <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> discovery impressed the <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> crowd. The scientists, <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON> and <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Georg </PERSON> <PERSON> Bednorz </PERSON>, received the 1987 Nobel Prize _ one of the fastest on record. Superconductivity almost seems to violate nature's laws. When electricity passes through ordinary conductors, some is inevitably converted into heat. Sometimes a lot of it _ as in your toaster. But not in superconductors. They carry electricity with no resistance _ and no heat loss. None. That's more than a scientist's idea of a parlor trick. These brittle ceramic metals could lead to zero-resistance electric power lines, exotic energy storage devices and other wonders. And no story on superconductivity would be complete without a mention of super-fast trains magnetically levitated over superconducting rails. The truth is, no one is quite sure where and when superconductors will turn up outside physics labs. Economists may be better forecasters than physicists. Mag-lev trains might work in lab tests, but who will pay to build them? Are utilities going to rip out serviceable power lines to put up superconductors? Not if they have to double or triple your electric bill to pay for it. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told a conference last year, `` There are predictions of high-speed trains levitated above their tracks, supercomputers on a single silicon chip, cheaper and more effective medical imaging devices.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said it's `` our business to discover ways to turn our dreams into history as soon as possible,'' but he wo n't foot the bill, either. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> budget for condensed-matter physics, which includes superconductivity, is $ 37.2 million this year, up just 0.5 percent. Such worldly concerns aside, physicists are silly with excitement. `` Somebody described scientists like pigeons,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>, a physicist at <ORGANIZATION> Brooklyn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>. `` You throw bread here and everybody pecks here. Then you throw bread over there and everybody pecks there.'' The record holders are the <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> researchers, led by <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, who pushed the threshhold to 234 degrees below zero Fahrenheit. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> and company surpassed the report by <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON> of superconductivity onset at minus 243 degrees. <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON> started with copper oxide _ or copper and oxygen, the common denominators in nearly all the new superconductors _ and added bismuth, strontium and calcium. Earlier compounds had contained yttrium instead of bismuth. Physicists soon were wearing buttons that read `` Sell yttrium _ buy bismuth.'' `` The last 18 months have been the most exciting in my life,'' <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said at the March meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> a year after the so-called `` Woodstock of physics'' in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. That was when most physicists got their first reports on the new superconductors. `` That was a once-in-a-lifetime event. It was incredible. Incredible. What else can I say?'' said <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, echoing others who were there. A `` Woodstock II'' session was held this year, with late reports on the superconductors discovered in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>. One of the stars was <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION>' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hermann </PERSON>. He and <PERSON> Zhengzhi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheng </PERSON> discovered the thallium-barium-copper-oxygen superconductor -LRB- to which they later added calcium -RRB- that holds the high temperature record set by <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hermann </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sheng </PERSON> reported superconductivity at minus 238 degrees, earning them a momentary record until <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> pushed their compound further. They since have matched his mark. How high the temperature record will go is anybody's guess. Scattered reports of superconductivity at room temperature have n't been confirmed, but many researchers believe room-temperature superconductivity may be possible Not all the action is in the glamorous search for new superconductors and the race for higher temperatures, however. Theorists _ the armchair physicists whose job is to think, not to concoct _ think they are beginning to understand how the new superconductors work. The key seems to be the arrangement of the copper oxide. Electron microscopes have shown that the copper and oxygen atoms arrange themselves in planes. The other elements serve as spacers, sandwiched between the planes. In some compounds, each plane is separated from its neighbors. In others the planes are paired, and in the newest the planes occur in threes. The more planes, the higher the temperature at which superconductivity occurs. At the moment, that's a mere observation. `` If we can go to four layers, we should be able to go to higher transition temperatures,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazen </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Geophysical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> D.C </ORGANIZATION>. The next question to be addressed is why it should be so, but physicists at last have a direction to go that's more than hunch, which is how they got where they are. Anyone can do it: Melt a few elements together, let the stew harden, cool it to frigid temperatures and see what happens. <PERSON> Hazen </PERSON> calls that `` shake and bake'' science, or `` cook and look.'' Of course, not everything is as simple as stacking planes. Just when physicists had become comfortable thinking about planes, a superconductor with no stacked planes was discovered. The mixture of potassium, barium, bismuth and oxygen became superconducting at about 406 degrees below zero, according to its discoverers at <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>. It's not a contender in the high-temperature race. But <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleury </PERSON>, one of the discoverers, said, `` There's a whole new ballfield that's opened up now.'' On another ballfield, <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, has produced a lanthanum-copper-oxygen superconductor with a simpler structure, but similar to the other copper-containing superconductors. It's a kind of superconductor building block, and <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> believes it's a contender. He thinks it could go superconducting at higher temperatures than <PERSON> Hermann </PERSON>'s thallium mix, and he's out to prove it. His first tests show superconductivity at minus 280 degrees Fahrenheit, but he's betting he can reach a toasty 100 degrees below zero. There is a catch. <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>'s simple superconductor is n't simple to make. It must be cooked at 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit and squeezed at 65,000 times normal atmospheric pressure. Fortunately for <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, once the material is made it can be cooled and studied at normal temperatures and pressures. `` Nature's been kind _ it's done something we never expected,'' said <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>. `` We never thought we'd be operating at these temperatures in our lifetime _ or ever.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Pressinger </PERSON>'s troubles began when he was teaching in a portable classroom built with particle board. His chest hurt, he could n't concentrate and he was depressed. He had frequent colds and an abnormally low white-blood cell count, indicating liver malfunction. Doctors could n't determine a cause for his symptoms. <PERSON> Pressinger </PERSON>'s suffering became so intense he finally left his girlfriend and gave up his job. He joined the <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> and went to teach in <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, but had to leave after a year because the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> began using a strong pesticide in the classrooms in which he taught. Suspecting sensitivity to chemicals, he began sleeping on a beach to escape the smells of pesticides, disinfectants, paint, and even perfume. Pressinger, 33, is one of a growing number of people who believe they are severely allergic to chemicals, victims of environmental illness. Doctors, however, ca n't agree on what is causing symptoms that have led some sufferers to seek a `` toxic free environment'' by giving up their jobs and moving to the desert or even going so far as to seal their rooms with aluminum foil linings. `` Much of what is attributed to environmental factors can only be theorized,'' says Dr. <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, clinical allergist and president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allergy </ORGANIZATION> and Immunology. `` So there is great controversy as to whether the precepts of the physicians practicing environmental medicine are valid, at this time.'' The burden of proof `` belongs on the physicians practicing the specialty,'' <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON> says. Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rae </PERSON>, a cardiovascular surgeon who also specializes in clinical ecology, says, `` Nothing is 100 percent proven. But most of the debate occurs out of ignorance ... It's a scapegoat for not looking into it critically.'' <PERSON> Rae </PERSON> contends that 10 percent to 20 percent of the population suffers from such sensitivity. His clinic in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> says it has treated 17,000 people for environmental illness in the past dozen years. Some of them are sensitive to formaldehyde in particle board, paneling and rugs, others to food or gasoline. Even the smell of deodorant, vehicle exhaust, newsprint, clothes, bedding and other everyday substances can cause reactions. Pressinger lives at his mother's home here, doing everything he can to avoid contact with chemicals. He believes his only real escape is a secluded, uninhabited island.

<HEAD>Researcher Says Prairie Dogs A Problem But Misunderstood</HEAD>

 Ranchers say prairie dogs do n't live up to that cute-sounding name. Prairie rodents is more like it, they grumble of the furry animals that chomp grass and booby-trap pastures with their burrows. Zoologist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoogland </PERSON> admits the critters cause problems but says they're basically misunderstood. Much of what he says flies in the face of lore. `` Prairie dogs will expand unless they are controlled, said <PERSON> Verne </PERSON> <PERSON> Brakke </PERSON>, director of regulatory services for the state <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Not so, said <PERSON> Hoogland </PERSON>. In fact, in a behavior pattern observed in fewer than a dozen other species, prairie dog mothers leave their own pups unguarded to enter the burrows of female relatives where they kill and eat the babies. `` The implications of this are enormous,'' he said. `` There seems to be a system in which the prairie dogs are controlling themselves.'' <PERSON> Hoogland </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION>, has been watching prairie dogs in one colony in Wind Cave National Park since 1975, and the population has stayed around 150. `` That colony has not expanded 1 inch,'' he said. The killings at first went unnoticed because they occurred in burrows, then <PERSON> Hoogland </PERSON> noticed that females visiting other burrows would emerge with blood on their fur. The evidence was uncovered when a burrow was excavated. `` Fifty-one percent of all litters are killed by infanticide,'' he said, adding that the common perpetrator is a female relative, though in a few cases the mother turns on her own litter. Litters average two to three pups. `` The leading candidate is that they are doing it for food,'' he said. `` I have never seen them eat any other meat. `` Maybe in other colonies there are certain things we could do to make the prairie dogs control themselves.'' Ranchers wo n't shed tears over the deaths of prairie dog pups. Since the 1800s, when pioneers and their cattle moved west, it's been war `` Back in the early 1900s at one point the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government hired 125,000 people whose only job was to eradicate prairie dogs,'' <PERSON> Hoogland </PERSON> said. Those efforts continue today in states like <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Brakke </PERSON>. Most states have animal damage offices, but anti-prairie dog efforts are not coordinated from state to state. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> had 800,000 acres of prairie dog towns in 1980. Today that is down to 250,000 to 300,000, <PERSON> Brakke </PERSON> said. No figures are available on the amount of land infested nationwide, but millions of acres are involved, he said. `` They are a rodent. We give them kind of a cute and furry little attribute, so we call them prairie dogs. If we called them prairie rats or prairie rodents there would n't be that connotation,'' he said. `` I grew up with a dislike, a distaste and an aboslute hate for prairie dogs,'' said state Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Marvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogen </PERSON>. `` The bread of life in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> is grass, and those little buggers eat grass, and the second thing is they make holes that your horse can step in and break his leg.'' <PERSON> Hoogland </PERSON> said it's hard to find examples of that, and added, `` Everybody hates prairie dogs but almost nothing was known about them. Ranchers say, ` Look what they've done to my land,' but there's a lot of evidence that prairie dogs move into areas that have already been overgrazed. `` I'm not saying there's no competition -LRB- with livestock -RRB- but I'm saying all the evidence is n't in yet Two hundred years ago there were jillions of prairie dogs and jillions of buffalo, so they could coexist.''

<HEAD>Researchers Seek Biodegradable Plastic Nets, Lobster Traps</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Forget about mice. Researchers here are working on a better lobster trap _ one that lets the lobsters escape. Prompted by what they say are the needless deaths of 200,000 lobsters a year when wooden traps break free of buoys and the lobsters starve, chemists at <ORGANIZATION> Stevens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> are trying out biodegradable plastic. They have buried 16 plastic compounds in the seabed along the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> coast, and will study the compounds this month, says <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonsolves </PERSON>, a chemical engineer at <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' Polymer Processing Institute. The aim is to replace one or two of the slats in traditional traps with plastic that would deteriorate within a few months, letting lobsters break out, <PERSON> Gonsolves </PERSON> said. Wood traps take a year or more to deteriorate underwater. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> is working with the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maritime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consortium </ORGANIZATION>, an alliance of <LOCATION> Mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> colleges, under a $ 187,000 grant from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Florida To Have Universe's Coldest Spot In New Physics Lab</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Physicists who want to study the rotation of atoms hope to make them stand still by turning a lab in the Sunshine State into the coldest spot in the universe. The <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Microkelvin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lab </ORGANIZATION> will open in the early fall, and physicist <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ihas </PERSON> said, `` It is designed to take matter closer to absolute zero than it has ever been before. We'll be able to get to within one-millionth of a degree of absolute zero _ to one microkelvin.'' Absolute zero, the theoretical point at which even the atoms in matter stop moving around, is minus 459.67 degrees Fahrenheit, or zero on the <PERSON> Kelvin </PERSON> scale. `` The coldest temperature in the universe, in the empty space betweeen galaxies, is about 3 degrees <PERSON> Kelvin </PERSON>, so this will be roughly 3 million times colder than that,'' <PERSON> Ihas </PERSON> said. `` At extremely low temperatures, atoms slow to such an extent that you can look at very small interactions, you can study the motion between the particles themselves,'' <PERSON> Ihas </PERSON> said. `` Looking at things in that way allows you to understand the laws of physics in basic, deeper ways.'' The lab, supported by a $ 1.3 million <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> grant and private funds, consists of three 41-foot-deep pits to house cryostats, shielded refrigeration units. Footsteps can raise temperatures 500 microkelvin, so huge shock absorbers will isolate the cryostats and an electromagnetic shield will deflect radio waves and other electrical disturbances. The lab's chief purpose is research, but <PERSON> Ihas </PERSON> said, `` There are always spinoffs that are unpredictable ... not because we understand the new physics and apply it, but because we stumble on to something, because of serendipity.'' One problem, he said, will be that `` since no one has really been this cold, we do n't know what kind of thermometer is going to work.''

<HEAD>Task Force Finds Slight Increase In Grizzly Bear Population</HEAD>
<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thirteen years after the grizzly bear was declared to be a threatened species, its population in the <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> area now is growing, according to a task force of scientists. The scientists said they ca n't pinpoint the number of grizzlies because the ecosystem comprises 9,600 very rugged square miles but, there were at least 45 adult females in 1985, up from 32 in 1983. They figure 170 to 180 bears lived in the area and the population is growing 0.07 percent to 1.5 percent a year. `` This increase is partially a result of grizzly bear management programs,'' said the task force appointed by the <ORGANIZATION> Interagency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grizzly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. It cited the increase as cause for cautious optimism, noting `` The recovery and survival of the grizzly bear in the Yellowstone ecosystem will require continued careful management.'' The grizzly bear has been protected since 1975 under the federal Endangered Species Act.

With factories operating near capacity and unemployment at a 14-year low, `` you see the possibility of inflation breaking out all over, the genie getting out of the bottle,'' said <PERSON> Allvine </PERSON>, who has headed <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION>'s stock marketing forecasting project for nine years. Four of <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION>'s five market computer analyses `` have reached a negative threshold which has been associated with ultimate downturns on the market,'' <PERSON> Allvine </PERSON> said. `` Last year the economy was running very strong, there were inflationary concerns and the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- was compelled to hold a steady course on liquidity, which ultimately led to the very speculative stock market,'' he said. `` Our numbers on our <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> models are showing that both the short-term and long-term -LRB- interest -RRB- rates are becoming very close to where they were a year ago at this time,'' <PERSON> Allvine </PERSON> said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is snugging up in terms of its action to see that the economy does not run away,'' he said. `` If this does not work and interest rates continue to rise, there could be another crumble in the stock market.'' Inflation has been a major concern of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>, which tries to keep the economy stable by manipulating the supply of money in circulation. The gloomy analysis is based on the fact short term rates are higher, with the federal funds rate, the interest for overnight borrowing by banks, as high as it was on Oct. 19, the day of the crash, <PERSON> Allvine </PERSON> said. The fed funds rate, which stood at 7.625 percent when the market collapsed, was quoted at just over 7.75 percent on Friday. `` Other interest rates are up sharply from the beginning of the year, and some are higher than at the time of the crash,'' <PERSON> Allvine </PERSON> said. In 1987, the prime rate rose from 7.75 percent in March to 9.25 percent two weeks before the market crashed. It stands now at 9.5 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s discount rate, the interest rate it charges member banks for loans, was increased from 5.5 percent to 6 percent a month before the crash and remains at that level.

<HEAD>China Enacts Law Giving More Power to Enterprises</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on Monday enacted a law that ends direct state controls over enterprises and gives factory managers greater freedom over their operations. The introduction of the enterprise law came with warnings that factories will no longer be able to live off state largess and will face bankruptcy if they fail to respond to market competition. The law, passed by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last April, gives factory managers greater autonomy over planning and personnel and makes them responsible for profits and losses. It is to be followed in November by enactment of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s first bankruptcy law, which will set down rules for shutting down insolvent plants. Legalization of the manager responsibility system, already widely practiced in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s state-run factories, has been hailed as a major step in the government's drive to reduce the role of central planning and make industry more efficient by linking its production to market-determined supply and demand factors. <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> <PERSON> Yanning </PERSON>, deputy minister of the state commission for restructuring the economy, said last week government departments that previously exercised direct control over industries should abide by the principle of `` the state regulates the market, which in turn guides the enterprises.'' Several years of experimenting with the manager responsibility system, however, has proved the difficulty of following that principle. Factory managers are still at the mercy of state allocations departments that control disbursement of scarce and increasingly expensive energy and raw materials. Managers told they now must make profits are also thwarted by irrationally low state-set purchasing prices for many of their products. Approximately one-fourth of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s state-run enterprises are operating in the red, and the number is increasing with recent sharp increases in the costs of raw materials. The People's Daily, the official voice of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said in a front-page commentary Monday that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s 10-year-old economic structural reforms have `` entered a critical stage.'' Enterprises can no longer harbor the illusion that the state will provide low-priced raw materials and subsidies to cover losses, it said. Banks will not be a certain source of low-interest loans. Factories must move aggressively to reform their management, personnel, organization and income distribution systems because in the future `` market competition will be relentless.'' `` There will certainly be some enterprises that will fail in the competition and be declared bankrupt,'' the newspaper said. Under the new law, enterprises will have the right to sell products on their own after meeting obligations to the state, and to choose their own suppliers, set product prices and negotiate and sign contracts with foreign parties. Senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, the mastermind of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s economic reforms, first suggested an enterprise law in 1978, but it was not until this year that disagreements over the relationship among the state, the manager and workers were finally worked out.

 The number of working oil and gas rigs in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> slipped this week by nine to total 894, <ORGANIZATION> Baker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday. During the previous week, the rig count had increased by four to total 903. A year ago this week, the count totaled 973, the company said. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>' rig count, the widely watched industry index of drilling activity, reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs producing oil.

The rig count reached a peak of 4,500 active rigs in December 1981, which was the height of the oil boom. But oil prices plunged to less than $ 10 per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 and the rig count went with it, dropping to 663 _ the lowest since <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> began compiling figures.

 Corn and soybean futures soared their permitted daily limits at the opening today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as hot, dry weather returned to the drought-stricken <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. Wheat and oats also were sharply higher. After a two-week reprieve, the hostile weather has returned with the soybean crop in the midst of its most critical growth stage, analysts said. `` The next two to three weeks are going to make or bake the soybean crop, and it looks like we're going to bake it,'' said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader with the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Dry heat is expected to persist in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> for most of this week and that could mean another round of sharp price increases in the crop futures markets, analysts said. Most contracts for future delivery of corn and soybeans opened up their respective daily limits of 15 cents and 45 cents a bushel. The August soybean contract, on which the limit has been removed pending the contract's expiration later this month, was up more than 70 cents in early trading. Also in early trading, wheat was 12 cents to 17 cents higher with the contract for delivery in September at $ 3.83 a bushel; corn was 15 cents higher across the board with July at $ 3.05 \ a bushel; oats were 10 cents higher across the board with September at $ 2.81 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 45 cents to 71 cents higher with August at $ 8.47 a bushel Most cattle futures were sharply lower while pork futures were sharply higher to limit-up in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 When fashion designer <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON> set his heart on a pair of racy Ferraris, he made one quick telephone call to <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. Many of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s richest car buffs do the same. Displayed on the office walls of <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kruse </PERSON>, the man who answered <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON>'s phone call, are photographs of actors <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Kercheval </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Piscopo </PERSON>, pro football lineman <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosworth </PERSON>, hotelier <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Marriott </PERSON>, and former senator and White House chief of staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. In his late 20s, <PERSON> Kruse </PERSON> is president and owner of <ORGANIZATION> Kruse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, one of the nation's most exotic auction houses. Founded by his father, <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kruse </PERSON>, the company has come to dominate the classic car market at a time when values have skyrocketed. With the dizzying prices in the classic car arena, would-be buyers of modest means are likely destined to remain would-be buyers. `` We deal with such wealth that a guy can get excited and caught up, and it does n't matter that he just spent $ 100 for what most other people think's worth $ 10,'' said <PERSON> Kruse </PERSON>. His figure of $ 100, of course, is figurative. Top models such as Duesenbergs routinely fetch $ 1 million and more. The record belongs to a 1931 <ORGANIZATION> Bugatti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merline </ORGANIZATION>, which brought $ 6.8 million in 1986. Last year, the Kruses coaxed bids of $ 152 million on about 10,000 automobiles. The business started in 1971 at <ORGANIZATION> Auburn </ORGANIZATION>'s annual weekend car festival. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Kruse </PERSON>, a successful local auctioneer of real estate and household goods, noticed many of the old cars carried for-sale signs. So he stepped in and set up an auction. `` We had a rope as a gate, and 3,500 people paid $ 1 to get in, and another 3,500 jumped the rope,'' said the younger <PERSON> Kruse </PERSON>. `` A man turned down $ 35,000 for his <ORGANIZATION> Duesenberg </ORGANIZATION>, which was just unheard of because they were selling for about $ 5,000 to $ 10,000 at the time.'' The auction became an annual Labor Day weekend event and sales jumped. Their calendar takes the Kruses across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, with auctions in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>, as well as major sales in <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. `` We've really developed <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> as a market in the last couple of years because of the incredible wealth down there,'' said <PERSON> Kruse </PERSON>. The Kruses claim to hold 75 percent of the market. Wherever they go, their sales technique does n't vary much from the manner that sells low-price household goods at a farm auction. Sell the sizzle, the Kruses say, not the steak. `` You can have a frying pan, and go ` One dollar, two dollar, three dollar,''' said <PERSON> Kruse </PERSON>. `` Or you can say, ` Oh, I can smell my grandmother's fried chicken in there right now.

<TEXT>
 The dollar finished mixed against other major currencies in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> on Monday. Trading was light and the dollar stayed in a narrow range, dealers said. Gold prices fell, with markets quiet due to a Swiss national holiday. Traders in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said early attempts to push the dollar to new highs met with fears of central bank intervention and profit-taking. `` Everybody's worried about the central banks,'' said a trader for a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bank. `` I still think there will be an attempt to set higher levels,'' on Tuesday, he added. Some traders said the dollar's failure to break new ground suggested that it may have to drop back and establish a bottom before proceeding higher. `` Having just come off the highs and heading down ... it looks a bit more vulnerable on the downside,'' a trader said. Corporate customers, meanwhile, `` just are n't around'' owing to summer holidays, another trader said. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound rose to $ 1.7130, compared with $ 1.7105 on Friday. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where the business day ends as <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s begins, the dollar rose 0.72 yen to a closing 133.25 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at the lower rate of 132.75 yen. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Friday: 1.8758 West German marks, up from 1.8750; 1.5615 Swiss francs, unchanged; 6.3255 French francs, up from 6.3202; 2.1145 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1185; 1,381.50 Italian lire, up from 1,377.75; 1.2075 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2105 Gold fell in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a bid price of $ 433.75 a troy ounce, compared with late Friday's $ 435.25. <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION> was closed for a Swiss national holiday.

The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which surged 46 points on Friday, was unchanged at 2,128.73 at midafternoon. Losers narrowly outpaced gainers in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 675 issues up, 712 down and 501 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 105.03 million shares as of 2 p.m. on Wall Street.

A measured approach to the market could mean better things down the road `` That's the kind of action you get prior to a trend resuming,'' <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Boeing Profits Up 36.8 Percent In Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Higher sales and lower expenses and taxes helped boost <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s second-quarter profits 36.8 percent over the same period of 1987, the Seattle-based aerospace company said today. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> reported net earnings of $ 160 million or $ 1.05 a share on sales of $ 4.71 billion, compared with profits of $ 117 million or 75 cents a share on sales of $ 3.48 billion a year ago. For the first half of 1988, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> had profits of $ 296 million or $ 1.94 a share on sales of $ 8.32 billion, up 26 percent from first-half 1987 profits of $ 235 million or $ 1.51 a share on sales of $ 7.24 billion. In a news release, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> chairman and chief executive officer <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Shrontz </PERSON> attributed the brighter performance to increased sales volume; lower levels of research and development and other new business costs for computing, electronics and military and space programs; and lower federal tax rates. But <PERSON> Shrontz </PERSON> said the gains were offset somewhat by `` significant performance problems'' on several military airplane programs; increased research and development and production costs at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s deHavilland commuter plane division; and having to bear a larger share of expenses on government contracts <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> enjoyed record orders of $ 13.3 billion for commercial planes in the second quarter, with 23 customers ordering 268 jets and 29 turboprop commuter planes. That compares with orders totaling $ 7.6 billion for second-quarter 1987. For the six months ending June 30, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> had orders for 397 jets and 35 turboprop planes valued at $ 18 billion. In the same period of 1987, there were 208 jets and 34 prop planes ordered, worth a total $ 11.1 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> is expected to have its fourth straight year of record orders for commercial jets. The company, however, does not receive payment for planes until they are delivered, which can be years after the orders were entered. Military sales in the first half totaled $ 2.4 billion, $ 200 million less than in the same period of 1987. <PERSON> Shrontz </PERSON> said military sales for 1988 are expected to be slightly less than last year.

<HEAD>Construction Spending Inches up 0.1 Percent</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Stands for digest item slugged AM-Construction Spending.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Construction spending inched up 0.1 percent in June as a big increase in investment for new factories helped offset declines in housing and government projects, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. Building activity rose to a seasonally adjusted, but not inflation-adjusted, annual rate of $ 402.8 billion in June, following a 0.8 percent increase in May. Construction spending for the first half of 1988 was only 1.3 percent above the January-June period of 1987, lagging behind the 2.0 percent rate of inflation in construction costs between the two periods. Analysts had been expecting even greater weakness, predicting office and hotel construction would decline in response to high vacancy rates. But projects are getting built anyway. `` What is happening is ... there is a lot of money available, from here and overseas,'' said economist <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sumichrast </PERSON>, who heads a consulting firm in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Different aspects of the same phenomenon are fueling both the increase in factory investment, which rose 5.7 percent in June and stands 21 percent higher than it was a year ago, and the growing availability of money for other construction projects. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers are spending more on new equipment and building projects to meet higher demand for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods overseas. They're finally benefiting from the fall in the value of the dollar between early 1985 and the end of 1987, which made <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> goods cheaper on foreign markets. However, although the trade deficit is not as bad as it was, foreigners still collect more dollars than they need to buy <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> goods and thus look for ways to invest that money. The Japanese, particularly, prefer to invest surplus dollars in government securities and real estate, rather than in other investments such as corporate stock. `` There's one good -LRB- real estate -RRB- deal for every 50 that you bring to the table, but the money has to be put someplace. ... I'm afraid we're going to continue to build in some areas where we should n't really build,'' <PERSON> Sumichrast </PERSON> said For the rest of the year, analysts are expecting a continued softening of construction activity, led by weakness in housing, which is being hurt by an upward creep in mortgage interest rates. Residential construction fell 0.9 percent in June to an annual rate of $ 188.1 billion, the third decline in a row. A 0.7 percent drop in construction of single-family homes more than offset a 2.3 percent increase in apartment construction. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Savacool </PERSON>, an economist with the <ORGANIZATION> Wefa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON> Bala </PERSON> <PERSON> Cynwyd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, said factory construction will likely strengthen and residential building wane through the rest of this year. However, he said, if the recent appreciation in the dollar, which has rebounded somewhat from its lows at the end of last year, continues, it could choke off the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturing boom and dampen the main area of construction strength. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> offered these details of construction spending in June: _ Non-residential private construction climbed 2.5 percent, the fourth consecutive monthly increase, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 99.2 billion _ Hotel and motel construction increased 19.4 percent after falling for two months Analysts said the category swings widely from month to month because one or two large projects can skew the total. _ Construction of office buildings was off by 0.4 percent from the May level However, the small decline followed increases in May, April and March, and the June rate was still 12 percent higher than a year earlier. _ Shopping center and other commercial construction was unchanged from May _ Government construction projects fell 1.4 percent in June to an annual rate of $ 78.6 billion with highway construction, the biggest segment of the government sector, suffering a 1.6 percent decline

<HEAD>Most Plant Managers Expect Production Gains in Third Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Most <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plant managers expect their production and new orders to increase in the third quarter, continuing the rebound in the nation's manufacturing industry, according to a survey released Monday. The survey by <ORGANIZATION> Dun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Bradstreet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of 1,500 plant managers around the country showed that 46 percent of them expect their production to rise in the current quarter, while only 14 percent anticipate declines. Forty-seven percent of the managers predicted third-quarter increases in new factory orders while 15 percent forecast declines. The plant managers' expectations for the third quarter, however, were slightly less optimistic than their projections for the second quarter. That was because manufacturing growth has been so explosive and can be expected to slow a bit, <ORGANIZATION> Dun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Bradstreet </ORGANIZATION> said. The business information company said plant managers are a good barometer of the nation's manufacturing industry, since they receive information on anticipated demand, orders, prices and production costs. It was the second time that <ORGANIZATION> Dun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Bradstreet </PERSON> did a quarterly survey of plant managers' expectations. `` This is really a continuation of a bullish outlook for the Rust Belt economy,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>, corporate economist and chief statistician for <ORGANIZATION> Dun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Bradstreet </LOCATION>. `` Though the outlook for the third quarter among manufacturers is not as strong as it was for the second quarter, the current level of expectations represents a quantum leap in optimism since the October -LRB- stock market -RRB- crash.'' The 46 percent of the plant managers expecting production to increase in the third quarter was down from 55 percent in the second quarter. Managers predicting gains in new orders declined to 47 percent from 56 percent. `` The manufacturing sector needs time to readjust after bursts of growth like the one it just came through,'' <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> said. `` It is during these momentary lulls that capacity is adjusted, production schedules are revised and the groundwork is laid for future expansion.'' He said it is remarkable that so many plant managers expect continued production increases, given the fact that much of the nation's manufacturing industry already has been producing close to maximum capacity. The dollar's marked decline in recent years has made <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods cheaper and more attractive overseas, stimulating the industrial machine to produce more and straining its capacity. Similarly, for the next 12 months, most of the plant managers polled had slightly less optimistic expectations than in the previous survey. Fifty-nine percent of the managers expect production to increase during the next year, down from 63 percent. Those anticipating a rise in new orders slipped to 58 percent from 63 percent.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Skyrocket As Hot Weather Returns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soybean, corn and oat futures skyrocketed their permitted daily limits Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> amid fears that a new heat wave in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> will do further damage to drought-stressed crops. Wheat futures also closed sharply higher. The return of hot, dry weather to the Corn Belt after a two-week reprieve holds a particular threat to the soybean crop, which is in the middle of its critical pod-filling stage, analysts said. High temperatures _ 95 degrees or higher _ are more detrimental to soybeans at this growth stage than lack of moisture, said <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Feltes </PERSON>, director of commodity research with <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a large, Chicago-based commodities brokerage house. Temperatures soared into the upper 90s Monday afternoon in the central Corn Belt states of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and the hot, dry weather was expected to persist for most of the week. `` If these high temperatures continue, we're looking at a potentially serious shortfall in soybean production, even with the recent rains in the eastern Corn Belt,'' <PERSON> Feltes </PERSON> said. Most contracts for future delivery of oats, corn and soybeans closed up their respective daily limits of 10 cents, 15 cents and 45 cents a bushel. The August soybean contract, on which the limit has been removed pending the contract's expiration later this month, closed more than 60 cents higher. At the close, wheat was 9 cents to 15 cents higher with September at $ 3.81 a bushel; corn was 13 -RCB- cents to 15 cents higher with September at $ 2.90 a bushel; oats were 10 cents higher across the board with September at $ 2.81 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 28 -LCB- cents to 64 cents higher with August at $ 8.40 a bushel.

<HEAD>AGB Suspends U.S. Television Ratings Service</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> AGB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> is suspending its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> television ratings operation, saying it underestimated the costs of competing with audience measurement leader <PERSON> A.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON>. The disclosure disappointed some advertising and television industry executives, who said <ORGANIZATION> AGB </ORGANIZATION> had provided some competition in the national TV ratings arena that has been dominated for 30 years by <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON>. `` They had breathed some life into what had been an inactive portion of the business,'' an executive of a major advertiser said Monday, speaking on condition he not be identified. But others said <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> still faces potential competition from companies such as <ORGANIZATION> Arbitron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ratings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which has announced plans to launch a national TV ratings service over the next few years that also will monitor buying habits. AGB, a limited partnership in which the British concern <ORGANIZATION> AGB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> had a major interest, is widely credited _ or blamed, depending on the view _ with encouraging use of `` people meters'' in measuring national TV audiences. The people meter is a handheld device that not only electronically records when the television is on, but permits viewers to push buttons to record exactly who is watching at any given time. After years of use in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> AGB </ORGANIZATION> decided to employ the devices as it launched its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> television ratings operation in the fall of 1987. <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> had been testing its own people meter, and announced it would rely on the device for its 1987-88 ratings as well. Under its old system, <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> used a combination of meters to measure when sets were on and handwritten diaries to tell who watched particular shows. Critics of the old system said an explosion in viewing choices made it increasingly unrealistic for anyone to record accurately in a diary what everyone in the family watched. But others said the people meters have shortcomings as well, such as in measuring viewing by children. `` If it had n't been for AGB coming into the market with their people meter, I do n't think <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> would have come out as soon with their people meter,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Otter </PERSON>, a senior vice president at the advertising agency <ORGANIZATION> McCann-Erickson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worldwide </ORGANIZATION>. But the cost of the ratings service was more than AGB had expected. The London-based <ORGANIZATION> AGB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> said it had estimated in April 1987 that it would cost $ 49 million for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> service, but that within a year the complexities of the market had driven costs past $ 67 million. `` Following discussions with the TV networks, advertising agencies and advertisers, it became clear that despite considerable support, the prospects for future revenue would not make the project viable and would be unlikely to cover the increased level of costs,'' the company said. This past spring, <ORGANIZATION> AGB </ORGANIZATION> approached the three major television networks in an effort to get all three to sign up for this fall and beyond. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> had been the only major network to subscribe to the AGB ratings in the 1987-88 season, and getting <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> to join was seen not only as a way to boost revenue for <ORGANIZATION> AGB </ORGANIZATION> but also as a signal to advertisers and their agencies of the prospects for the service. `` It is disappointing to have one of the competitors gone,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sonkin </PERSON>, vice president for network audience research at Capital Cities-ABC. But he said <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> decided against subscribing because of the cost. Asked for a response to <ORGANIZATION> AGB </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement, <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON>'s chairman and chief executive, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Holt </PERSON>, said, `` Our operating assumption that the television audience measurement business is a competitive one remains unchanged.'' At <ORGANIZATION> Arbitron </ORGANIZATION>, spokeswoman <PERSON> Nan </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said the AGB decision will have no effect on that company's plans, which call for introduction of a system that monitors both viewing and buying habits in five major markets in the fall of 1989 and expansion into a national system in the fall of 1990. She noted <ORGANIZATION> Arbitron </ORGANIZATION> has been measuring local audiences in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for years and has a long-term commitment to a national service. In announcing <PERSON> Arbtron </PERSON>'s plans in June, Arbitron Presdident A.J. <PERSON> Aurichio </PERSON> said he expected <ORGANIZATION> Arbitron </ORGANIZATION> would lose $ 125 million on the syswtem over four to five years before breaking even in 1995. In announcing the suspension of its television ratings service, <ORGANIZATION> AGB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> also announced it would acquire <ORGANIZATION> Mediamark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which measures magazine audiences, in an exchange of stock. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON>, chairman of Mediamark, said <ORGANIZATION> AGB </ORGANIZATION>'s choice of the word `` suspension'' in describing the status of its <ORGANIZATION> AGB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> operation in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was deliberate, leaving open the possibility that it could be resurrected in another form at some future date.

 The stock market managed to hold onto recent gains today despite sporadic bouts of profit-taking. Stock prices seesawed slightly after a mixed opening but the market ultimately remained firm. Analysts were encouraged by traders' restrained approach to equities following last week's 68-point jump in the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials. `` The market is holding rather tenaciously to that gain,'' noted <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Metz </PERSON>, vice president and technical analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Oppenheimer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` It is absorbing profit-taking with relative ease.'' <PERSON> Metz </PERSON> said strength in the bond market supported equities, with some investors concluding that `` we may have seen the worst in the rise of long-term -LRB- interest -RRB- rates.'' Analysts said they would have been far more concerned had the market opened on a strong note and built too quickly on last week's gains `` What you do n't want to see is instant euphoria,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON>, first vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. A measured approach to the market could mean better things down the road `` That's the kind of action you get prior to a trend resuming,'' <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON> said. Market watchers have been reluctant to proclaim the summer rally back on track despite the market's recent gains.

<HEAD>South Africa Bill Would Cost Americans $1.2 Billion, Survey Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investors could lose $ 1.2 billion on their shares in South African gold mining stocks if legislation requiring Americans to sell all their investments in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> becomes law, a report said Monday. The legislation introduced by Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Dellums </PERSON>, D-Calif., is intended to bring pressure on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to end its system of apartheid, in which the black majority has no voice in national affairs Americans would lose money because the legislation would force them to sell at depressed, `` fire sale'' prices, the study said. The report was based on economists' models of the interaction of supply and demand. The study was conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> Wefa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a consulting firm based in <PERSON> Bala </PERSON> <PERSON> Cynwyd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a New York-based mutual fund that invests in precious metals mining stocks and has about 40 percent of its assets in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Americans owned $ 4.5 billion in South African mining shares as of the end of 1987, and of that, $ 3.2 billion was in gold mining shares, making it the single most popular South African investment for Americans, the study said. International Investors estimated that about 500,000 Americans own shares in gold mining stocks. The study did not attempt to calculate overall losses to American investors if the bill became law. A Dellums spokesman, <PERSON> R.H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, said the congressman believes negative effects of the bill would be temporary because the end of apartheid would free the South African economy from its `` state of siege.'' The legislation is sponsored in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> by Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> ended a six-month power struggle Monday with settlement of lawsuits over their proxy fight earlier this year. As part of the settlement, <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> will buy back an estimated 16 million shares at $ 45 each, or a total of $ 720 million. The deal also contains a `` stand-still'' agreement, under which <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> said it would not buy significant numbers of <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> shares, participate in any proxy contest or otherwise seek control of the company for three years. The settlement ends <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION>'s suit stemming from the April 21 proxy vote it lost to <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>. As a result, the personal care products giant does not face a rerun of the election. A federal judge said last month he was inclined to order a new vote because <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> misled stockholders in an advertisement about <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> before the election. Industry analysts have said a rematch would have strengthened <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION>'s hand. Under terms of the settlement, all <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> stockholders may sell one share back to the company at $ 45 for each seven they own. <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> officials estimated the total number of shares likely to be purchased under the settlement agreement are about 16 million of the approximately 112 million outstanding shares. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Froelich </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Pershing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said that the settlement means that <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> management `` wants to keep the status quo. But they're shrinking the capital and diluting earnings a bit.'' After <ORGANIZATION> Revlon </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Perelman </PERSON>'s failed bid for <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> in 1986, <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> paid $ 558 million to buy back 9.2 million shares of stock. But <PERSON> Froelich </PERSON> said the company will be able to continue to fight off such takeover attempts `` as long as they keep the earnings rising and they have. I do n't think the stockholders will be too badly off.'' <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> stock plunged $ 2.62 -LCB- a share to $ 37.50 in composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION>, which owns nearly 6 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> stock, forced the proxy vote earlier this year in hopes of winning four directors' seats to pressure the 12-member <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> board to sell the company. <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> believes a sale would boost the value of <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> stock. <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> filed suit April 14 seeking to block <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION>'s proxy bid on the grounds that <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> falsified <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> filings and di not fully disclose all investors. A countersuit filed by <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> five days later alleged <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> misrepresented <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> in advertisements and mailings to the company's 27,000 shareholders and failed to publicly disclose all companies that had expressed interest in buying <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court Judge <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> ruled in early April that <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> inaccurately portrayed <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> in newspaper advertisements leading up to the proxy vote in which shareholders rejected a <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> slate of four dierctor candidates. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Tierney </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> general partner, issued a statement saying: `` We believe this settlement at this time is in the best interests of all concerned.'' <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>, maintained that `` all shareholders will benefit'' from the repurchase agreement and said it was not dissimilar to a buy-back plan announced by the company for shareholders in 1986, prior to the <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> action.

 The stock market finished mixed Monday but largely resisted traders' sporadic efforts to cash in on last week's sharp gains. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which surged 68 points last week, inched up 1.78 to close at 2,130.51. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 11-to-9 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 830 issues up, 672 down and 481 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> came to 138.17 million shares, down from 192.34 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled 157.84 million shares. Stock prices opened mixed and seesawed in a narrow range. While traders wondered whether last week's gains could be sustained, analysts were divided over just how healthy the day's trading shaped up to be. Some were encouraged that the market held its ground. `` The market is holding rather tenaciously to -LRB- last week's -RRB- gain,'' noted <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Metz </PERSON>, vice president and technical analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Oppenheimer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` It is absorbing profit-taking with relative ease.'' A stronger bond market and a rise in the Dow's key transportation sector helped support equities. But other observers, pointing to anemic volume and a lack of a conviction, were not so satisfied. `` All last week's rally did was recover losses from the prior week,'' said <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Peroni </PERSON>, a technical analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Janney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. He noted that stocks moved to `` the upper end of their trading range and then ran out of momentum.'' Those who appeared pleased with the day's events said they would have been far more concerned had the market's upward move resumed at a brisk pace. `` What you do n't want to see is instant euphoria,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON>, first vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. A measured approach to the market could mean better things down the road `` That's the kind of action you get prior to a trend resuming,'' <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON> said. Among actively traded <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> issues, <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> was down 2 | at 37 -LCB-; the razor-blade maker reached a stand-still agreement in its legal dispute with <ORGANIZATION> Coniston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> and said it will buy back 16 million shares for $ 45 each <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, which reported higher quarterly earnings, was up 1 ~ at 62 -RRB- Armtek jumped 4 \ to 42 Mark IV Industries, which holds 14.9 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Armtek </ORGANIZATION>, intends to offer $ 40-a-share for the company. Central & amp; <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, the most active issue with 19.7 million shares changing hands, was up -LRB- at 31 -LCB-. Traders were interested in capturing the company's dividend. Elsewhere, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> was up -LCB- at 126 \, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> was up 1 at 29 -LRB-, and <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> was off | at 44 -RCB- As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market gained $ 3.25 billion, or 0.12 percent, in value. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> index rose 0.17 to 153.52. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's index of 400 industrials fell 0.03 to 313.95, while <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index rose 0.19 to 271.21.

 <ORGANIZATION> NV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philips </ORGANIZATION>, the Dutch electronics giant, Monday named a new chief executive at <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and split off $ 1 billion worth of peripheral operations into an independent subsidiary. <ORGANIZATION> Philips </ORGANIZATION> said the changes, which will take effect Sept. 1, were intended to `` further integrate the <ORGANIZATION> Philips </ORGANIZATION> organization in the <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION> into the global activities of the company.'' <ORGANIZATION> Philips </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s largest electronics company and the world's No 1 television manufacturer, last week reported a 44 percent decline in its second-quarter profit.

The new subsidiary will include the Magnavox defense contracting business, which had to be kept independent of the Dutch-based company because of <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> rules. It will also include a variety of peripheral businesses ranging from Anchor Brush toothbrushes and Genie garage door openers to <ORGANIZATION> Selmer </ORGANIZATION> musical instruments and Magnavox cable television equipment. The creation of <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> should not be considered a prelude to the disposal of some of the businesses in it, said <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruttner </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philips </ORGANIZATION>. The operations to be included in the new subsidiary accounted for about $ 1 billion of <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philips </ORGANIZATION>' 1987 revenue of $ 5.5 billion and about 15,500 of its 59,000 employees. <ORGANIZATION> Philips </ORGANIZATION>' brand names include <ORGANIZATION> Philips </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Norelco </ORGANIZATION>, Magnavox, Philco and Sylvania.

<HEAD>Pryor Bill Would Require Registration of Consultants</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: also on general news wires.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Private consultants to defense contractors would have to register with the federal government under provisions of a bill introduced in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Monday by Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ark </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> chairs the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Government Affairs federal service subcommittee, which has held a series of hearings on the use of consultants by <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> contractors. `` The bill is intended to shed some sunshine on the all-too-shadowy world of consultants. Bringing everything into the light should cut down on the shady dealings,'' said <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>. He was referring to the current investigation that focuses on allegations that contractors' consultants, many of them former <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> employees, paid bribes to current <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> workers for inside information about contracts. No charges have yet been filed. Federal officials testified to <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>'s subcommittee that they did n't know specifically how much was being spent on consultants. In part, that lack of knowledge comes from the fact that contracts do n't have to detail services provided by consultants. <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>'s bill would create a registry of consultants and no consultants could be hired unless they were registered. That registration would require detailed information about the identity of a consultant's clients along with the services provided by the consultant. The bill would also detail a new category in federal budgets, requiring government departments to list the amount they spend on consultants.

<HEAD>Antifreeze Prices Seen Rising On Tighter Supplies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OMAHA, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Low supplies have doubled the price of antifreeze to about $ 7 a gallon and may drive it even higher, suppliers and distributors say. Supplies have been limited by a shortage of ethylene glycol, the base for antifreeze, and by a series of explosions and fires at antifreeze production plants, distributors told the <ORGANIZATION> Omaha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World-Herald </ORGANIZATION>. `` There's going to be a situation this fall where shelves are quite empty,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Mielenz </PERSON>, manager of specialty products for <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. Antifreeze is used in the cooling systems of cars and other vehicles to protect their engines from freezing in the winter and overheating in the summer. <PERSON> Riaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Waraich </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Old </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, one of the country's major antifreeze suppliers, said the antifreeze shortage is a long-term problem caused by the shortage of ethylene glycol, a compound derived from natural gas that is the base for plastics and polyesters as well as antifreeze. Antifreeze, the smallest and least profitable part of the ethylene glycol market, is losing the competition to plastics, which are in high demand, <PERSON> Waraich </PERSON> said from <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plaines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. Just when demand for the compound was increasing, a series of refinery explosions took a big bite out of the ethylene glycol supply Explosions last year in plants in <LOCATION> Antwerp </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> reduced supplies worldwide. In May, an explosion shut down a <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> refinery in <LOCATION> Norco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>. In June, fire swept a <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> plant. The disasters cut 35 million to 40 million gallons of antifreeze from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market, which uses 200 million gallons annually, <PERSON> Waraich </PERSON> said. `` The real impact will be felt in October-November when <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Public </PERSON> goes to the store for his coolant,'' said <PERSON> Waraich </PERSON>, whose company produces Peak, <ORGANIZATION> Advance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Full </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> brands of antifreeze. Some in the industry said some consumers and suppliers are hoarding antifreeze, making the crunch worse. Others said suppliers actually have restricted their orders to prevent hoarding. <PERSON> Lonn </PERSON> <PERSON> Harlan </PERSON>, district manager of <ORGANIZATION> Rennoco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, a wholesale antifreeze distributor, said that due to higher prices from suppliers his company has boosted wholesale prices of antifreeze from $ 3.23 to $ 7.18 per gallon in the last four months. <PERSON> Rennoco </PERSON> could have to boost prices to more than $ 11 a gallon wholesale by Jan. 1, <PERSON> Harlan </PERSON> said. Target Stores' antifreeze prices have climbed from $ 3.99 a gallon in June to $ 8 a gallon for Prestone and $ 6 for Xerex, said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Hite </PERSON>, vice president for public and consumer affairs. K mart stores will take a loss on antifreeze sales because of the shortage, said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, sports-auto manager at the chain's <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> store Increased production is not possible in the short run, industry spokesmen said. The Shell plant in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and the Texaco plant are not back at full production and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can not restore its lost supply of ethylene glycol because it can not import the raw material, <PERSON> Waraich </PERSON> said. Importing ethylene gas requires special shipping terminals the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not have, he said.

 Soybean, corn and oat futures prices shot up their permitted daily limits Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> amid fears that the latest heat wave in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> will do further damage to drought-stressed crops. Wheat futures also closed sharply higher. On other exchanges, coffee futures plummeted; cattle futures were sharply higher while pork futures were sharply lower; precious metals were mixed; energy futures were mixed; and stock-index futures retreated. The return of hot, dry weather to the Corn Belt after a two-week reprieve holds a particular threat to the soybean crop, which is in the middle of its critical pod-filling stage, analysts said. Hot temperatures _ 95 degrees or higher _ are even more detrimental to soybeans than lack of moisture at this growth stage, said <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Feltes </PERSON>, director of commodity research with <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a large, Chicago-based commodities brokerage house. Temperatures approached or exceeded 100 degrees Monday afternoon in the central Corn Belt states of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and the hot, dry weather was expected to persist for most of the week. `` If these high temperatures continue, we're looking at a potentially serious shortfall in soybean production, even with the recent rains in the eastern Corn Belt,'' <PERSON> Feltes </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Lespinasse </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the critical period for soybean development would run through the third week in August. `` The next two to three weeks are going to make or bake the soybean crop, and it looks like we're going to bake it,'' he said. Most contracts for future delivery of oats, corn and soybeans closed up their respective daily limits of 10 cents, 15 cents and 45 cents a bushel. The August soybean contract, on which the limit has been removed pending the contract's expiration later this month, gained 63 cents. Wheat settled 8 -LCB- cents to 14 cents higher with September at $ 3.81 a bushel; corn was 13 -RCB- cents to 15 cents higher with September at $ 2.90 a bushel; oats were 10 cents higher across the board with September at $ 2.81 -LCB- a bushel; and soybeans were 27 cents to 63 cents higher with August at $ 8.39 a bushel. Hot weather also contributed to limit losses in coffee futures on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Coffee consumption typically hits its lowest point in mid-summer, and expectations that cash prices will fall prompted heavy speculative selling of coffee futures, said <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaul </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Three coffee contracts settled down the 6-cent daily limit The limitless September contract plunged 8.05 cents to settle at $ 1.1667 a pound. Cattle futures dipped on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in response to Friday's semi-annual cattle inventory report from the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which showed the nation's cattle herd to be larger than the markets had anticipated. Analysts said the sharp rise in grain prices also weighed on prices for near-term delivery of cattle; feeder cattle for September and October delivery plunged the 1.50-cents-a-pound daily limit. Limit advances in the pork pits were fueled by fears that hot, humid weather would decrease the number of hogs brought to market this week and by rising cash prices for pork bellies, said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Thomson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McKinnon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .35 cent to .95 cent lower with August at 66.17 cents a pound; feeder cattle were 1.50 cents lower to .10 cent higher with August at 78.37 cents a pound; hogs were .55 cent to 1.50 cents higher with August at 45.30 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were unchanged to 2 cents higher with August at 32.52 cents a pound Silver futures gained while gold retreated on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Silver, which had fallen sharply last week, bounced back on bargain hunting and confirmation that <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s state-owned mining company, <ORGANIZATION> Centromin </ORGANIZATION>, had stated it might not meet its contractual obligations to deliver silver due to a 2-week-old miners' strike, analysts said. Gold settled $ 1.70 lower across the board with August at $ 434.40 a troy ounce; silver was 6 cents to 6.9 cents higher with September at $ 6.915 a troy ounce. Crude oil futures prices fell slightly and oil products finished mixed in quiet trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as traders looked ahead to Wednesday's scheduled meeting of <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s price monitoring committee West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 23 cents to 25 cents lower with September at $ 16.08 a barrel; heating oil was .03 cent lower to .15 cent higher with September at 45.12 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .70 cent lower to .46 cent higher with September at 48.59 cents a gallon. Stock index futures retreated slightly on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for September delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled .60 point lower at 272.65.

 They prefer not to call it an invasion, but it was a meticulously planned operation that brought about 250 <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> officials to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to take over the state's largest bank holding company. With military-like precision and secrecy to match, the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> bankers set up camp at a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> hotel and waited for the announcement that finally brought the failing <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> into their fold last Friday. `` We were all real pleased,'' said <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Iversen </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NCBC </ORGANIZATION>'s senior vice president for marketing on Monday. `` There have n't been any hitches at all.'' The <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> employees were flown into <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> late Thursday and early Friday morning, expecting a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> press conference that would mark the end of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> banking presence and the birth of <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. Rumors had circulated earlier in the week that <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> had a lock on a takeover and that the press conference would be a mere formality, one local bank analyst said. But <PERSON> Iversen </PERSON> said Monday that he and his <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> advance team had heard no such rumors. When the press conference site shifted to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, near-panic set in. `` It was n't a done deal as far as we were concerned,'' <PERSON> Iversen </PERSON> said. `` We were on pins and needles.'' <PERSON> Iversen </PERSON> and others breathed a collective sigh of relief when news came that the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> bank holding company had indeed won the bidding, conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` We had done ads for newspapers and radio, tons of posters and customer letters,'' he said. `` If the deal had n't been done, we would n't have been able to use that for anything but scrap paper.'' All of the posters, letters and advertising was secretly produced in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and then quietly shipped to <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> on Thursday via <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>. There was so much material that <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> had to rent a separate hotel room just to store it, <PERSON> Iversen </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> delegation will stay on for short time longer, officials said. Advance team members will be stationed at each of the First RepublicBank offices throughout <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` They'll be there to reassure customers,'' <PERSON> Iversen </PERSON> explained. `` Then after one week, we'll go away.'' First RepublicBank's 40 <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> banks were turned over to <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> on Friday. The following day, <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> IFRB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, its wholly owned subsidiary and intermediate holding company formed in last year's merger with <ORGANIZATION> InterFirst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Code. In light of the bankruptcy filings, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on Monday suspended trading in First RepublicBank's stock. First RepublicBank retains a single bank in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> and certain subsidiaries engaged in non-banking activities, the bank said in a statement.

 When <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> came to the rescue of ailing <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, it was doing what came naturally _ aggressively expanding into new markets. `` The single biggest strength of this company is we have a ` do business' attitude,'' <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> vice president <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Middlemas </PERSON> said Monday. `` We try to do something with every deal that comes in. Maybe we do n't do it as it's presented, but we try to do it. `` It's part of our culture _ our strength,'' he added. `` We're quite prepared to go there -LRB- <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> -RRB- and do business. As he spoke, some 250 <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> managers were in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> taking control of the 41 banks that made up the insolvent <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, now operating as <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. On Friday, <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> _ currently the nation's 18th largest bank with $ 28.6 billion in assets _ was selected to acquire the financially ailing <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> bank in what has been described as the largest bank rescue in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said it would spend up to $ 4 billion to bail out <LOCATION> First </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> but expects to recoup a large portion of those losses. <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> was created in 1960 when <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Charlotte </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greensboro </ORGANIZATION> merged. The new bank had $ 480 million in assets, 1,300 employees and 40 offices in 20 <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> cities and towns. In the next two decades, <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> grew rapidly through mergers with existing banks and by opening new offices. It also gained a national reputation for aggressively pursuing new markets. In 1981, <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> purchased <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. Federal law had barred a bank from operating in more than one state, but the merger was approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> because <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> had owned a trust company in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> since 1972, before the state enacted laws prohibiting the takeover by out-of-state companies Observers say <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION>'s venture into <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> sparked a five-year buying spree that tripled it's assets to nearly $ 29 billion.

 <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> issued a compromise offer Monday in an effort to avert a strike by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> that could affect 41,000 commuters and disrupt freight deliveries in several Farm Belt states. Separately, Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill., said he planned to introduce legislation to speedily extend a cooling-off period in the labor dispute for 36 days, which would postpone any strike action The railroad offered to accept a recommendation by a presidential emergency panel to eliminate 700 brakemen's jobs, instead of the 1,150 cuts <ORGANIZATION> C </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; NW had previously said were needed. But <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> general counsel <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said the union was not impressed by the offer. `` That wo n't settle it,'' <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said. C & amp; NW spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Foote </PERSON> said the railroad `` made a concessionary offer to the union to try and settle this dispute.'' But he acknowledged the railroad is `` not very hopeful'' the union will accept the offer to avert the strike, scheduled to begin Thursday. The recommendation initially came from the <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> in July, which President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> appointed in April in an effort to solve the longstanding dispute, <PERSON> Foote </PERSON> said. Until Monday's compromise offer, <ORGANIZATION> C </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> NW </ORGANIZATION> had said it wanted to save $ 51 million a year by cutting most of its train crews from four to two people, eliminating what it considers unnecessary brakemen's jobs and leaving an engineer and conductor on board The union has considered that move unacceptable. The presidential panel recommended that all the railroad's freight trains be operated with three brakemen instead of four, that only two brakemen be used on certain nonstop freight trains, <PERSON> Foote </PERSON> said The strike would affect commuters in a six-county area around <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> for whom C & amp; NW provides service through an agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Metra </ORGANIZATION>, a suburban commuter rail service. It would also affect freight service in several Midwestern states. However, neither side can act until a cooling-off period ordered by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ends at 12:01 a.m. on Aug. 4. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said Monday's move by the <ORGANIZATION> C </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; NW was intended to persuade <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> not to extend the cooling-off period. `` C & amp; NW does n't want'' the strike to be postponed, he said. `` They want it to come to a head. `` All the purpose of this statement is to persuade <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> not to take any action,'' <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said. But in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Carle </PERSON> said an extension of the cooling-off period would give both sides `` breathing room'' to come up with a solution on their own. He said <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> would introduce the bill under a `` fast-track'' procedure that would allow a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote Tuesday, and would work with several <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members who could get it through that chamber the next day.

<TEXT>
 Shipments from the steel service center industry, which includes carbon industrial steel products and stainless steel, should increase by 3 percent this year, a trade association forecast said Monday. Such an increase would bring total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shipments for the $ 24 billion steel service center industry to a record 23.7 million tons, the <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said. ` We had a record first quarter and a solid second quarter, pushing first-half shipments 5 percent ahead of last year's record pace,'' said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharkey </PERSON>, president of the institute, which represents the interests of 85 percent of the steel service center industry. According to <PERSON> Sharkey </PERSON>, `` We anticipate that the third and fourth quarters will be strong, although unable to match 1987's exceptionally strong second half As such, the overall gain for the year will be about 3 percent, versus the 5 percent gain through the first six months.''

The terms were not disclosed. The merger is the culmination of talks that began two months ago and were prompted partly by <ORGANIZATION> Butcher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Singer's interest in Wheat's computer operations, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> McElroy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive of Wheat, <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> McBee </PERSON> <PERSON> Butcher </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> Butcher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Singer, which has roots going back to the American Revolution, said both parties would like to have the merger completed by the end of September. `` I think that everyone is enthusiastic about it because it makes you much more of a contender when you're this size,'' <PERSON> Butcher </PERSON> said. Butcher also said the privately-held firm was being sold to cut costs and to boost efficiencies. The merger will eliminate about 100 of the firm's 500 jobs in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, he said. Butcher and other executives from the firm will become officers of <ORGANIZATION> WFS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION>, the Richmond-based parent of Wheat, <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. However, top levels of management will be filled by Wheat executives. Although the headquarters will remain in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, both Butcher and Wheat will maintain separate brokerage offices and none will close. Butcher said Wheat interests would own a majority of the combined companies. He also said <PERSON> Johannes </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuerst </PERSON> von Thurn und Taxis, a West German prince who bought one-third interest in Butcher last December, will be a minority owner in WFS. Under the terms of the arrangement, the companies will form <ORGANIZATION> WBF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a financial services and investment banking holding company with two separate divisions. The company will have capital of $ 56 million, about $ 15 million contributed by Butcher & amp; Singer. WBF will be owned by the existing <ORGANIZATION> WSF </ORGANIZATION> Financial. The company will have about 2,000 employees, including 750 investment brokers in 92 locations from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>.
