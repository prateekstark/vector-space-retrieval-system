 Opposition leaders demanded Thursday that government troops stop arresting pro-democracy <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks and students after military ruler <PERSON> Gen </PERSON>. Saw <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> pledged to hold elections as soon as peace is restored. The capital was quiet for the third day since troops ruthlessly suppressed protests against the military coup that <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> led Sunday. <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>, who became prime minister Wednesday, is the third new leader in two months of chaos and bloodshed. Like the two government heads before him, he is closely associated with Ne Win, who seized power in 1962. Ne Win resigned in late July after widespread protests against 26 years of authoritarian rule that plunged resource-rich <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> into poverty. His successor, <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, lasted for 17 days of massive street protests. The next ruler, President <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>, was a civilian but was seen as close to the military. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> said Thursday it was cutting off all aid to <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> except humanitarian assistance. <PERSON> Rudi </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said he believed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> totaled $ 12.3 million, but he did not know how much of the aid is humanitarian. A letter sent to <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> on Thursday from opposition leaders <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON>, Tin Oo, and <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> urged the government `` not to arrest people including the monks, students, artists, etc., in connection with the recent unrest and also to release those already under detention.'' Since the coup, security forces have broken up protest centers manned mostly by monks and students in at least 95 towns. They have reported only eight arrests in those sweeps. The government also said security forces arrested 100 people in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>; they were described as looters. The opposition figures also urged <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>, who was armed forces commander before the coup, to end his ban on newspapers and announce a list of casualties in shooting. The government has acknowledged security forces killed at least 146 people since the coup, but a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> diplomat put the figure as high as 400, including many unarmed pro-democracy demonstrators. Opposition leaders did not reply to <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>'s letter received Wednesday in which he said the army does not intend to hold onto power for long and asked for help to prepare for what would be the first multiparty elections since 1960. `` The army has no intention to retain the duties of state power for a long time, in addition to its existing onerous duties. We had to step in unavoidably because of the deteriorating general conditions in the country,'' said the letter, <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>'s first contact with the opposition leadership. `` We promise you that free and fair general elections will be held as soon as peace and tranquillity is restored in the country.'' The letter added that political parties will be allowed to use government radio and television for their campaigns. But <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> did not set a date for the promised elections. <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>, a civilian who was briefly president before being ousted in Sunday's coup, bowed to massive street protests and agreed to end one-party rule and hold multiparty elections as soon as early October. But the opposition rejected that formula and instead continued street demonstrations demanding an interim government be formed to conduct the balloting. In <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, more roadside shops were open Thursday than the previous day, but large markets remained closed. The doors of government offices were open, but no one was working. Most public employees have been on pro-democracy strikes since Aug. 8 and the government has set an Oct. 3 deadline for them to return to work. Sketchy reports received from <LOCATION> Mandalay </LOCATION>, the second-largest city, and other towns indicated security forces and protesters fought this week, though not as fierce as in the capital. State radio said security forces arrested eight people Wednesday night in a sweep of the protest center at <ORGANIZATION> Mandalay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and killed two other people in separate incidents in the city. <LOCATION> Mandalay </LOCATION> is about 350 miles north of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. Also Wednesday night, a group of people sent about 50 water buffaloes after soldiers on the Mandalay Golf Course and attacked the troops with catapults and metal darts. The radio said the attackers escaped but five buffaloes were reported killed. A diplomat said a few <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> would be evacuated to <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> in the next few days. More than 100 dependents of staff members were evacuated earlier. `` The embassy remains open. This is as a precaution,'' said <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Petzing </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> expressed concern Thursday about political developments in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> and said it would wait to decide whether to recognize the new military government. <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> is the largest foreign aid donor to <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> although official assistance has dropped recently. <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, once the world's largest rice exporter, last year joined 40 other countries officially designated by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> as `` least developed nation.'' Officials said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the European Economic community protested the recent bloodshed. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> earlier said it might withdraw aid in light of the military coup and bloodshed.

 A new generation of skyscrapers is about to alter the skyline of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, previously dismissed as sterile and nondescript. Even homegrown architect <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Portman </PERSON>, whose glass towers and soaring atriums for years defined <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and who in the past criticized post-modern architecture as a step backward, has given a nod to the style in his latest project, a 60-story office building planned for downtown <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. Much of the excitement over the pending transformation of the capital of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> started last fall with the opening of the 50-story <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> building. Officially called One <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, it is a slender, post-modern tower of stone with tall arched entryways and Gothic finials, dramatically crowned by a 100-foot-high, eight-sided copper pyramid topped by a golden lantern. Rush-hour traffic on Interstate 85 slows to a cautious crawl as drivers gaze its way. At night, the lights in its crown command attention from all over town. Architecture writers have used words like `` gracious,'' `` truly wonderful,'' `` serene,'' `` imposing'' and `` glamorous'' to describe the tower. `` It certainly projects a vibrance to the rest of the world,'' said <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, vice president for economic development with the <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's just beautiful. Everybody's just staggered by it. The tower is a dramatic departure from the glass boxes common in modern architecture and contrasts with the sleek look of most of the city's tallest buildings. Its influence shows up in at least three other skyscrapers going up in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, and the design of the proposed Promenade skyscraper complex was altered to complement the rose-colored <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> tower. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> architect <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Burgee </PERSON>, whose firm designed the <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> building with design consultant <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, wo n't take credit for transforming <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s skyline. But he said the city's image, as defined by the way it looks, is undergoing a change. `` <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> has been looking for its identity,'' <PERSON> Burgee </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office. `` It's an historical city -LRB- but -RRB- its architecture and image is not strictly historical. You think of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and you think of ` Gone With The Wind.' Now, there is an attempt to come up with a visual image. `` We all know <LOCATION> Peachtree </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, but you do n't think of its buildings,'' he said. `` Like in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the Empire State Building; <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> building; <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> TransAmerica </ORGANIZATION> building. <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> does n't have that. It's moving toward that, very definitely.'' <PERSON> Burgee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> also are behind One Ninety One Peachtree Tower, a post-modern skyscraper planned for downtown <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. Another planned project grouped in the `` Son of <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'' building spurt is the Promenade in the tree-lined, historic Midtown section, a complex of three office buildings and a hotel being developed by <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T and the Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> Landmarks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. When unveiled last year, it was designed with an exterior of glittering green glass. But when Promenade officials saw the excitement over the nearby <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION>, its architects, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Ventulett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Stainback </PERSON>, redrew the plans to use rose glass above rose-toned stone and topped with a gray steel spire. The most recently announced skyscraper is a downtown giant by <PERSON> Portman </PERSON>, whose imprint is already deeply felt in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, primarily through the <ORGANIZATION> Peachtree </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and the towering cylindrical Westin Peachtree Plaza Hotel. <PERSON> Portman </PERSON>'s new building is slated to begin construction next year and, at 60 stories, will eclipse One <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> as the Southeast's tallest building Unveiling the design in May, <PERSON> Portman </PERSON> said it was `` respectful of the past but, like this city, is audacious and bold and forward-looking _ the beginning of post-post-modern architecture.'' <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Durfee </PERSON>, a professor of architecture at <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION>, said completion of the <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> tower signaled the acceleration of a change in the look of the city that began a decade ago. `` <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> was pretty much plain vanilla,'' he said, `` with no development of architectural significance.'' <PERSON> Burgee </PERSON> echoed that appraisal, saying, `` It was pretty nondescript. It might be anyplace. If they took you -LRB- to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> -RRB- blindfolded and took off the blindfold, you would n't have a clue where you are.'' <PERSON> Durfee </PERSON> said that 10 years ago, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> was groping to form an identity and had no demand for the type of buildings now are going up. Today, however, companies want sophistication in their office buildings, <PERSON> Durfee </PERSON> said, and corporate sponsorship of building projects has changed the rules of skyscraper financing. Some say that all the building activity simply makes good business sense. `` Sure, there's competitive prestige. Good architecture is good business,'' said <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartshorn </PERSON>, chairman of the geography department at <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and a specialist in urban affairs. A good-looking building, he said, `` is easier to sell to the financing people as well as the tenants.'' <PERSON> Hartshorn </PERSON> said he expects the new projects in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> will bring special recognition. `` I think it's going to open some eyes,'' he said. `` We have prestige with our cultural buildings, but I do n't know that our office buildings are that distinctive nationally. `` These are n't just ultra post-modern. They're classic. They're different.

 State employees wo n't be dialing for dollars any longer after their attempts to cash in on a $ 1,000 radio call-in contest brought the Capitol's telephone system to a crashing halt. `` I guess the economy is so bad in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> that everybody is trying to get money,'' <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Stringfellow </PERSON>, state director of telecommunications, said Tuesday. `` But you should n't be using state phones to be calling on to radio contests.'' Officials reset the phone system to prevent any calls to the exchange set aside for radio call-in contests after service was disrupted several times, <PERSON> Stringfellow </PERSON> said. `` We thought we had just had an equipment failure,'' he said. `` But the second time it went down one of our employees suggested it was at the same time as one of the radio contests.'' Officials discovered the phone failure occurred within a minute of the start of a contest by a local radio station offering a $ 1,000 prize. The Capitol phone system has about 14,000 lines, and its usual capacity is about 2,000 calls at any time. But the radio contest bumped the phone traffic up to 8,000 calls, <PERSON> Stringfellow </PERSON> said.

 Forget about toga parties. <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students have come up with something more relevant for the 1980s and this presidential year _ the Pledge party. As in Pledge of Allegiance, of course. Police were responding for the second time to noise complaints about a party at a student's house when <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> junior <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBoeuf </PERSON> led 150 to 200 revelers in the Pledge. `` I thought it'd be funny,'' said <PERSON> LeBoeuf </PERSON>, who led the group from a trough containing beer kegs and ice. `` What are the police going to do with 200 people standing around saying the pledge _ arrest them for being patriotic?'' No, but they did cite host Kimberly A. Mart for violating the city's noise ordinance after the patriotic partyers pushed police noise meters over the town's 70-decibel limit. The citation, the second given for the Sept. 10 party, could cost Mart $ 128. She was scheduled to appear in court on Tuesday for the misdemeanor violation. `` The officers were kind of laughing when they took the meter reading,'' said <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, 21, who lives at the house. `` People were n't saying it in any hostile way. They had smiles on their faces and some had hands over their hearts. No big deal, we thought.''

<HEAD>Leading Mafia Investigator Agrees to Stay On</HEAD>

 <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s top Mafia investigator has withdrawn his resignation, alleviating a crisis in the country's war on organized crime. <PERSON> Giovanni </PERSON> <PERSON> Falcone </PERSON>, an investigating magistrate in the Sicilian capital of <LOCATION> Palermo </LOCATION>, had charged when he offered his resignation July 30 that Mafia investigations were obstructed. He also said his methods `` differ radically'' from those of his superior, <PERSON> Antonino </PERSON> <PERSON> Meli </PERSON>, who was appointed chief investigating magistrate of the anti-Mafia judicial `` pool'' in February. <PERSON> Falcone </PERSON> asked for a transfer and the other members of the pool then announced their resignations. A former colleague of <PERSON> Falcone </PERSON> charged in July that <PERSON> Meli </PERSON> was weakening the pool by assigning its judges non-Mafia cases and sending Mafia cases to investigators outside the pool. <PERSON> Falcone </PERSON> told judicial officials Wednesday that he was staying on `` in conformance with the ruling'' last week by the <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magistrates </ORGANIZATION>, the national judicial watchdog that appointed <PERSON> Meli </PERSON>. The council, praising the pool's work, found that <PERSON> Meli </PERSON> did not divert cases and called on <PERSON> Falcone </PERSON> not to quit. Magistrates in the pool, especially <PERSON> Falcone </PERSON>, have been credited for some of the country's biggest successes against organized crime, including the `` maxi'' anti-Mafia trial that ended in December with 338 convictions. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities say <PERSON> Falcone </PERSON> provided critical help in investigations such as the one leading to the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> trial of suspects in the case of the `` Pizza Connection,'' which discovered that pizza parlors in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> were used as fronts for heroin dealing.

 Heavily armed police sealed off a 12-block area Wednesday night after hearing sporadic gunfire in a riot-scarred neighborhood where a white woman allegedly shot a black man to death 24 hours earlier. An emergency zone was expanded late Wednesday night in the <LOCATION> Cedar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION> section soon after police rerouted traffic off a busy thoroughfare where blacks were throwing rocks, bottles and bricks at passing cars. No injuries or serious damages were reported Wednesday night, and there were no arrests immediately reported in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s third-largest city The white woman was accused of murder in Tuesday night's shooting and six blacks were arrested during the rioting that followed, police said Mayor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussey </PERSON> said the strategy Wednesday night was to wait out troublemakers. Scores of police cars, a busload of camouflaged Special Response Team officers and canine units were stationed at a command post nearby. `` The shooting that we have is sporadic,'' said <PERSON> Hussey </PERSON>. `` It's still very much in a local area The idea is to seal off the area. If you seal it off, do n't let any cars through, then there's nothing for them to throw at. Though the atmosphere was tense, Police Chief <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Gruber </PERSON> said it was nothing like what the city faced after the earlier rioting. Wednesday night's violence occurred hours after black leaders called for <LOCATION> Cedar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION> residents to stay calm and guard against a recurrence of the burning and looting late Tuesday night and early Wednesday. `` We're sitting on a powder keg,'' said state Rep. <PERSON> Alphonse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who called for a biracial anti-crime committee. `` People want protection,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who is black. `` I call on citizens to restore law and order.'' His plea followed a meeting of city officials and black leaders to discuss the rioting that persisted nearly five hours, until 3 a.m. Wednesday, and which officials said was related both to drugs and racial problems. Stores were looted and burned, and rioters threw rocks and bottles at whites. There were reports of racial slurs and chants of `` Hot Biscuit,'' the restaurant where a white teen-ager killed a black teen-ager on Aug. 4, an incident that set off racial tension in this northwestern <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> city of 250,000, the state's third-largest after <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION> <PERSON> Hussey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gruber </PERSON> acknowledged at a news conference that the sparks for the riots were the two shootings, but both said there were deeper causes. `` We've got problems in our economy, we've got problems in our racism, we've got many other problems,'' said <PERSON> Hussey </PERSON>, adding that drinking and a soured drug deal preceded Tuesday's shooting. The Rev. <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, pastor of <ORGANIZATION> Galilee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, appeared with <PERSON> Hussey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gruber </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said he and other black leaders believe the chief deserves credit for ordering officers to pull out of the riot area so the crowd could disperse without bloodshed. `` We are asking our young people to remain at home as much as possible, to dig in to their books and not to look for any excitement,'' said <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's second-largest black Baptist organization. On Tuesday night, police cordoned off a seven-block area and warned motorists to keep out. The crowd reached 1,000 people at its peak, said <PERSON> Gruber </PERSON>, but other police estimates said the total was 300 to 500 most of the time. The police chief said his car took a brick through the windshield and gunfire through the back passenger door, but he was not hurt. A KTBS-TV news car was burned and a new fire department pumper was attacked with bats and bricks. No serious injuries were reported, attributed in part to <PERSON> Gruber </PERSON>'s decision to let the disturbance run its course. Throughout the incident, police radios crackled with orders to maintain positions and hold fire. `` If <PERSON> Gruber </PERSON> had moved into the area, we would have had a large number of people hurt, so I commend him for it,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` We chose to let it cool off,'' <PERSON> Gruber </PERSON> said. `` We felt our presence would do nothing but accelerate it.'' Six people were arrested, five on charges ranging from inciting to riot to resisting arrest, and two of those and one other person on on charges of possession of stolen goods. The outbreak was triggered by the shooting of a black man, identified as <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON>, 20, who lived in the <LOCATION> Cedar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION> neighborhood where the rioting took place. He was described by a witness as a bystander caught in gunfire when a drug deal went bad. A white teen-ager, <PERSON> Tamala </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vergo </PERSON>, 17, of <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON> was booked on a charge of second-degree murder, said police Cpl. E.T. Rushing. A second woman was questioned but not charged. A man who identified himself only as a cousin of <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON>'s named <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, said <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> was shot at random after a woman trying to buy cocaine from a group of men was robbed When they ran with her purse, she `` took out her frustration'' on <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON>, he said. The man talked to reporters after being interviewed by detectives. Officers said people in a convenience store tried to detain the woman until police came, but a crowd of blacks gathered outside and began throwing bricks at the business and all passing motorists who were white. A witness, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, said that after police took the women away, the crowd doused the store with lighter fluid, set it afire and went on a rampage. The building, containing the store and a liquor shop, was burned to the ground. Patients and workers at Eden Gardens Nursing Center, across the street, watched the burning and looting. `` Some of the guys had so much stuff in their bags they could n't walk,'' said <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Truett </PERSON>, a nurse Looting and fires also were reported in other stores in the area. About 200 police were called in, <PERSON> Gruber </PERSON> said, including state troopers, sheriff's deputies, and officers from nearby <LOCATION> Bossier </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. In the Aug. 4 shooting, five white men were arrested and one admitted the shooting, saying he was defending himself. He is being held on $ 250,000 bond on second-degree murder charges. Charges against three of the others were dropped in return for their cooperation. The shooting enraged <LOCATION> Shreveport </LOCATION>'s black community, but calm prevailed when black ministers exhorted congregations to let police handle the investigation.

<HEAD>Surprise: Summer Was Hot, Dry for Most Americans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When the autumn equinox bids farewell to summer today, millions of scorched Americans likely will be glad to see it go. It was a bummer summer, in the words of one headline writer, a season that saw millions of dollars lost in dying crops, rivers and reservoirs dry up and air conditioning bills go through the roof. According to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, only the Dust Bowl of the 1930s raised the nation's average temperature to higher levels than this summer Some communities may take pride in setting records for greatest average heat _ or most 90 degree days or least rain. But that does n't mean many want to see a return of the record-setting misery anytime soon. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> estimates that heat coupled with extraordinary dryness cut grain production by 31 percent, threatening many farmers with financial disaster. And the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey noted that low water levels curtailed irrigation and river traffic and raised pollution levels in some areas. Wildfires swept large areas, discouraging tourists, scorching homes and forests. And even something as simple as keeping cool had a significant impact, with the cost of running air conditioners pushing the national electric bill up to $ 14.4 billion, some $ 746 million more than it would have been in normal summer weather. National statistics, though, obscure the impact of the hot, dry season, which differed in degree and response from town to town, but which was bad news nearly everywhere. From <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION> the summer of 1988 was the hottest in local climate records going back nearly 40 years. And by that same standard, the drought played to record levels in <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, Billings, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Asheville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> `` Abnormally hot weather during much of June-August in the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION>, southern Intermountain Region, northern halves of the <ORGANIZATION> Rockies </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> sent seasonal temperatures averaging more than 4 degrees Fahrenheit above normal,'' the federal Climate Analysis Center said. The summer's greatest heat focused on the region from central <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> eastward to lower <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, with hundreds of record highs and many cities setting records for consecutive days of 90 degrees or more. It was the warmest summer in the last 58 years in the east north central states and the third warmest in the west north central region and the Mountain states. Drought, meanwhile, struck in the spring and persisted through much of the summer in the northern <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> valleys. By mid-July, about 45 percent of the 48 contiguous states were experiencing severe or extreme drought. Increased thunderstorm activity in the eastern portion of the drought area eased the problem somewhat in late July and August, but even so, several cities set records for dryness. Climate experts compile local records in 30-year chunks and use the period from 1951-1980 as a standard for comparison for current trends. They define summer as June, July and August. On that basis, at least seven cities recorded their driest summer.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More Americans have high school diplomas and college degrees than ever before, reflecting a continuing emphasis on education in society, a new <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> study shows. `` The entire post-Second World War era has been characterized by an expansion of educational opportunities and structures in the country,'' Census demographer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kominski </PERSON> commented. His new study of educational attainment found that, as of March 1987, more than three-quarters of people aged 25 and over have completed high school and nearly one in five has finished at least four years of college. Both shares have been increasing gradually over the years, said <PERSON> Kominski </PERSON>. `` In the 1960s the civil rights movement added another level of opportunity. And the expansion of college grant and aid programs in the'60s and'70s allowed this to continue,'' he said. <PERSON> Kominski </PERSON> added that changes in the age breakdown of the population have also had an impact on education averages, as the less educated elderly are replaced by younger people who have spent more time in school. For example, people in their teens, with 80 percent to 90 percent completing high school, are replacing older folks who were raised at a time when completion of six to eight years of schooling was a major accomplishment, he explained. Does this mean that Americans today are smarter than in the past? `` Not necessarily,'' <PERSON> Kominski </PERSON> said. `` We all like to think that we were raised in the generation which produced the best and the brightest.'' The study found that, overall, 75.6 percent of Americans have completed high school and 19.9 percent had finished four years of college. That was up from 74.7 percent and 19.4 percent a year earlier and 68.6 percent and 17.0 percent in 1980. By comparison, in 1940 only 24.5 percent of Americans aged 25 and older had completed high school and 4.6 percent were college graduates. The 1987 report also noted that males were slightly more likely to have finished high school than women, 76.0 percent to 75.3 percent, a change from the early 1970s when women led in this category. The shift is largely attributed to increasing share of black men pursuing their educations, <PERSON> Kominski </PERSON> said. In 1971, he pointed out, the last time women led men in overall share of high school graduates, young black women aged 25 to 29 led men 60.7 percent to 54.1 percent in high school graduates. Last year among young blacks 84.8 percent of males and 82.1 percent of women had finished high school. Other findings for the population aged 25 and over included: _ Whites had 77.0 percent high school graduates and 20.5 percent who finished four years of college. The figures for blacks were 63.4 percent and 10.7 percent. Other races, mostly Asians, had 78.4 percent high school grads and 33.4 percent who finished college. _ Hispanics recorded 50.9 percent who finished high school and 8.6 percent with college degrees. _ The West has the highest educational levels at 80.6 percent high school and 22.8 percent with college degrees. Figures for other regions were 76.5 percent and 22.2 percent in the East; 77.4 percent and 17.6 percent in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, and 70.8 percent and 18.3 percent in the South. _ In metropolitan areas 77.6 percent had finished high school and 22.1 percent college, compared to 68.7 percent and 12.6 percent in rural regions. _ The highest rate of high school graduates was for people aged 25 to 34 with 86.5 percent. That slipped to 85.9 percent in the 35 to 44 group, 77.6 percent for those aged 45 to 54, and 67.8 percent for people aged 55 to 64. Americans aged 65 to 74 included 56.9 percent high school graduates, and over age 75 the rate was 42.0 percent. _ Those finishing college totaled 23.9 percent in the 25 to 34 age group, then peaked at 26.5 percent among people aged 35 to 44. After that the rate declined, to 19.5 percent for those aged 45 to 54, 14.9 percent for the 55 to 64 group, 10.6 percent for those 65 to 74, and over 75 it was 8.9 percent.

<TEXT>
 Nightclubs and nudity are banned on this island where tradition holds that St. <PERSON> John </PERSON> wrote the New Testament's Book of Revelation in a cave overlooking the <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. Under a special government decree, <LOCATION> Patmos </LOCATION> has a unique status among <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>'s 200 or so inhabited islands as a `` holy island'' still dominated by its 900-year-old Byzantine monastery. `` We prefer our visitors to be pilgrims rather than ordinary tourists and we would like them to respect our tradition,'' <PERSON> Abbot </PERSON> <PERSON> Isidoros </PERSON>, who heads the 30-member community at the Monastery of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> the Theologian, said in an interview. But plans for an airport coupled with widespread publicity for the monastery's 900th anniversary celebrations are expected to bring mass tourism to <LOCATION> Patmos </LOCATION> in the coming years. The tranquillity of <LOCATION> Patmos </LOCATION>, a rocky outcrop in the Dodecanese group of islands with around 2,000 residents, attracts wealthy Greeks and foreigners who have restored scores of traditional mansions clustered beneath the monastery's gray fortress-like walls. Many have given donations to the monastery, to help maintain its library of rare manuscripts and early books, along with a collection of priceless icons _ portraits of saints painted in gold and bright colors. `` <LOCATION> Patmos </LOCATION> is still a place apart, with a unique atmosphere. Unlike other islands, a conscious effort has been made to protect it,'' said <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Constantinides </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> antiques dealer with a family home there. Signs in Greek, French, German or English scattered around the island's beaches point out that nudity is not allowed. One disco operates on a remote bay, but the narrow alleys around the monastery fall silent by 10 p.m., even in summer. `` People sometimes go topless on the beaches, but ... on the whole the rules are respected,'' said <PERSON> Christos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyrozis </PERSON>, the island's doctor and also its mayor. The development project planned by <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>'s state tourist organization EOT, together with the monastery and town authorities, calls for construction of an airport, zoning for new hotels and bungalows and improved harbor facilities. `` Past experience shows that once an island gets an airport, mass tourism is very difficult to avoid,'' said <PERSON> Eleni </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonou </PERSON>, who heads the project. `` But an airport is essential because it serves the islanders first.'' More than 30,000 visitors come to <LOCATION> Patmos </LOCATION> every year, but two-thirds of them arrive aboard cruise ships that steam away before sunset after a few hours' stay. On an island too barren to grow its own food, visitors are the only source of income apart from fishing. `` There's a delicate balance to be kept between God and mammon on this island,'' Mayor <PERSON> Kyrozis </PERSON> said. `` There has to be tourism, but not so much it kills what we have to offer.'' Trained for a more secluded life, the monks say it's already hard work taking turns to supervise the tourists swarming through the monastery museum, its frescoed chapels and stone colonnades. `` The sheer numbers of people coming through mean that we're exhausted by the time the season's over and there's time to get on with our own tasks,'' said <PERSON> Brother </PERSON> <PERSON> Chrysostomos </PERSON>, the monastery librarian The tourists also crowd into the Monastery of the Apocalypse, built over the cave where <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> supposedly wrote his visionary work while exiled on <LOCATION> Patmos </LOCATION> around A.D. 95. `` It's historical fact that St. <PERSON> John </PERSON> was on the island,'' said <PERSON> Athanassios </PERSON> <PERSON> Kominis </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Athens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor of Byzantine studies. `` The tradition that he wrote Revelation there is certainly more than speculation, but not quite certainty,'' Patriarch <PERSON> Dimitrios </PERSON>, spiritual leader of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christians </ORGANIZATION> worldwide, plans to lead Orthodox, Roman Catholic and <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> churchmen in a two-day international pilgrimage to <LOCATION> Patmos </LOCATION> Sept. 25-26. It celebrates the 900th birthday of the Monastery of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION>, founded in 1088 by a Byzantine scholar, the Blessed Christodoulos with special permission from the Emperor <PERSON> Alexius </PERSON> <PERSON> Comnenos </PERSON>.

<HEAD>House Considering Measure To Revoke Drug Users' Drivers' Licenses</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After expressing a mood that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> wo n't tolerate any illegal narcotics use, lawmakers may be ready to toughen anti-drug legislation by voting to revoke drug users' drivers' As the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> returns to its comprehensive anti-drug bill today, lawmakers face two opposing amendments that could affect any convicted drug offender's right to drive. Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> McCollum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Fla </LOCATION>., proposes withholding part of a state's federal highway money unless the state requires suspension or revocation of drivers' licenses of anyone convicted of a drug-related crime A substitute amendment by Rep. <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., provides an incentive approach Instead of penalties, states would receive <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> grants for imposing the license penalties. The grants would pay part of the license enforcement program. The overall anti-drug bill would add some $ 2 billion to the nation's $ 3.9 billion effort against illegal drugs. While the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> expects to approve the legislation Thursday or Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> still must consider its own drug bill. A conference will almost certainly be needed to iron out differences, but lawmakers appear eager to pass a popular get-tough-on-drugs bill so close to the election. The House bill, as originally written, authorizes money and innovative programs for drug law enforcement, rehabilitation, treatment and education. Each time the House has amended the measure during the past two weeks, it's civil, administrative, or criminal penalties have toughened. Under <PERSON> McCollum </PERSON>'s driver's license plan, states would have to impose suspensions of at least six months for a first conviction and at least one year for repeat convictions within a five-year period. Five percent of a state's highway money would be withheld the first year if there was no compliance, and 10 percent would be held back for every subsequent year of non-compliance. The penalty for states would begin Oct. 1, 1991. Individuals penalized would have to have been convicted after the drug measure became law. The Anderson alternative would require the same six-month and one-year penalties as required under the <PERSON> McCollum </PERSON> plan. The incentive program would offer states additional money totaling $ 25 million in the 1989 fiscal year, $ 50 million in 1990 and $ 50 million in 1991. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s proposal also would apply to those convicted after the drug bill became law. Over the past two weeks, the House has inserted a number of amendments to the drug bill that reflect an attitude of `` zero tolerance'' toward any drug use, and a feeling that harsh penalties are needed for those who deal in drugs or merely possess them. Liberal lawmakers have complained that the House has ignored the Constitutional safeguards that protect civil liberties such as due process of law. Amendments already approved would: _ Permit the federal death penalty for anyone who intentionally kills a person during the course of committing a drug felony _ Deny many federal benefits, including assistance to Veterans and student loans, to anyone convicted of two or more drug-related offenses _ Allow introduction of evidence in federal criminal cases that was obtained through a search that violated constitutional protections, but undertaken in good faith _ Create civil penalties of up to $ 10,000 per violation for possession of small `` personal use'' amounts of marijuana, cocaine and other drugs The House also approved a requirement for a system that would allow gun dealers to identify convicted felons attempting to buy handguns. This amendment replaced language for a seven-day waiting period for handgun purchases.

<HEAD>Izvestia Says Grain Harvest Down This Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s grain harvest this year will be smaller than the relatively good harvests of the two previous years because of drought in the country's breadbasket, <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> reported. The Soviet government newspaper gave no figures, but said the harvest was just drawing to a close and it was clear it would fall short of the 231 million tons harvested in each of the past two years. A significant shortfall in the grain harvest would be a blow to Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s efforts to improve food supplies to consumers and reform agriculture. It also would require the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to use more of its scare foreign currency to buy grain instead of machinery and equipment to modernize the economy. `` The summer drought has inflicted an appreciable blow on the principle grainaries of the country _ the <LOCATION> Volga </LOCATION> region, the Urals, western <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said in the report Wednesday. It said experts of the government's giant agro-industrial complex had determined `` the grain procurements as a whole around the country will be somewhat lower than the level of the two previous years.'' <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said that although it was reporting bad news, it was a sign of progress in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> society that the news about such a sensitive area of Soviet life could be reported at all. Last year's harvest was considered by Western observers to be good because the growing season was unusually damp and cool. Figures for 1986 and 1987 were well above the average for 1981-1985 of about 203.5 million tons but well below official targets, which Western observers consider unrealistic. The 1986 target was 255 million tons, and Soviet officials are trying to boost that to 275 million tons over several years' time. Western experts say the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> uses about 240-255 million tons of grain a year and must import what it can not produce. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is trying to reform Soviet agriculture by giving families and small brigades of farm workers more responsibility and greater security on the huge state and collective farms. The Soviet leader hopes to encourage farmers to work harder by offering them a chance to earn more money and live better.

 `` The planes dropped bombs,'' the Kurdish survivor said. `` They did not produce a big noise. A yellowish cloud was created and there was a smell of rotten parsley or onions. There were no wounds. People would breathe the smoke, then fall down and blood would come from their mouths.'' The speaker, one of 200 Kurdish refugees interviewed in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> earlier this month by two members of the staff of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, identified himself as a member of the Kurdish insurgent forces fighting <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s government. The staff investigators, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Galbraith </PERSON> and <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollen </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, called the refugee accounts, describing attacks on more than 30 villages, persuasive and said the symptoms they reported are `` classically associated with mustard gas poisoning.'' While acknowledging that some of the witnesses obviously were biased against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, the two staff members concluded: `` To dismiss the eyewitness accounts would require one to believe that 65,000 Kurdish refugees confined to five disparate locations were able to organize a conspiracy in 15 days to defame <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and that these refugees were able to keep their conspiracy a secret not only from us but from the world press.'' Kurds, a nomadic Moslem people, have fought unsuccessfully for years to gain autonomy for their region within <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Kurdistan </LOCATION> also extends into parts of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. Citing the interviews and other evidence, <PERSON> Galbraith </PERSON> and <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollen </PERSON> concluded that `` overwhelming evidence exists'' that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> subjected Kurdish villages to three days of poison gas attacks last month. In a report to Foreign Relations Chairman <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, they conclude that the attacks were part of a deliberate policy by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to depopulate the Kurdish regions of the country. `` We find no question that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s policy in <LOCATION> Kurdistan </LOCATION> has the characteristics of genocide,'' the staff investigators said. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, prompted by earlier reports of Iraqi attacks against the Kurds, is debating legislation to impose economic sanctions on the <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> government. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> already has approved sanctions legislation against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, earlier accused of using mustard gas against attacking Iranian soldiers, has denied it employed chemical weapons against the Kurds or anyone else. The Foreign Relations staff report uses dozens of eyewitness accounts of the alleged chemical attacks against the Kurds to paint a graphic narrative. `` As described by the villagers, the bombs that fell on the morning of August 25 did not produce a loud explosion,'' the report said. `` Only a weak sound could be heard and then a yellowish cloud spread out from the center of the explosion and became a thin mist. The air became mixed with a mixture of smells _ ` bad garlic,' ` rotten onions' and ` bad apples.'' `` Those who were very close to the bombs died instantly,'' the report said. `` Those who did not die instantly found it difficult to breathe and began to vomit. The gas stung the eyes, skin and lungs of the villagers exposed to it. Many suffered temporary blindness.'' `` After the bombs exploded, many villagers ran and submerged their faces in nearby streams to escape the spreading gas. Many of those who made it to the streams survived. Those who could not run from the growing smell, mostly the very old and the very young, died. `` The survivors who saw the dead reported that blood could be seen trickling out of the mouths of some of the bodies,'' the report said. `` A yellowish fluid could also be seen oozing out of the noses and mouths of some of the dead. Some said the bodies appeared frozen. Many of the dead bodies turned blackish blue. `` Most of the villagers quickly abandoned the contaminated areas, leaving the bodies unburied in the sun,'' the report said. `` In some cases they later returned to the poisoned villages to bury the bodies. ... `` In every village where chemical bombs were dropped, the livestock _ mostly donkeys and goats _ died,'' the report said. `` Birds are also reported to have ` fallen out of the sky.' Bees in the area are also said to have been killed by the gas.'' <PERSON> Galbraith </PERSON> and <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollen </PERSON> say the chemical attacks on Kurdish villages continued on Aug. 26 and Aug. 27 and they concluded that `` no area in the northeastern reaches of <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kurdistan </LOCATION> was safe from chemical attack.'' Thousands of Kurds fled across the border into <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, but on Aug. 28 the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> army blocked a road parallel to the border, trapping Kurdish villagers inside <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, the report said. `` An Iraqi Kurd who managed to cross the road said, ` Whatever they saw they shot _ children, women, young and old,'' the report said. It said that by Sept. 5 the Iraqi army had set up camps along the border, slowing the flow of refugees to a trickle. `` In at least one village where Kurds remained _ the village of <LOCATION> Baze </LOCATION> _ survivors report <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> forces opened fire with machine guns on everyone in the village and then used bulldozers to push the bodies into mass graves,'' the report stated.

 Residents of <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> tried to go about business as usual Wednesday despite a fiery reminder that their small town on the edge of the <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> remains under siege by an arsonist. At 10:10 Tuesday night, volunteer firefighters rushed to a burning unoccupied log cabin _ the 20th suspicious fire in the town of 900 since early May, but the first since Aug. 23. `` It's gone on so long now that people are making the effort to live each day as it comes, and live their normal lives,'' said state Sen. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> resident. `` People had been trying to relax and hope that it is over,'' <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> said. `` There's a feeling of disappointment, I'm sure.'' The fire extensively damaged the interior of the cabin, which is about 10 miles from the center of town. Most residents have tired of talking about their ordeal and shrug off questions from reporters. But a phone call to the general store Wednesday morning revealed that residents were talking among themselves about the latest fire. Except for several cases of smoke inhalation, there have been no injuries in the house and brush fires. But several families have been left homeless and townspeople are fearful and angry. Many, with weapons ready, have taken to keeping watch over their homes all night. The <ORGANIZATION> Jefferson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firemen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> has raised $ 5,000 for a reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction. Firefighters only hope it is n't a neighbor, or a good friend. State Fire Marshal <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Toland </PERSON> said he has received calls from current and former firefighting authorities throughout <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> with the names of known arsonists, and the possibility that one might be living in the <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> area. `` It takes time to check them all out,'' he said. The investigation has progressed, he said, declining to say more. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, a national arson expert who spent 23 years with the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and has investigated 10,000 fires, expects the fires to continue `` until they catch him. If he's not scared off by now, it's kind of a ` try and catch me' thing,'' he said `` When you have multiple fires, and have no leads, the person who is setting the fires has to continue setting them for you to catch them.'' <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> authorities have `` just got to get lucky. They have a monster,'' he said. Bond and King point to the surrounding wilderness and sparse population as impediments to catching the arsonist with match in hand. There is no realistic way to patrol the area, <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> said of the town's 100 square miles. `` There are so many areas where they can do what they do and just melt into the woods,'' <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. `` How can you patrol the area around <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>?'' In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the population is more dense and there are more sources of information, <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. `` In the city, there's always that little old lady who sits up all night and sees everything.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Reagan Pictured as Great Friend of United
Nations</HEAD>
<HEAD>By W. DALE NELSON</HEAD>
<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, a sharp critic of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> during much of his administration, is being pictured by his aides as one of the world body's stoutest champions as he prepares to say his <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> farewells. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will make what is expected to be his final appearance before the international forum in a visit Monday and Tuesday for the opening of the annual General Assembly session in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Aides say he will deliver a major speech that may outline new proposals designed to deal with world trouble spots. It will be his sixth speech to a regular <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> session, or his seventh counting a 1982 appearance at a special session on disarmament. It has been heralded with unaccustomed hoopla _ a press briefing on Tuesday by Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Rozanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridgeway </PERSON> and another one on Wednesday by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s national security adviser, <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>. `` Well, it's an important two-day event, and we know you'd like to have as many briefings as possible,'' <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> explained. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> told reporters that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s involvement in <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> activities has been `` unprecedented for an American president.'' `` As a result of the president's involvement, I think it is fair to say that our relations with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> are excellent, better than they have been for a long time,'' the national security adviser said. In his previous appearances, however, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> often had criticized the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>, calling for reforms in its budgetary and hiring practices. On Sept. 13, the White House announced that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would release $ 188 million that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had withheld from the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> because of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> misgivings about the way the organization was run. The president also said he would seek full funding for the next fiscal year. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said these payments have begun. The national security adviser also said, however, that more than just budget reform is involved in the president's new warmth toward the international organization. `` The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> has started to play a more important role around the world in helping to deal with regional conflicts,'' he said. `` They are really doing what we always hoped they would do.'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said the president's address Monday would be `` a major foreign policy speech, broad in scope. ... It will be forward looking even as it reflects on past accomplishments.'' `` We have a couple of new initiatives under consideration ... to help deal with some of the regional conflict issues around the world,'' he added. He also said he expects that the issue of chemical warfare will come up in some of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s discussions with foreign leaders and that the issue might also be covered in the speech. On Monday night, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will be host at a reception for heads of state and other dignitaries. `` It will be sort of a farewell to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> members,'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said. `` His criticism has produced results,'' he said, `` and he is acknowledging that there have been results. He's essentially taking a snapshot, in what he has done last week and the speech, of where the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> is now and where the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> can go in the future.''

 Authorities executed a <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> man convicted of robbing tourists including a visitor from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> who was forced to surrender a camera and $ 820 in yen, a newspaper reported today.

The daily said the robbers were armed with a dagger. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> usually metes out harsh punishment for crimes in which foreigners are victimized, and there have been several cases of the death sentence being given to Chinese who attack or rob foreigners. Execution is normally by a bullet to the back of the head.

<TEXT>
 At age 70, news commentator <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> is about to become a museum piece, but he is n't letting that interfere with his three daily radio shows, his newspaper column or his speaking tours. `` Tomorrow's the most exciting day in world to me,'' <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> said recently, and he has plenty of tomorrows planned _ new directions for his syndicated television program, a new second home and studio in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> and adding a helicopter rating to his aviation licenses. On Saturday, he is to be inducted into <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>. `` I wo n't retire until I find something that's more fun to do,'' <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> said, gesturing around his office-studio, decorated with civic awards, keys to cities and cartoons. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> got his start at 15 with radio station <ORGANIZATION> KVOO </ORGANIZATION> in his native <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>. His name was <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Aurandt </PERSON> back then, and it remained so through stints in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kalamazoo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich </LOCATION> He changed it on taking his first <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> job in 1944. Now, when he says `` Good morning, Americans, this is <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>,'' he speaks to an estimated 22 million listeners on 1,348 radio stations, but <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> tries to concentrate on one person. `` I'm usually talking to my wife's sister,'' <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> said. `` She seems to epitomize grass-roots America to me. I keep asking myself, ` Would Aunt <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> really care? Would Aunt <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> really understand?' A lot of stories get rewritten or discarded because of that.'' <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> shrugs off such adjectives as `` cornball'' and criticism of his format, in which ominous headlines are often juxtaposed with cute animal stories and <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>'s comments. `` Hard, cold facts have to be made palatable with some leavening _ but you ca n't use too much of that leavening. No one wants to listen to just good news, after all _ it's been tried and it does n't work.'' He also does his own commercials, delivering them in the same tone of voice as the news itself. The practice is a <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> trademark _ and he defends it, saying, `` I use the products myself and I can vouch for them.'' Interviewer and Pulitzer Prize-winning author <PERSON> Studs </PERSON> <PERSON> Terkel </PERSON>, who has been on <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> radio since 1945, says he understands <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>'s popularity, but does not necessarily approve of the reasons `` At a certain point in the New Deal and a certain point in the war, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said the usual, expected things,'' <PERSON> Terkel </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> was offering pretty simplistic views, and they caught on like a house afire, I guess they were what some people wanted to hear.'' `` He's a nice guy, a very honest guy and a very fair-minded guy,'' said <PERSON> Terkel </PERSON>. `` I like him very much personally, but I do n't have much in common with his views In some ways, he's confined his mind to the 12th century _ and it's not the 12th century anymore. He sees things in blacks and whites, and the world is more complex than he realizes.'' <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>'s family _ he and wife <PERSON> Lynne </PERSON> have been married 47 years _ has sometimes influenced his broadcasts, as when he reversed himself on the Vietnam War. He signaled the shift in a broadcast that opened: `` I love you, Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, but you're wrong ...'' `` I changed my mind about <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> after a painful period of several months of soul-searching and discussions _ often around our own dinner table,'' he said. `` My son, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, was exempt, but he felt so strongly about the war that he chose to announce himself as a conscientious objector anyway.'' It was the Cold War that brought <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> to national prominence. Working as an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> radio commentator in 1951, he was arrested on orders of the <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> for scaling a fence and surreptitiously entering <ORGANIZATION> Argonne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>, west of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> said it was investigative journalism and proved that security was lax at the <ORGANIZATION> AEC </ORGANIZATION>'s nuclear facilities; the <ORGANIZATION> AEC </ORGANIZATION> called it breaking and entering. `` No indictment was filed, but <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> had me picking barbed wire out of my britches for about a decade,'' <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> recalled. Having supported such political opposites as Sens. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Fulbright </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> says he once considered himself a conservative but can no longer define himself politically. `` Basically, I believe in Big People, as opposed to Big Government _ to the extent that a sardine society will allow,'' he said.

<HEAD>Collapse Of Center Evident As Political Season Opens</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Thursday AMs report.</NOTE>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The political season got into full swing this week, but it was starkly clear that the center can not hold. Three years after outstripping Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> in opinion polls and promising to break the mold of British politics, the two center parties have been shunted to the sidelines. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> once again appears to be a two-party state _ the governing Conservatives, who are to meet Oct. 11-14, and the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, whose convention is Oct. 2-7. The <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, led <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, who is often rated the most formidable politician in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> after Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, ended its four-day convention Tuesday just barely alive. The newly-formed Social and <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is not in much better condition before its meeting Sept. 24-29 in the seaside resort of <LOCATION> Blackpool </LOCATION>. The party, a merger of <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberals </ORGANIZATION>, once looked like it could turn British politics into a three-way race. The alliance polled 22.5 percent of the vote in the last general election in June 1987. Today, the two parties are fighting their political battles separately and ca n't reach even double digits in popular support. Recent polls show only 9 percent support for the Social and <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> and 4 percent for the Social Democrats. The former political allies have become victims of unkind jokes and public indifference. Most analysts believe their main significance lies in their capacity to snatch just enough votes from <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> to ensure Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> an unprecedented fourth consecutive term in the next election. The <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has only three members in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. Except for <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, a national figure with a big following in his district of <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION>, the legislators may well lose their seats in the next elections. `` Perhaps -LRB- <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> will -RRB- reflect ... on the hopes thrown away and the opportunities bungled,'' lamented the liberal Guardian newspaper. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, 50, the former foreign secretary once tipped for the premiership, rallied only a handful of loyalists to debate apartheid, nuclear weapons and British shopping hours at the party convention this week in <LOCATION> Torquay </LOCATION>, a south <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> coastal resort. Three years ago the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> gave <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>' party conference full and live television coverage, just like the Conservative, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> and Liberal party conferences. The atmosphere was heady. This year, the trappings remained _ cameras, reporters, agendas, resolutions _ but the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> covered less than half the proceedings and delayed screening <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>'s keynote address because it clashed with the Olympics. `` -LRB- The centrist parties -RRB- do n't speak to a clear constituency and their support has generally been negative _ from people who do n't like the Tories or do n't like Labor rather than having any clear perception of what the center's policies are,'' political analyst <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Keliner </PERSON> said in an interview In most other West European countries, center parties thrive, often in coalition governments under electoral systems that allocate parliamentary seats according to the percentage of the vote won. In <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, a legislator wins only when he wins his district. `` Fundamentally, the British electoral system operates against center parties,'' <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> appealed in vain to the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> for a new voting system less harsh on small parties. `` Does the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> go on vainly pretending that they can challenge and beat the Conservatives outright?'' he asked. The Social and <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> controls 19 seats in the 650-member <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>, compared with the Conservatives' 374 and Labor's 228. The experiment in centrist politics began in 1981, when disenchanted Laborites broke away to form the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The same year, the new party formed an alliance with the Liberals, a party started in 1828 that once governed the country but was reduced to a minority. In the 1983 election, the two-party alliance made an impressive debut, capturing one-fourth of the vote. Four years later, its share of the vote fell. The alliance promptly split after its Liberal co-leader, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Steel </PERSON>, demanded a formal merger, arguing that a two-headed party had no chance. The merger, which resulted in the Social and <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, was finalized in March 1988 after months of political infighting. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> has remained with what is left of the original <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Steel </PERSON> retired and was succeeded by <PERSON> Paddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashdown </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> legislator. `` Today, as a result, we see Dr. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, a leader without a party worth the name -LRB- and -RRB- the Social and <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, a party devoid of leaders worth the name,'' commented <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, columnist in the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> newspaper, the Independent.

<HEAD>Report Says CIA Allowed Chopper Smuggling by North Korea</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> let <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> agents smuggle high-performance <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> helicopters out of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and withheld the information from law enforcement officials for nearly a year, according to an <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> report. The agency was aware during the operation that shipments of the aircraft were being made through a West German trucking company between 1983 and 1985, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. Authorities told <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> the trucking company had been bugged, and the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> had listened to North Korean agents plan details of the smuggling operation. The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> believed its source of information was so sensitive that passing on details to law enforcement agencies might compromise <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agents in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> reported. <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Devine </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the agency had no comment on the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> report. `` We neither confirm nor deny the report,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> told NBC: `` This is the kind of thing we've got to stop. Very damaging, no question.'' The North Koreans protected their investment by obtaining a <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> insurance policy against confiscation of the helicopters, according to the report. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> said it obtained a copy of the policy which contained details of the smuggling routes from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The choppers took a circuitous route that included stops in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. Authorities in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> discovered the smuggling operation and seized the last shipment of 15 helicopters in 1985, but <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON>, the lead <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs agent on the case, told NBC: `` Had different information been passed along, perhaps these shipments could have been stopped.'' The helicopters were Hughes 500E models, commercial versions of the choppers used by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces to raid an Iranian ship caught laying mines in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> supplies the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> army the same kind of helicopters to defend itself against <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Last Feb. 10, two brothers from <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> pleaded guilty to charges in connection with illegally diverting aircraft to a communist country. `` The evidence at trial was that these two defendants knew from the beginning that these helicopters were going to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, that they secretly owned the West German company that did the deal and that they hid the profits in Swiss bank accounts,'' Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Modisett </PERSON> said when the men were sentenced in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Semler </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION> was sentenced to pay a $ 40,000 fine and serve three years in federal prison. His brother, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Semler </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>, was fined $ 40,000 and sentenced to one year in prison.

 Education Secretary <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> may have only four months on the job, but he says he'll use the time to fight the dropout rate and advocate education for all. The first Hispanic member of a president's <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> said he is concerned about keeping all students in school, and points to a Hispanic dropout rate of about 30 percent. `` We ca n't afford to lose that many people,'' <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> told a news conference Wednesday, his first day on the job, as he answered questions in Spanish. <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> said his mission would be to `` get out there ... and really have people understand the seriousness of the issue. We've got to start now We ca n't delay. We've waited too long.'' To get his message across, <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> said he would meet with local officials, professional education societies, and members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` The next few months will give us the forum to talk about the issues that are vital to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` How do we position this country, this nation, to really be competitive at the turn of the century ... and I do n't just mean economically. `` Rather, let us look to make sure every person in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> today is educated to his or her full potential. My interest is to awaken <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to recall that our strength really has come because we had an educated electorate,'' <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> was confirmed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and sworn in Tuesday by Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> said he had `` struck absolutely no deal'' with the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> presidential nominee to remain in office if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wins the November election. `` We never even discussed the possibility of my staying beyond the January date,'' said <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>, who is taking a leave of absence from his job as president of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and its medical school. But some Republicans have said they would n't mind seeing <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> in the next administration, and Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> told fellow Republicans last week that Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., leaned over to him at the end of <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>' confirmation hearing and said that if <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is elected `` I'm going to talk him into keeping him on as secretary of education. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday that <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> `` has the perspective to be a superb secretary of education.''

 A consumer group is asking the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to investigate the fitness of <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> because of a series of impending financial transactions critics say threaten the carrier's financial health. The petition by the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> maintains that plans to convert <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> into a private company would saddle the airline with $ 2.3 billion in debt and declining assets because more than $ 700 million in <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s cash could be used in the transaction. <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> earlier this month won investor support for the stock deal which would allow <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> to recover his $ 440 million investment and control 90 percent of <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s stock through a new holding company. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> now owns about 77 percent of the airline. The petition filed by the consumer group claims <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> could be put `` on the brink of bankruptcy'' by the transaction, which also has been denounced by <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s unions. A suit filed by the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> asks that the court prevent <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> `` from looting <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'' through the stock transaction plan. It maintains that <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> will `` strip <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> of $ 665 million'' and threaten the airline's economic future The Consumer Federation told the department that air travelers holding nearly $ 500 million in advance and unused tickets as well as credits on <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> frequent flyer programs stand to loose substantial amounts should <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> go bankrupt or be forced to cut service or routes. The federation alleged that <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, who purchased <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 when it was near collapse, has run up large debts at the company while holding on to large amounts of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. But the petition alleges most of those cash assets will be wiped out in the stock transaction. `` The precarious financial structure after this -LRB- transaction -RRB- raises serious questions about whether the airline will be able to meet its financial and quality of service obligations to the public,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, director of research for the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>. `` After running up huge amounts of debt, the Icahn-led group now proposes to take all its money and then some out of <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>, leave the company with absolutely no equity and leave the airline on the brink of bankruptcy,'' he continued. Furthermore, the federation maintained that consumers are `` virtual captives of <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'' because of its domination in several cities, such as <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, where more than 80 percent of all flights are operated by <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>. `` The failure of the airline or a significant reduction in service would have a devastating impact on these consumers who have few alternatives for air travel,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Cooper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> did not immediately return calls seeking comment Wednesday. Earlier this week the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, found that <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> had achieved dominant control of airport traffic in and out of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> since it acquired <ORGANIZATION> Ozark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> two years ago. Ozark had been <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s biggest competitor at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosely </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the petition was still being reviewed. `` We are expecting some decision fairly soon,'' he said. Earlier this year the department launched an in-depth examination of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the holding company of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, after questions were raised about the company's financial dealings. No irregularities were found at <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> is performing a delicate balancing act between East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> as it opens its doors to the business and technology of the capitalist world. <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> has extended a diplomatic hand to many nations the rest of the <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> keeps at a distance. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> is the first <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc nation that is to normalize diplomatic ties with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The announcement was made in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> on Sept. 13, but no date has been set. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Istvan </PERSON> <PERSON> Komoroczki </PERSON> said the move was `` in harmony with a Hungarian drive to openness to the world, irrespective of social systems. In the same week, <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> also became the first Eastern bloc nation to agree to resume diplomatic ties with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, severed after the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. After a private visit to <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> Sept. 14-15, Israeli Premier <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, the first <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> head of goverment to visit <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would renew full diplomatic ties with <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> `` in the near future.'' No date was set. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> became party boss in May and immediately embarked on a series of trips to the West, including visits to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The communist leader has emphasized <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s need for Western technology and investments that would reverse its economic slump and allow it to begin chipping at an $ 18 billion foreign debt `` I hardly think I have to reiterate the importance to the life and development of this country of mutually advantageous external economic relations,'' <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> told the English-language official <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> last week. After being named <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s premier in June 1987, <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> also visited <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in October of that year and <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> in November. But the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader has been careful not to neglect or antagonize his Soviet bloc allies as he opens his country to capitalitstic influences, unlike <LOCATION> Romanian </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, whose maverick policies won him Western support in the 1970s but irritated <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. In a balancing move, <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> made a quick visit to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> before his 10-day <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tour in July, apparently to win Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s support for his overtures toward the West. While visiting <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in September, <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> emphasized the need to boost economic relations between the two countries, although <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> has balked at <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s proposed reforms. <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> also has refrained from criticizing <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, although Hungarian activists oppose a joint hydroelectric project on the <LOCATION> Danube </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> that links them. When relations between <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> hit an all-time low this summer in the wake of <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>'s alleged discrimination against its 1.7 million minority Hungarians, <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> on Aug. 28. The Hungarian leader drew criticism at home for his failure to persuade the Romanian government to scrap its plan to raze thousands of villages inhabited by the Hungarian minority. A Western analyst in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, with its good human rights record and liberal policies, has presented itself to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> as `` user-friendly.'' At the same time, <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> seems to have <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s approval in pursuing whatever foreign policy it chooses _ as long as they do n't damage its ties to the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact alliance This independence began long before <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, but it received a boost when the two leaders came to power. In 1985, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> was the East bloc host of a 35-nation cultural forum under the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> human rights accords. In March 1987, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> became the first East bloc country to join the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> in backing a minority rights resolution at the <ORGANIZATION> Vienna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> on Security and Cooperation in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. More recently, <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> was the site Aug. 30-31 of a closed-door meeting of arms experts from <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact, and it has offered to host a Soviet-U.S. summit. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s joint bid with <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> to host the 1995 World's Fair in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> has strengthened the impression that <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> is seeking a role similar to that of neutral <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, a center of East-West contacts.

<HEAD>Delta Crash Investigations Study Tapes for Sound of Flap Settings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Investigators of last month's <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> crash in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> are trying to determine whether several `` click'' sounds on the jet's cockpit voice recorder are indications the flight crew set the flaps before takeoff. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 crashed seconds after taking off from the <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> airport Aug. 31, killing 14 of the 108 people aboard. The investigation has focused on whether a false flap setting may have kept the plane from gaining altitude. At least two clicks can be heard on the recording, according to sources close to the investigation. But additional sounds also are being studied to determine the exact number of clicks and whether they relate directly to the flaps' position. The flaps, which provide an aircraft with lift during takeoff, were supposed to have been set at 15 degrees for proper takeoff of Flight 1141. The Dallas Morning News on Wednesday quoted <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> officials it did not name as saying they were studying the possibility that the flaps were extended, but not far enough. `` What you hear -LRB- on the tape of the cockpit conversation -RRB- are two ` clicks' in quick succession. That means that the flaps were at least at the 5-degree setting,'' the newspaper quoted one source as saying. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 has flap settings of 2, 5 and 15 degrees. The flap control mechanism in the cockpit has notches that produce clicking sounds as the lever is moved. Meanwhile, investigators are expected to conduct tests in flight simulators to determine what minimum flap setting would have been required for the plane to gain proper lift. Some aviation experts who have followed the accident investigation say the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727, which was not fully loaded, should have been able to take off even with a lower than optimum flap setting. <PERSON> Drucella </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday the safety board would have no comment on what investigators are examining on the cockpit voice recorder tapes. Investigators have uncovered conflicting evidence as to the jet's flap setting at the time of takeoff. The voice recorder shows the co-pilot acknowledged having set the flaps to 15 degrees during the routine preflight checklist. `` Fifteen, fifteen, green,'' the co-pilot was heard to say on the cockpit recorder tape, according to sources involved in the investigation. One source suggested that the co-pilot, if he set the flaps, probably did so earlier and was reading off the flap setting at the time his response was recorded. The reference to `` green'' refers to a light showing the position of separate control surfaces on the forward edge of the wings called slats. A green light shows them to be in the extended position. Slats also are supposed to be extended during takeoff, but investigators have said they found the slats on the wrecked aircraft in an unlocked but retracted position. Investigators have said the jack screws on the wings also indicated the flaps were in a retracted position and the flap-slat control lever in the cockpit was found in an up position, indicating the flaps were retracted. The co-pilot who was responsible for setting the flaps has told investigators he can not remember anything after the aircraft was pushed back from the gates.

<HEAD>Nevada Senate Campaign Turns Bitter, Political Trickery Charged</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As Republican Sen. Chic <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON> struggles to hold his seat against a strong challenge from Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, their battle has turned bitter with party and campaign officials making accusations on usually-untouchable subjects such as <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>'s sex life and <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON>'s intelligence. On the surface, <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON> have been debating one another on familiar themes _ a possible nuclear dump in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, defense spending, conservative vs. liberal philosophies and balanced budgets. <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON>, 59, has sought to link <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> to organized labor in this state of legalized gambling as well as tie the Democrat to the liberal views of presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. He also has accused <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> of deserting voters who elected him to a second four-year term as governor in 1986. In turn, <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, 51, has attacked <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON> for flip-flops on the nuclear waste dump, for voting against <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> increases, and for being generally ineffective. He also points to poll after poll showing him with a comfortable lead over the one-term incumbent. And both have been publicly critical of another level of the campaign in which top party officials and key campaign staffers have accused one another of `` dirty tricks.'' <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> blasted <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Ivy </PERSON> for `` a despicable campaign tactic'' in mentioning on a radio talk show that there have been rumors about <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>'s `` little extramarital hobbies'' since he was first elected to the state Assembly in 1968. `` This kind of crap kind of discourages people from putting their names on the line,'' said <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, adding that there is no truth to the rumors of infidelity and he would consider legal action after the election. <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON> insisted his campaign staff had nothing to do with the comment, and any staffer would be fired immediately if involved. <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON> also has complained about recent news accounts citing his verbal miscues, including a reference to a nuclear repository that unintentionally came out as `` nuclear suppository.'' He also noted the opposition's references to <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON>'s recent ranking by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> administrative assistants as the least effective member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> businessman, upset Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON> in 1982 after the incumbent was bloodied during a tough primary fight. Cannon had to fight mob shadows after he was named in the indictment of then <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and mob figure <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorfman </PERSON>. He testified at length in their trial just a month before the election. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> campaign chief <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON> describes the <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON> campaign as `` Watergate-style politics the likes of which this state has never seen,'' and blames <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON> campaign chief <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Rietz </PERSON> for the `` dirty tricks.'' <PERSON> Rietz </PERSON> responds that Singer's attack `` is a little bit like the pot calling the kettle black,'' adding that the <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> camp criticized him for political low blows `` and now they're distributing information on me. Singer circulated a stack of news clips linking <PERSON> Rietz </PERSON> to political espionage during the Watergate era and quoting then-Republican National Chairman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, now the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nominee, as saying in 1973 he wanted none of the people involved in the activity ever working on <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> campaigns again. <PERSON> Rietz </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was n't referring to him but rather was talking about those convicted in the Watergate scandal. `` That did n't include me I was not charged with anything during Watergate,'' he said. `` I've been working in Republican campaigns ever since then.'' Singer said the <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON> campaign has shown `` a series of dirty tricks'' that began with a <PERSON> Rietz </PERSON> employee or ex-employee trying to dig up information on Democratic Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, who would take over <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>'s job as governor should <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> defeat <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON>. Singer said that was followed by claims by Ivy that <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> had engaged in extramarital affairs, misstatements and misleading advertisements, and what appeared to be a planted story about Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s ties to a casino executive convicted of skimming. `` There are dirty fingerprints everywhere,'' said Singer. `` <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>'s gaming industry has a black book -LRB- of unsavory types excluded from clubs -RRB- and if <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> politics had a black book Senator <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON>'s campaign would be in it.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s press secretary says the campaign is not interested in anything that would `` garble our message,'' and that includes cluttering it up with questions from the news media. So the Republican presidential campaign is wending its way toward the November election with an eye toward maximizing canned events that look good on television and minimizing contact with reporters who might ask questions that are not on the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> agenda. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Democratic rival, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, has tried to take a page from the same strategy playbook but so far with less success as his TV shots often find his back to the cameras. Even his recent celebrated tank ride, aimed at projecting himself as strong on defense and widely photographed, turned out to be a flop at convincing viewers, a poll showed. Still, both candidates are engaged in an election game plan that keeps reporters at a distance so as not to detract from their state-of-the-art visual events that they wrap around their campaign message of the day. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> press secretary <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> said the idea is that the campaign is trying to communicate with voters and, `` We're not going to purposely garble our message by everyday discussing'' what reporters put forth as an `` agenda as opposed to our own.'' Thus when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> recently went to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> to appeal to Hispanic and blue-collar voters, the traveling press was ushered into the <ORGANIZATION> Goya </ORGANIZATION> food plant to watch him sample Hispanic foods. Although the reporters were stationed only a few feet from him, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> waved off their questions because he was engaged in `` food tasting'' at the moment. `` We got ta get the message out,'' he said. The orchestrated days with little opportunity to question or challenge the candidates on topical issues has engendered frustration among the press corps whose job it is to cover the campaigns. Some TV and print journalists have begun including regular statements in their <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stories such as, `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as usual refused to respond to any questions.'' The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign generally is keeping the candidate so far from reporters that `` We're even out of shouting distance now,'' said <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> reporter <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>. Reporter <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Knight-Ridder </ORGANIZATION> has taken to wearing a monocular _ a field glass with a single eyepiece _ so that she can observe <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> from her far-away press perch. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> remains more accessible than <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, but the access is generally at late-night airport arrivals when most media deadlines are already past. Both candidates occasionally chat on the record with reporters flying with them. But most reporters agree that these casual sessions do not lend themselves to the more probing question-and-answer typical of a more formal news conference, and the candidates tend to close it off when the questions take on that tone. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has an average of one or two news conferences a week, considerably less than before a campaign survey found his TV coverage was centering not on his tailor-made message but on his responses to reporters' questions about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s latest allegations. Since <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was nominated in mid-August, his scheduled question-and-answer sessions with reporters have dwindled to an average of one a week, and chances to shout questions at airports and rope lines are significantly fewer. Campaign officials do n't deny the hold-the-press-at-bay strategy. `` In these last weeks of the campaign we have to have a clear message,'' said <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>. `` It is important to us that we set the agenda. We have a need to be responsive to the press. We also have a need to run a successful campaign. The only way to do that is to get your message out and your agenda.'' Senior <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON> recently complained that the TV networks were n't covering <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' speeches, and said the campaign would alter its media strategy to get on the networks. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s advance team diligently escorts camera crews around factories and behind podiums for the best shots of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee. The results are picture-perfect TV, a series of events where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has stood amid waving <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flags, has spoken against the backdrop of majestic columns on Capitol steps and been flanked by colorful school bands, cheerleaders and choirs. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> visuals are improving since the media adviser <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> began traveling with the candidate two weeks ago. But the Democrat has had a string of events where cameras saw only the back of his head or where the lighting obliterated what should have been a good shot. That was the case when he went to Yellowstone National Park to stand before a blackened forest. The singed background was so dark it was impossible to tell what it was. Another time <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> lined up a group of teen-agers on a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> beach to talk to them about the environment. The students faced the cameras, while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was positioned on the sand in front of them _ his back to the cameras.

<HEAD>Report Says Former Politburo Member Cheated to Skip Military
Service</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Former Politburo member <PERSON> Geidar </PERSON> <PERSON> Aliev </PERSON> ducked military service in World War II and later covered up his scheme with phony records saying he was a veteran, a newspaper reported. A lengthy article in Wednesday's editions of the weekly <ORGANIZATION> Literaturnaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION> accused <PERSON> Aliev </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> boss of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> and a close associate of the late Soviet leader <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, of rampant corruption. <PERSON> Aliev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s last appointment to the ruling Politburo before he died in 1982, worked for many years in the <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> KGB secret police. <PERSON> Aliev </PERSON>, 65, was dropped from the Politburo on Oct. 21, 1987, ostensibly for health reasons. But there were suggestions that he was tainted with corruption in his association with <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, now widely criticized for permitting corruption and stagnation. A <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> commission established years ago that when <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> attacked the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1941, the 18-year-old <PERSON> Aliev </PERSON> `` quit his studies in the industrial institute ... and to avoid being called into the army went to his motherland, his native town, <LOCATION> Nakhichevan </LOCATION>,'' said the article, which was written by lawyer <PERSON> Arkady </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaksberg </PERSON>. `` There he obtained a document stating that he allegedly suffered from a severe form of tuberculosis and was freed from service.'' He then began work in the archives of the <ORGANIZATION> NKVD </ORGANIZATION>, the precursor of the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Vaksberg </PERSON> said. After the war, <PERSON> Aliev </PERSON> obtained documents saying he was a war veteran, the article said. Despite the commission's discovery, <PERSON> Aliev </PERSON>'s older brother, Gasan, intervened. <PERSON> Aliev </PERSON> was reprimanded but remained in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and was able to build his career, the article said. <PERSON> Vaksberg </PERSON> said a former <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> officer and state prosecutor, <PERSON> Gambai </PERSON> <PERSON> Mamedov </PERSON>, repeatedly tried to draw the attention of Azerbaijani officials to widespread corruption and falsification of production statistics under <PERSON> Aliev </PERSON>. But the lawyer said <PERSON> Mamedov </PERSON> was hounded out of his job and the republic by officials, who lavished praise on <PERSON> Aliev </PERSON> in party and government meetings. He said that since <PERSON> Aliev </PERSON>'s ouster, <PERSON> Mamedov </PERSON> has been able to return to <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> capital, from <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> where he lived in the apartment of his wife's relatives.

 A naked man ran into St. Patrick's Cathedral on Wednesday night and attacked people with an iron prayer bookstand, killing one man and injuring a police officer before being shot to death by other officers, authorities said. That morning, the man attended Mass at the cathedral celebrated by Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> and stood directly before the cardinal as he administered the eucharist, <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> told reporters. The man entered the historic midtown church stark naked around 8 p.m. carrying red carnations, repeatedly hit a woman praying in a pew, walked to a front altar where he ripped the prayer book stanchion from the floor, and then struck and killed an usher and wounded a police officer with it, police and witnesses said. The man was shot and killed by a backup police unit after he used the three-foot-long stanchion to attack a police officer who tried to subdue him, said Sgt. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON>, a police spokesman. Lt. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrasso </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said the officer, <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> McManus </PERSON>, was taken to <LOCATION> Bellevue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> with head and shoulder injuries. He was listed in serious condition. The usher, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Winters </PERSON>, died about 50 feet from the altar. The woman's injuries were not immediately known. `` She gets up. I do n't think she was that hurt. She runs out of the church,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, an eyewitness. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said at an evening news conference that the naked man had stood before him during communion at the morning Mass. `` The man came up and stood in front of me,'' he said. `` I felt he was totally disoriented. The cathedral is a magnet for all people. People sleep in it and engage in the strangest behavior in the cathedral. I patted him on the shoulder and said, ` God bless you.' He stood for a moment and left.'' The cardinal said that the man allegedly had committed acts of minor vandalism in and around the church in the past. Described by <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> as `` big'' and `` powerful'' the man was able to rip the metal stanchion out of the marble floor to which it was bolted. Witness <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, 56, said he saw the man tear off his shorts and white shirt on a street near the church. `` He suddenly stopped, stripped, and headed up the street. He was obviously disturbed,'' <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> said. `` He was not aware of anybody else.'' <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> said the man was `` chanting under his breath'' from the time he took off his clothes, which were found at 50th Street and Rockefeller Plaza. A parishioner, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Strassburg </PERSON>, identified the dead church employee as an usher who was about 75 years old. The officer was taken to <LOCATION> Bellevue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> with head and shoulder injuries, and was listed in serious condition, <PERSON> Barrasso </PERSON> said. The attacker was shot once in the chest and pronounced dead at the scene, police said. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, 18, of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, said the man was already in the middle of the church and approaching the woman when he and his mother arrived to light some candles for loved ones. `` He had a belt in his hand and was hitting her in the back and all over. He was crazy hitting her with the belt. He must have hit her more than 10 times.'' <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said. `` Everyone backed away. Then the cops rushed in. She was screaming very loud that she was getting hit and needed help. But everyone was running away from her. We ran,'' <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said. `` She was screaming like she was in terrible pain,'' he said. The man was lying in the middle aisle of the church after he was shot, said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, who witnessed the incident. `` The police officer was trying to convince him to leave'' when the man attacked him with a metal stand, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Access Roads: A New Battle at Gettysburg</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It's the battle of Devil's Den, pitting tourist convenience against the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s desire to curtail traffic through the <LOCATION> Gettysburg </LOCATION> battlefield. The park service has proposed eliminating two access roads, as well as part of a third, to the historic Devil's Den area of the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> battlefield. The idea is to move the battlefield closer to its original appearance and to halt an erosion problem at Devil's Den, an area of huge rocks that is a popular tourist spot, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON> said Wednesday. The debate moved here last week when Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodling </PERSON>, R-Pa., presented to park service Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> <PERSON> Mott </PERSON> a petition containing signatures of more than 11,000 people who oppose the plan <PERSON> Mott </PERSON> has agreed to personally inspect the site as part of a review of the plan, according to park service spokesman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Berklacy </PERSON>. `` There was a road constructed in about 1904 during a period when people were visiting on horses and buggies,'' <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON> said. `` Since then, the response to more and larger vehicles has been more pavement, and we just feel that the time has come to take a new direction.'' But the Devil's <ORGANIZATION> Den </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Access </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> brought maps and a slide show last week to document their concerns to the park service that the plan would be counterproductive. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, a battlefield guide who heads the citizen protest, said Wednesday that he fears people would have to walk to Devil's Den from a planned new parking lot that may be too small to accommodate visitors The walk is three-quarters of a mile, round trip. `` People are not all joggers or athletic. Plus, there is inclement weather, and hot days,'' he said. Traffic, he said, will be diverted to other roads that will become more congested. An access road would be made available so that the disabled could be driven to the site, the park service said. The <ORGANIZATION> Gettysburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Battlefield </ORGANIZATION> has been holding events to mark the 125th anniversary of the bloody Civil War battle on July 1-3, 1863. Some 50,000 Union and Confederate soldiers were killed or wounded on the battlefield, later the scene of <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s famous Gettysburg Address.

 A nervous airport security dog prompted extra precautions as Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> arrived Wednesday night for what could be the last full-dress U.S.-Soviet talks in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> landed without incident, however, and was taken to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Embassy </LOCATION> where he will stay during two days of meetings with Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and other senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, ending in a call on President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at the White House on Friday. The Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> jetliner carrying <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> was parked more distant than usual from terminal buildings and news media facilities at <ORGANIZATION> Andrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, outside <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, because a dog used to sniff and detect explosives became nervous, said a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official who spoke on condition of anonymity. But it proved to be just a precaution and no explosives were found, the official said. A motorcade carried Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON>, Assistant Secretary <PERSON> Rozanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridgway </PERSON> and other welcoming officials from the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and Soviet Embassy to planeside while camera crews assigned to photograph the arrival were left at their usual position at least 250 feet away. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, making no arrival statement, left the airport immediately. By <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> count, his negotiations with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> on arms control, human rights, U.S.-Soviet and regional issues will be their 28th meeting. They are expected to meet again at <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> next week and possibly in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> if there is a breakthrough on human rights and other issues before the current review session at <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, of the 1975 <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> accords on East-West security and cooperation. But Ms. <PERSON> Ridgway </PERSON> told reporters this week there is no possibility that the two sides will be able to resolve differences before the end of the year on their mutual goal of achieving 50 percent cuts in strategic ballistic missile warheads to enable <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to sign another arms treaty before the end of his presidency. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s schedule also includes a separate meeting with Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the Republican candidate to succeed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, arranged at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s request, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Democratic rival, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has not asked for a meeting with the Soviet minister, the official added.

Gilbert</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hurricane Gilbert, which wreaked havoc on resorts in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, has given an unexpected boost to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>'s tourist industry during a normally slow month, tourism officials say. Tourists, hearing of the devastation left in <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>'s wake, are rearranging travel plans, officials said Wednesday. At least one company that books trips to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> has employees working overtime to handle the demand. Pleasant Hawaiian Holidays, the leading seller of tour packages to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, is receiving 40 percent more phone calls than normal for this time of year, according to spokesman <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>. The company is headquartered in <LOCATION> Westlake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` I know that they have required overtime for reservationists, bringing people back from vacations early, adding as much as possible to the staff,'' to handle the increased <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> business, <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said. September is considered a slow period for <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> travel, <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Vericella </PERSON>, vice president for <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> travel at <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Related </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, agreed that <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> is boosting tourism figures in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. `` Certainly we have seen an increase at our reservations center in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> crippled resorts in <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, both considered major competitors for <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>'s tourist industry. The hurricane is believed to have killed more than 200 people as it swept through the Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and into the mainland last week.

In <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION>, an agricultural center in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joaquin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told a downtown rally `` the agriculture policy of this administration has been a disaster for the American farmer.'' He talked about how the nation's drug problems have worsened in the past eight years. He continued to blast the Republicans for the record budget deficits. And, he continued to hammer at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s selection of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as his running mate `` We believe that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> deserves a vice president to take on the toughest and most important job in the world if that was necessary. Do you think the junior senator from <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> is up to that job?'' `` No,'' yelled the crowd.

<TEXT>
 The Cabinet today temporarily passed the imperial mantle to Crown Prince <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> as <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> fretted over the failing health of Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, the world's longest reigning monarch. Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Household </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which runs palace affairs, set up booths today around the country and allowed people to sign their names in books for the emperor. Crowds have gathered in front of the Imperial Palace in central <LOCATION> Toyko </LOCATION> since <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> took to bed with intestinal hemorrhaging four days ago. Palace officials said today that he remained in serious but stable condition. `` I felt like my grandfather was dying,'' <PERSON> Aya </PERSON> <PERSON> Kitade </PERSON>, a 22-year-old college student, said Wednesday at the palace. She came from <LOCATION> Kyoto </LOCATION>, 230 miles away, after her grandparents asked her to visit and convey their greetings to the emperor. Across <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, Shinto shrines held services to pray for the emperor. Many older people still hold <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> in high regard, but younger Japanese typically give him little thought. A minority strongly opposes the imperial system, charging it represents the strongly centralized state control and militarism that characterized wartime <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> forced the emperor, who has occupied the throne since 1926, to publicly renounce his claim to divinity after World War II. He remains a symbol of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> without wielding any real power. Chief Cabinet Secretary <PERSON> Keizo </PERSON> <PERSON> Obuchi </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> met today and agreed to put 54-year-old <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> temporarily in charge of all imperial duties. `` Taking into consideration the emperor's illness and medical treatment, we have asked the crown prince to temporarily assume responsibilities,'' <PERSON> Obuchi </PERSON> said in a nationally televised press conference.

<TEXT>
 The son of fugitive <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Biggs </PERSON> has arrived in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to seek a royal pardon for his father, a member of the gang that pulled off the notorious Great Train Robbery of 1963. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Biggs </PERSON>, 14, said upon arriving Wednesday at Heathrow Airport that he plans to present Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> with a letter urging her to suspend the 30-year sentence imposed on his father for his part in the robbery. `` I want to see my father a free man,'' the young <PERSON> Biggs </PERSON> told reporters after his flight from <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, where his father has lived in exile since 1970. `` It is his right. He has lived for the past 25 years as an honest man. I have lived with him for the past 14 years and know he is not a thief anymore,'' <PERSON> Biggs </PERSON> said. A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Buckingham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palace </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition on anonymity, said it would be `` highly unlikely'' for the queen to meet the youth. The British monarch is on vacation in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. The senior <PERSON> Biggs </PERSON>, 59, took part in the $ 7-million robbery from the Glasgow-to-London mail train Aug. 8, 1963. At the time, it was <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s largest heist. Less than $ 980,000 was recovered, but most of the 15 gang members, including <PERSON> Biggs </PERSON>, were caught and sentenced to prison. <PERSON> Biggs </PERSON> escaped from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Wandsworth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jail </ORGANIZATION> in July 1965 and fled to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, where he had plastic surgery on his face, then to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and finally in 1970 to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, which has no extradition treaty with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. In 1985, <PERSON> Biggs </PERSON> said his reported $ 325,000 share of the robbery was long gone. He said in an interview this year that he supports himself by selling souvenirs.

 Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is shrugging off a rebuke from <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> about the tenor of the flag-draped <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign, saying, `` We're talking about the issues.'' The Republican vice presidential nominee was delivering a foreign policy address today at the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> before heading home to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON>, who retired this year after a long <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> career as `` Mr. Conservative,'' stole the show from the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator Wednesday in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> when he delivered his surprise dart at a <ORGANIZATION> Rotary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> luncheon. After introducing <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> reclaimed the microphone. `` I forgot something that I had to say, and I hope you take this kindly. But I want you to go back and tell <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to start talking about the issues, O.K.?'' the 1964 Republican presidential candidate said. <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> did not elaborate, but the dig seemed aimed at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s capture-the-flag campaigning, from his constant criticism of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for vetoing a 1977 bill to penalize teachers who refuse to lead the Pledge of Allegiance to his stop Tuesday at a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> flag factory <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> brushed aside reporters' questions afterwards, saying, `` I'm not talking. I want to get the hell outof here.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, before the 400 Rotarians, laughed and said only, `` I wish <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> would just say what's on his mind.'' Later, he told reporters in <LOCATION> Bakersfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, `` <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> is my dear friend. We're talking about the issues.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> almost crossed paths with his Democratic counterpart, Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, at the airport in <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, where their campaign planes were parked 400 yards apart for a while. They did not meet. The final day of summer was an unusual one for the 41-year-old <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who trekked from <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joaquin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> before reuniting with his wife <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>, for a fund-raiser at a posh <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> hotel. A dozen feminists were waiting there with signs protesting <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s opposition to abortion. He was hounded in two stops in the <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> area by <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans, three of them clad in colorful chicken costumes. He made a detour to pick up <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> at his home, only to get admonished. <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s ousted Republican Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> showed up to deliver an unsolicited endorsement of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. At <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> State University-Fresno, he was greeted by sky-divers, balloons and a phalanx of students chanting `` Bush-Noriega'88!'' But inside a student union, he got an enthusiastic reception from 600 students as he denounced <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for opposing the death penalty and signing a proclamation in February 1985 supporting a union boycott of table grapes. In both <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION> and at a rally before 1,000 people outside the courthouse in <LOCATION> Bakersfield </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> lit into <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as `` a card-carrying member of the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>'' and charged he would appoint judges like <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Bird </PERSON>, the liberal <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> who was recalled in part for opposing the death penalty. At <ORGANIZATION> Frye </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chandler </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, he offered children a brief civics lesson on free speech after demonstrators yelled `` Chicken hawk'' at him. `` Do n't pay any attention to them. You know, in this country of ours, we have a thing called freedom of speech. ... `` he said. `` They have the freedom of speech, but you know what, kids? So do we.''

<HEAD>Investor Group Attempts Public Stock Offering to Buy Historic
Brothel</HEAD>

<DATELINE>RENO, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In an unusual meeting of the financial district and the red light district, an investor group plans a stock offering to raise money to buy the <ORGANIZATION> Mustang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ranch </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's biggest legal bordello. The group, led by <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> and real estate developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Clough </PERSON>, plans to raise $ 23.3 million through a stock offering to purchase the famed brothel 10 miles east of here, <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> said. The group filed an application Friday with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to sell 1.165 million common shares of <ORGANIZATION> Mustang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ranch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> at $ 20 a share, <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> said Wednesday. This is the second attempted share offering to raise money to buy the Mustang Ranch. A proposed $ 18 million sale by another group fell through in 1985 when it failed to attract enough investor interest. `` We've got everything in motion now and are just waiting to see what the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> does,'' said <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>, chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> Mustang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ranch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, formed last year to make the transaction. <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>, citing <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> rules, declined to discuss details of the deal or name the other two officers besides <PERSON> Clough </PERSON> who will control more than 40 percent of the company. Documents filed with the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> indicate $ 18 million would be used to buy the 105-room brothel. The remaining funds would cover capital improvements, financial reserves and administrative costs. The ranch's founder and owner, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Conforte </PERSON>, announced in July his plan to retire from the business after roughly 30 years. He needs the proceeds from the sale to pay back income taxes and penalties. `` I'm 62 years old,'' said <PERSON> Conforte </PERSON>, who was brought to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION> in 1937 by his produce-salesman father. `` I only have a few years left to live the good life and I want to enjoy them.'' <ORGANIZATION> Mustang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ranch </ORGANIZATION>'s gross revenue fell last year to $ 5.6 million from $ 5.9 million in 1986, but profits rose to $ 917,000 from $ 848,000, according to the prospectus. The prostitutes work as independent contractors, paying the ranch $ 10 a day for meals and facilities and splitting the gross receipts 50-50 with the house. The prospectus noted that the stock offering was a high-risk venture because of potential lawsuits, adverse publicity and the possibility that clients could get acquired immune deficiency syndrome. <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> law requires prostitutes to be tested monthly for AIDS, and so far no working women have tested positive for the AIDS virus. The brothels also require customers to use condoms to protect against disease. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> planned to file a response to the investor group's application within 20 days listing any deficiencies If the stock offering is allowed, it would the first time a bordello has become a publicly-held corporation. <PERSON> Conforte </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> began operations at the 440-acre ranch in the late 1950s, when <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> merely tolerated prostitution. In 1971, <ORGANIZATION> Conforte </ORGANIZATION> won <LOCATION> Storey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s approval for the brothel, pioneering the statewide movement to allow prostitution in most counties. The state now has about three dozen licensed brothels, although none is as large as the Mustang. The couple has been trying to sell the ranch since early 1985, when <PERSON> Conforte </PERSON> finished serving 18 months in prison on charges involving $ 2 million in unpaid income taxes. He also served time for an income tax conviction in the 1960s. At least $ 12 million in proceeds from the sale would go to pay back the taxes, plus interest and penalties, <PERSON> Conforte </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Redesigned Natural Poison Offers Possible AIDS Treatment</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A modified version of a natural poison kills AIDS-infected cells in the test tube while ignoring normal cells, offering a possible strategy to help treat AIDS, scientists reported today. The specialized toxin may be able to kill infected cells in people before the cells produce more viruses, said researcher <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Moss </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Moss </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Pastan </PERSON> and five other <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> scientists describe experimental results in today's issue of the British journal Nature. In a second development, scientists at <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> and in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> say they have produced stable AIDS virus infections in rabbits, a step that may help animal testing of AIDS vaccines and drugs. Until now, such infections have been shown only in chimpanzees, which are costly and in limited supply. The poison research involved <PERSON> Pseudomonas </PERSON> exotoxin A, which is produced by bacteria called <PERSON> Pseudomonas </PERSON> aeruginosa. It is so strong that a dose about the size of a salt grain can kill a human. `` We're encouraged both by the low amount of drug which is effective'' and its ability to ignore uninfected cells in test-tube experiments, said <PERSON> Moss </PERSON>. To make the poison seek out AIDS-infected cells, researchers essentially replaced the part of the poison molecule that normally guides the toxin to its target. In its place they put part of a protein called CD4, which latches onto a protein found on the surface of AIDS-infected cells. The redesigned poison was produced by combining genes for the poison and the CD4, and placing them into bacteria called E. coli. The bacteria, commonly used as a vehicle for gene splicing, then churned out the hybrid poison. In test-tube experiments with white blood cells, the redesigned poison killed infected cells while leaving uninfected ones unharmed. <PERSON> Moss </PERSON> said scientists still have to determine whether the poison would reach all infected cells in the body, and whether it would overlook infected cells in which the virus was lying dormant rather than reproducing. While the toxin would not kill the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome, previous research suggests it might prevent the virus from infecting new cells, <PERSON> Moss </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> called the poison research a scientific advance but said any medical usefulness will take a long time to demonstrate. `` There is a long jump from the test tube to the patient,'' he said. Also in today's issue of Nature, Italian scientists report AIDS infections lasting a year in six rabbits. And in an interview this week, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kindt </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> said about 20 rabbits in his laboratory have remained infected for up to about 10 months. <PERSON> Oliviero </PERSON> <PERSON> Varnier </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Microbiology </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Genoa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, said in a telephone interview that four rabbits have now stayed infected for 18 months. The other two died a month ago of unknown causes, he said. His group injected the rabbits in the abdominal area with either infected cells or free-floating virus. A few days before the injection, the animals had been treated to produce white blood cells in the abdominal area that would be `` ready to engulf anything that you give to them,'' <PERSON> Varnier </PERSON> said. But no significant outward symptoms from the infections were observed, <PERSON> Varnier </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kindt </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kindt </PERSON>'s experiments produced AIDS virus infection by injecting infected human blood cells. <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> researcher <PERSON> Dani </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolognesi </PERSON> said rabbit infections may prove useful for vaccine and drug testing if they can be produced routinely, and if they are found to mimic natural virus infection closely enough.

He said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> made the comments out of `` ambition and a partisan fight to reach the White House. ... In his internal politicking, lacking ethics and morals, -LRB- <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> -RRB- is capable of sacrificing the security of people.'' <PERSON> Bolanos </PERSON> made his remarks from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberacion </ORGANIZATION>, the Nicaraguan rebels' clandestine radio station. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said Tuesday that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had received `` clear testimony'' that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration sought to secretly undermine the Nicaraguan peace process, thus damaging long-term prospects for an accord between the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> and U.S.-supported Contra rebels. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Wednesday accused <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> of talking indiscreetly about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence secrets, but stopped short of denying the claim. The Sandinista government had no immediate response, but the official newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Barricada </ORGANIZATION> ran a banner headline Wednesday saying, `` <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Confesses To Plan <PERSON> Melton </PERSON>.'' In July, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> expelled <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Melton </PERSON>, saying he was carrying out an adminstration plan to undermine <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s government by supporting opposition groups. The Sandinistas expelled him and seven other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats the day after a July 10 rally they said was part of that plan. Police arrested more than 40 opposition leaders at the big anti-government march in the southern city of <LOCATION> Nandaime </LOCATION> after clashing with protesters. The Contras said earlier this week that further talks to forge a lasting peace to replace a March 23 preliminary cease-fire pact can not be held until the 40 are freed. The day after the Nandaime rally, the government suspended for 15 days the only opposition newspaper, <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION>, and closed the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> radio station for 38 days. President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said this week that the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government organization, provides more than $ 600,000 for several opposition groups, including <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION>.

 The government has suspended 33 wildlife officers suspected of collaborating with poachers who have slaughtered scores of elephants, said a senior <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tourism </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> official. <PERSON> Josiah </PERSON> <PERSON> Sang </PERSON>, permanent secretary in the ministry, said in a statement Wednesday that the action was take to rid the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> of `` dishonest and unreliable officers who have been found not only unproductive but also collaborating with poachers.'' The department has acknowledged that poachers have killed 92 elephants in <LOCATION> Tsavo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> during the past four months. Five game wardens and policemen have been killed and at least nine wounded in clashes with poachers during the past month, officials said. In the most recent clash, on Friday, police officers exchanged gunfire with about 50 suspected poachers in <LOCATION> Tsavo </LOCATION>. Newspapers said a policeman and a ranch foreman were killed and nine policemen wounded. The Daily Nation, a <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION> newspaper, said police rounded up more than 200 people for questioning over the weekend. Police also searched vehicles passing through or near the park for game trophies. There were no reports of arrests. It is illegal in <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> to possess wild game trophies without a permit and hunting is not allowed. President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> arap </PERSON> <PERSON> Moi </PERSON> ordered rangers on Sept. 13 to shoot on sight poachers caught in the country's national parks and game reserves. He gave the order after the government suspended mining and prospecting in the country's 53 game and national parks, a move aimed at denying poachers any cover. Studies by the Nairobi-based <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Environmental Program show that in the past 15 years, <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s elephant population has dropped 85 percent. An aerial survey in February of the vast Tasvo park in southeastern <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> found 5,363 elephants, down from an estimated 35,000 in 1974.

 Heavyweight champion <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> says he was born with manic depression and `` maybe that's why I'm successful at what I do,'' but he realizes he has a problem he has to confront, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported. The interview, published in the newspaper today, occurred just hours after <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> hurled a radio at a television crew he confronted while doing his morning run outside his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> mansion on Wednesday. Following that incident, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said, <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> had a tearful talk with his wife, actress <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Givens </PERSON>, his mother-in-law, <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Roper </PERSON>, and psychiatrist <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurtis </PERSON> at which <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> admitted being out of control at times. `` I was born with this disease,'' the champion is quoted as saying. `` I ca n't help it. Maybe that's why I'm successful at what I do. I ca n't help it. This is the way I was all my life.'' <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>, 22, has had a series of violent incidents in the last year.

According to the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> has changed his mind. `` I'm doing my best, talking to Dr. <PERSON> McCurtis </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is the beginning.'' <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> said he was relieved to find out he suffered from a problem confronted by millions of Americans. `` It's not scary, it's just that I'm very abnormally high-strung,'' <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> said in the interview. <PERSON> Givens </PERSON> said it was a step in the right direction. `` If he's willing to make a commitment ... after an awful, awful treacherous, scary morning, he made a commitment to try,'' she said. `` He's been like this for years and they've been ignoring it. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> takes a great deal of protecting. ... You ca n't put a Band-aid on it. Who cares if he fights again. This guy's got to live the rest of his life.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said that <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>'s statements came after a stormy trip to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> had several violent episodes in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, including chasing <PERSON> Givens </PERSON>, <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> and a secretary through their hotel, the newspaper said, citing sources it did not identify. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said that before the trip to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> <PERSON> McCurtis </PERSON> had diagnosed <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> as manic-depressive, a condition characterized by alternating periods of mania and mental depression. <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Givens </PERSON> returned Tuesday night. <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> went for a run Wednesday morning near his <LOCATION> Bernardsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, home and found a film crew from <ORGANIZATION> WNBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> waiting for him. When <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> saw the crew, he hurled his portable radio at the camera and then moved toward the crew. The incident later appeared on the air.

<TEXT>
 The dollar inched up against the Japanese yen at the close of trading Thursday, while share prices lost ground on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The dollar opened at 134.35 yen and moved in a narrow range of 134.27-124 .55 yen in light trading It closed at 134.47 yen, up 0.29 yen from the previous day's close of 134.16 yen. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, the main index on the stock exchange, declined 284.35 points, or 1.03 percent, from Wednesday's close to finish the day's trade at 27,428.31. Exchange dealers said trading was slow as players were sidelined ahead of a long holiday weekend in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Markets will be closed Friday for a national holiday, Autumn Equinox Day. Also an upcoming meeting of the group of seven, consisting of finance ministers and central bank heads from seven industrial nations, was scheduled over the weekend, prompting many market participants to sit out and watch the situation Thursday, dealers said. `` The basic trend is to buy the dollar, but it's not an active one,'' said an exchange dealer with <ORGANIZATION> Sumitomo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. `` The slight gain in the dollar today was a result of its rise in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> -LRB- overnight -RRB-,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Securities dealers said share prices opened on bullishly, but most institutional investors concentrated their purchases to large-capital steel shares, leading to declines in other issues. `` Steel shares absorbed the market's energy,'' said a trader at a Japanese securities firm, who asked not to be identified. One trader said buying interest was down due to continued unconcertainty over the emperor's condition. Palace physicians say the 87-year-old monarch is in stable but serious condition four days after falling ill due to intestinal hemorrhaging.

<HEAD>Soldiers and Civilians Vent Rage in Haitian Revolt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ More soldiers turned on their commanders and civilian mobs slaughtered the henchmen of three decades of Haitian dictators in the spreading chaos of a popular soldiers' revolt. In an isolated case of loyalty to a commander, troops in the northern port city of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marc </LOCATION> killed a 12-year-old boy ednesday when they fired into a mob about to attack the home of a sergeant with a reputation for brutality, witnesses said. Rank-and-file soldiers in at least 16 military units throughout the country have revolted against their commanders since ousting and exiling Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> in a weekend coup and naming Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Prosper </PERSON> <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> president. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> tried unsuccessfully to quell the uprising on Tuesday by naming a new armed forces chief and retiring nine unpopular commanding officers. `` The situation is precarious. After all, we are in the midst of a general mutiny,'' one Western diplomat said Wednesday, speaking on condition of anonymity. In the capital of <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION>, a leftist coalition called for a popular show of support today for the mutineers. The Confederation of <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION> urged people to meet outside the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bosco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, where 13 worshipers were killed and 77 wounded by thugs attacking with guns, pikes and machetes during a Mass six days before the coup. The demonstration was previously scheduled for Wednesday and confederation leaders had suspended it, saying they would meet instead with the leader of the military rebellion, Sgt. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Heubreux </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>. There was no confirmation the meeting was held. A mob on Wednesday placed the smoldering body of a Tonton Macoute killed the previous day at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bosco </ORGANIZATION>'s, where several hundred people gathered. The Macoutes were the private army of the regime created by <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> that ruled this impoverished nation for 29 years until mass protests forced his son, <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON>, into exile in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in February 1986. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> then headed a junta that promised a transition to democracy. However, independently run general elections Nov. 29 were thwarted when armed thugs supported by soldiers killed at least 33 people at polling stations. <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON>, a civilian, was elected president in January in military-run balloting that was boycotted by leading presidential candidates amd marred by widespread irregularities. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> ousted him in June. Radio stations estimated Wednesday that up to 12 Tonton Macoutes had been killed by mobs and soldiers since Sunday. Rebellious soldiers rounded up agents of <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wednesday </ORGANIZATION> and dumped them _ some in handcuffs _ at army headquarters in <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION>. About 200 people gathered and cheered each jeepload of soldiers with their captives. The fate of the ousted military commanders dropped off there was unknown. At least 11 commanders have been ousted since Monday. They include former Defense Minister Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> <PERSON> Regala </PERSON>, despised in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> for his ties to the <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> dictatorship. When they began their mutiny, the enlisted men led by <PERSON> Heubreux </PERSON> and other members of the Presidential Guard presented the army high command with a list of demands that included calls for <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s first free elections in 31 years and for major changes in the military When the high command hesitated, soldiers took matters in their own hands, ousting their commanders all over the <LOCATION> Carribean </LOCATION> country of about 5 million people. `` The demands of the mutineers have been accepted; it has become a people's army, at least for the moment,'' said a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Only pockets of soldiers have openly resisted. In <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marc </LOCATION>, some 60 miles north of the capital, troops loyal to Capt. <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> <PERSON> Ravix </PERSON>, accused by townspeople of corruption and brutality, put down popular demonstrations Wednesday, killing the 12-year-old, <PERSON> Nilo </PERSON> <PERSON> Chailes </PERSON>, and wounding three people, witnesses said. The soldiers later went to a local jail, freed several prisoners, and marched triumphantly through the city of 15,000 to popular acclaim. But the crowd was not fully placated and later shouted at Ravix: `` Macoute, Macoute!'' <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inter </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday that mutineers battled other troops, with one soldier dead in a clash Tuesday in <LOCATION> Jacmel </LOCATION>, about 45 miles south of <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION>. On Tuesday, workers at government companies struck to unseat state-appointed managers in other action apparently aimed at wiping out remnants of <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>'s rule.

<HEAD>Dollar Up, Stocks Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar gained marginally on the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> foreign exchange market today while share prices declined sharply on the <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. After opening at 134.35 yen, the dollar moved in a narrow range of 134.27-134 .55 yen in light trading It closed at 134.47 yen, up 0.29 yen from the previous day's close. Exchange dealers said the slight gain reflected strong showing of the currency in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> overnight, but the lack of fresh incentives prevented the dollar from strengthening further. `` The dollar is in a difficult position to move too far because of the upcoming Group of Seven meeting,'' said an exchange dealer in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` But market participants are expecting no major changes in the meeting, either.'' The meeting of the Group of Seven, in which foreign ministers and central bank chiefs from the seven major industrialized nations discuss international economic and fiscal policies, is scheduled on Saturday in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Kiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> said he expects the current international cooperation in fiscal policies will be maintained after that meeting. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, the main index on the stock exchange, declined 284.35 points, or 1.03 percent, from Wednesday's close to finish the day's trading at 27,428.31. Securities dealers attributed the drop of share prices to profit taking. `` After the news of the Emperor's ailing health shook <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> Monday night, the general direction of the market has been negative,'' said a dealer at a major securities firm. `` So everyone is trying to take advantage of yesterday's gain.'' Despite the downward trend, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> index gained 164.08 points Wedneday. Most securities dealers expect the market will remain directionless and unpredictable until Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s condition becomes clearer. `` The market as a whole appears to be regaining energy after more than a month long slump,'' said another dealer at a major securities firm, requesting anonymity. `` The increased volume and the popularity of large-capital shares are one of the signs of that.'' The volume traded on the first section of the exchange, where most major shares are listed, was 850 million shares. Both the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> foreign exchange markets will be closed Friday because of a national holiday. The stock exchange will have a half day session Saturday while foreign exchange dealing will remain closed until Monday.

 Thirty-eight people were hurt across <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in five bombings over nine hours, according to police, who said the first blast injured 18 whites, while the next-to-last hurt 19 blacks. A 1 a.m. blast today inside the Why Not disco in the <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Hillbrow </LOCATION> injured 19 blacks, three seriously, and caused extensive damage, police said. The disco is frequented almost exclusively by blacks. During the Wednesday evening rush hour, a bomb exploded at the main white bus terminal in downtown <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, injuring 19 people, all but one of them white, police said. The explosion occurred just after 5 p.m. in one of the new concrete trash bins installed throughout the city last year to muffle the effects of bombs. It shattered windows of four buses, damaged a fast-food cafe, and broke the windows of buildings and cars in the area. Meanwhile, police said early today that bombs exploded overnight in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> and in the southern towns of King <PERSON> William </PERSON>'s Town and <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beaufort </LOCATION>. There were no injuries in the three attacks, police said. In <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, a bomb placed at the front door extensively damaged the home of <ORGANIZATION> Shakes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> el </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Goolam </ORGANIZATION>, an <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> candidate in the municipal elections next month, police said. The explosion occurred at 1:25 a.m. In <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beaufort </LOCATION>, an explosive device damaged the back of a public library and in King <PERSON> William </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Town </ORGANIZATION>, a suspected mini-limpet mine exploded in the front of the magistrate's court building. No one claimed responsibility for any of the attacks. Minister of Law and <PERSON> Order </PERSON> <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> described the blast at the bus terminal as a `` repulsive act'' carried out by `` cowards.'' There have been more than 110 bombings in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> since the government declared a nationwide state of emergency in June 1986. Police have blamed virtually all the attacks on the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the main black group attempting to overthrow the white minority government. However, in recent weeks bombs have exploded at the headquarters of anti-apartheid groups and at public facilities frequented mostly by blacks.

Passengers evacuated Flight 135 on an emergency slide Wednesday, according to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hotard </PERSON>, a spokesman for the airline. <PERSON> Hotard </PERSON> said there was no fire and only one person was hurt, suffering a minor ankle injury.

<HEAD>Court Orders Work Permits, Bars Deportation of Aliens</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court has barred the deportation of up to 100,000 aliens until it decides whether the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> was too restrictive in denying them amnesty. In a decision made public Wednesday, the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> also authorized temporary work permits for the aliens. The court ordered the temporary measures until it rules on whether the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> exceeded its authority by denying amnesty to aliens who had left the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> briefly. Depending on its ruling, the court could reopen the now-expired deadline for aliens to apply for amnesty under the new immigration law. The court said it would hear arguments in the case in November under an accelerated schedule. The government is appealing a federal judge's ruling in April that the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> interpreted the grounds for amnesty too narrowly. `` This is a great day for our system of justice,'' said <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Abascal </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Rural Legal Assistance lawyer in the case. He said four other federal judges around the nation have restricted <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> enforcement of related provisions of the amnesty law, but that this was the first order from an appellate court. The number of aliens potentially affected by the case is estimated to be from 50,000 to 100,000 nationwide, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyer <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> McIntosh </PERSON>, who represented the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>, declined comment. The new immigration law allowed aliens who have been in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> continuously since Jan. 1, 1982, to apply for amnesty by May, the first step toward legal residence. A trip outside the country that is `` brief, casual and innocent'' does not disqualify an alien from amnesty. Under an <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> interpretation, however, any departure after May 1, 1987, when amnesty applications began, that lacked advance approval from the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> could not be `` innocent'' and made the alien ineligible for amnesty. <PERSON> Abascal </PERSON> said in a statement that the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> had used its reading of the law to bar amnesty to several aliens who had made brief trips to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to see a dying relative, and to one who fell asleep in a car shortly before his friends went to <LOCATION> Tijuana </LOCATION> for a two-hour frolic. Chief U.S. District Judge <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Karlton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> ruled in April that the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> interpretation was not authorized by the law. After finding that numerous aliens had been denied amnesty improperly or had been discouraged from applying, he issued a nationwide order in June reopening the application period through Nov. 30, which the government appealed. The appeals court decision requires that the government question any aliens arrested under the immigration law to see if they would be eligible for amnesty if not for foreign travel of the kind covered by the suit. If so, the aliens must be released without bond and given work permits while the court case is pending. The same rights must be provided to aliens who approach the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> with questions about their status and are covered by the case. <PERSON> Abascal </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> also is required to contact aliens who have been denied amnesty because of brief trips out of the country and tell them their cases are being reopened.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, protected by a bulletproof vest and shield, appealed for help in his government's fight against Sikh terrorism on his first visit to the embattled <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> since 1985. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> placed the foundation stone for a new paper mill in this small village amid tight security on his one-day trip Wednesday to the northern state, where Sikh extremists are fighting for an independent homeland. The government hopes the $ 170 million mill will help pump new life into a state shattered by six years of guerrilla and terrorist attacks. Sikh radicals have killed more than 1,950 people in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> this year, nearly double the toll for 1987. The prime minister was accompanied by more than 6,000 paramilitary troops, mostly armed with steel-tipped bamboo sticks, and stood at the podium behind a bulletproof shield. `` The anti-nationals want to break democracy in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, but we must give our lives to maintain it,'' <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> said, wearing a bulletproof vest as he addressed the crowd of 15,000 factory workers, students and teachers. `` We have no fight with the Sikhs, only the terrorists.

 The signs today read `` 7 Days to Launch'' as <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> prepares for Discovery to lift off with five astronauts on a flight the space agency hopes will restore credibility to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s manned space program. The signs, at entrances to the Kennedy Space Center, greet the 13,000 workers here who have labored 32 months since the Challenger tragedy to return the shuttle to flight. Next Thursday, barring any problems, Discovery will be fuming on the launch pad, its flight crew ready to go. Spirits are high among shuttle workers. They began soaring after a successful launch pad test-firing of Discovery's engines Aug. 10 and an almost flawless countdown practice Sept. 8, the last two hurdles before launch. `` We clearly demonstrated we are ready to pick up the count for real,'' the space center director, <PERSON> Forrest </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON>, told cheering workers after the countdown test. But one possible threat to Discovery's launch was revealed Wednesday, when <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials said an old-model nozzle inlet ring was used in the final test of <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>'s redesigned space shuttle booster rocket. However, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> does n't believe the finding will delay next week's launch, spokesman <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Medal </PERSON> said Medal said it had not yet been determined conclusively if outdated rings were used in the two boosters attached to Discovery, but a preliminary investigation showed they had not. Kennedy Space Center has adopted the slogan `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Pride ... The Journey Continues'' for Discovery's mission. It is proclaimed on a banner at the launch pad entrance, in offices and on thousands of pins worn by employees ranging from engineers to secretaries. At the launch pad today, technicians were set to purge Discovery's fuel cells and external fuel tank with gases to remove possible contaminants, install batteries in the communications satellite in the cargo bay, and complete other last-minute preparations for the start of the countdown at 12:01 a.m. Monday. At <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, Discovery's crew was scheduled to discuss the mission in late afternoon during a visit with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Afterwards, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was to address center workers on the space program. Once the countdown is under way, the astronauts will fly here Monday afternoon to make final preparations for flight. Commanding the crew is <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON>. The pilot is <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Col. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> O </PERSON>. <PERSON> Covey </PERSON> and the mission specialists are Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilmers </PERSON>, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lounge </PERSON>. All are veteran shuttle fliers. During four days in orbit they are scheduled to deploy a communications satellite, conduct 11 science and technology experiments and check out more than 200 modifications made to the vehicle. Most of the changes are intended to make the shuttle safer and were instituted after the Challenger explosion that killed seven crew members on Jan. 28, 1986. The shuttle fleet has been grounded since the accident.

 A piece of the engine of a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> commuter airplane broke off, punctured one of the craft's windows and entered the passenger cabin, injuring as many as nine people, authorities said. A witness described a `` loud bang'' about 10 minutes before the four-engine DeHavilland-7 turboprop was dueto land Wednesday at <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> with 13 passengers and three crew members aboard. The pilot of Flight 878, which originated at <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said nothing to the passengers and the 50-seat craft appeared to land normally, said one passenger, A.K. <PERSON> Gupta </PERSON> said. There were conflicting reports of injuries early today. <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Saterlee </PERSON>, manager of passenger services for <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>, said there were seven people hurt. However, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Albany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> said nine people were admitted there. All but one of those injured were treated and released, said the spokesman, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Puff </PERSON>. The injuries consisted of smoke inhalation, cuts from glass fragments or, in one case, a minor burn, said Puff. The only passenger admitted was <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Roecker </PERSON>, 33, of <PERSON> Rexford </PERSON>. He suffered eye and facial injuries and was in fair condition, <PERSON> Puff </PERSON> said. His wife, <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON>, 40, was treated for a leg injury and smoke inhalation. <PERSON> Gupta </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> executive who said he was traveling from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, said the incident happened three rows behind his seat on the plane's right side. `` I was asleep.

<HEAD>Report Documents Rail Car Hazards</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's railroads routinely use freight and passenger cars with defective brakes, wheels and undercarriages despite warnings from safety inspectors, according to a newspaper report. Business pressures have created a tug-of-war between inspectors who order cars repaired in the shop and transportation employees who schedule trains, said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>, assistant general foreman of <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>'s coach yard at <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>'s 30th Street Station. `` I'm not going to tell you that there are n't cars getting out of here that should n't be moving. It happens,'' <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in an article published Wednesday. `` An inspector finds something wrong and wants to shop the car, but transportation needs that car for a train leaving in three hours, so the car goes out,'' he said. In addition to <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's only long-distance passenger rail line, problems were found with <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> freight trains, the Press said. However, the newspaper did not link any train derailments or other major service problems to the defects. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Geist </PERSON>, an engineer on <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>'s Broadway Limited on the <LOCATION> Pittsburgh-Harrisburg </LOCATION> leg of its <LOCATION> Chicago-New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> run, said he was ordered June 19 not to slow down despite repeatedly reporting that his speedometer did not work. `` I'm talking about taking a train loaded with 400 or 500 passengers up and down the steepest grades in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, where a difference of 5 or 10 mph will not only violate <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION>'s, <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>'s and the -LRB- federal -RRB- rules, but also endanger the passengers,'' <PERSON> Geist </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Claytor </PERSON> said his company runs `` safe operations,'' although conditions are not ideal. `` Business is so good we overutilize our equipment,'' he said. `` We have a whole lot of mechanical failures on the road, more than we should. We turn around equipment too fast, but we ca n't let it lay over 48 hours. If we do that, a lot of people are not going to be able to ride. `` But ... we are not going to cut corners on safety or on our basic maintenance policy,'' <PERSON> Claytor </PERSON> said. The Press said it learned that one <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> car was used between <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> from June 18 until July 5 even though inspectors had found a steel wheel marked by a heat crack that could have caused the wheel to shatter. The newspaper said three cars that derailed in the 30th Street Station yard June 29 were sent out unrepaired on a <LOCATION> Philadelphia-New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> run despite <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> policy requiring the replacement of any wheels that leave the track. `` There was a serious mistake made by releasing those three cars,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Burk </PERSON>, chief mechanical officer of the federally subsidized rail service. The Press said it documented similar problems a week later in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> on <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Zephyr bound for <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, the Empire Builder bound for <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> and the Capitol Limited bound for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>. At <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION>'s giant Enola yard at <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION>, the newspaper said it observed a man in a supervisor's white hardhat in mid-June remove nine tags that inspectors had attached to freight cars to indicate the need for major repairs All nine cars were returned to service despite the defects, which the newspaper said included a cracked undercarriage on a tanker. Similar activity was documented at <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> yards in <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Conway </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, the newspaper said. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Rugh </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utility </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> rail inspector, said: `` I get the <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> trains that come out of <PERSON> Conway </PERSON> when they get into <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>, and they are loaded with defects. I have found 25 or 30 on a single train, ranging the full gamut from bad air brakes to broken handholds.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasselman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for operations, responded that he believes inspections are being conducted properly because supervisors make spot checks regularly. <PERSON> Hasselman </PERSON> said cars are tagged sometimes for repairs that are n't needed and sometimes no defects are found on a tagged car The Press cited its own observations and inspectors' records in reporting that <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> freight cars with defects ranging from inoperable brakes to cracked couplers were allowed to roll from yards in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, Hazard, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, and other locations. However, <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crane </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION>, retorted: `` If we find any supervisor doing that, or allowing this to be done, well ... we have a saying on the railroad that we would almost make a milepost out of him.''

 Police have seized a van loaded with military gear and arrested two black men suspected of plotting to rescue two men alleged to be South African commandos, the <ORGANIZATION> Botswana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. The agency said Wednesday that police found a pistol, silencer, ammunition, two-way radio and wire-cutter in a van belonging to <PERSON> Johannes </PERSON> <PERSON> Zitha </PERSON>, 29, a South African.

On Monday, the Botswanan defense attorney for the two white South Africans was arrested in connection with the alleged escape plot. The news agency quoted police as saying the attorney, <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> <PERSON> Morotsi </PERSON>, was arrested while in possession of unspecified `` undesirable'' items. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Matlapeng </PERSON>, a divisional police commander, was quoted as saying that the wire-cutter may have been intended for use in trying to rescue the alleged commandos from <LOCATION> Francistown </LOCATION> Prison.

 A man on parole for manslaughter and held for harassment was freed on $ 500 bail and allowed to commit a double murder-suicide because a judge did not take steps to discover the man's violent past, a report said. The report by <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assignment </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Reginald </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanton </PERSON> also said failures by probation officers, prosecutors and family caseworkers contributed to the release of <PERSON> Nicolas </PERSON> <PERSON> Vutca </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Parsippany-Troy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>. No officials will be disciplined, however, because no one was guilty of `` repeated acts'' of violating proper procedures, <PERSON> Stanton </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Vutca </PERSON>, a Romanian national, killed his wife, <PERSON> Dorina </PERSON>, and her mother, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Vacariu </PERSON>, on Sept. 10 at their home in Effort, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, and then shot himself to death. `` Looking at the total situation, we see an incredible combination of things that went wrong,'' said <PERSON> Stanton </PERSON>'s report, which was released Tuesday and submitted to state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Chief Justice <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilentz </PERSON>. `` If any one of them had gone right, the tragic consequence might have been avoided.'' <PERSON> Vutca </PERSON> was convicted of aggravated manslaughter in 1983 in the stabbing death a year earlier of his live-in girlfriend. He was paroled in 1986 and married <PERSON> Dorina </PERSON> last year. <PERSON> Vutca </PERSON> was arrested Aug. 17 on charges of harassment and violating a court order to stay away from his wife. Mrs. <PERSON> Vutca </PERSON> and her mother then moved to <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> set bail at $ 25,000 the day of the arrest.

The report said `` many judges in Judge <PERSON> Bangiola </PERSON>'s position would have seen the $ 25,000 bail and suspected that the case must involve something more than verbal threats.'' It said <PERSON> Bangiola </PERSON> could have telephoned Ms. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> or taken other steps to find out more about <PERSON> Vutca </PERSON>'s background. <PERSON> Bangiola </PERSON> said through his secretary he would not comment on the report. <PERSON> Stanton </PERSON> said judges and court employees have been `` re-educated'' about proper procedures, and that workers and the prosecutor's office have been encouraged to inform him or other judges `` when they think something has gone wrong.''

 As Congregation <PERSON> Sharai </PERSON> <PERSON> Torah </PERSON> observed Yom Kippur at a nearby Jewish school, a 12-year-old boy apologized for setting fire to the congregation's building days earlier. Two youths were arrested on arson and other charges after they allegedly spray-painted swastikas on the walls of the Orthodox synagogue, set a fire and unrolled and burned six Torahs, the sacred handwritten scrolls that contain the first five books of the Old Testament. The crime, on the Sabbath before Yom Kippur, shocked <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>'s huge Jewish community An estimated 10,000 people turned out Sunday for a memorial service for the burned Torahs. `` We believe that everything, including this fire, is from God,'' said the president of the 300-member <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> congregation, <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>. The president of the <ORGANIZATION> Rabbinical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, Rabbi <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schreier </PERSON>, issued a statement Wednesday calling it an `` act of ruthless vandalism the likes of which have not been seen since the Holocaust.'' One of the accused youths, a 12-year-old boy identified only by his first name, <PERSON> Joey </PERSON>, said he was only out to have fun Saturday morning when he and a 15-year-old companion desecrated the synagogue. In an interview with <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newsday </ORGANIZATION> published Wednesday, <PERSON> Joey </PERSON> said he had n't known what a synagogue was and did not vandalize it out of anti-Semitism.

 A piece of the engine of a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> commuter airplane broke off, punctured one of the craft's windows and entered the passenger cabin, injuring as many as nine people, authorities said. A witness described a `` loud bang'' about 10 minutes before the four-engine DeHavilland-7 turboprop was dueto land Wednesday at <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> with 13 passengers and three crew members aboard. The pilot of Flight 878, which originated at <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said nothing to the passengers and the 50-seat craft appeared to land normally, said one passenger, A.K. <PERSON> Gupta </PERSON> said. There were conflicting reports of injuries early today. <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Saterlee </PERSON>, manager of passenger services for <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>, said there were seven people hurt. However, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Albany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> said nine people were admitted there. All but one of those injured were treated and released, said the spokesman, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Puff </PERSON>. The injuries consisted of smoke inhalation, cuts from glass fragments or, in one case, a minor burn, said Puff. The only passenger admitted was <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Roecker </PERSON>, 33, of <PERSON> Rexford </PERSON>. He suffered eye and facial injuries and was in fair condition, <PERSON> Puff </PERSON> said. His wife, <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON>, 40, was treated for a leg injury and smoke inhalation. <PERSON> Gupta </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> executive who said he was traveling from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, said the incident happened three rows behind his seat on the plane's right side. `` I was asleep.

<HEAD>Study Finds Fish Oil Promising Addition to Common Heart Procedure</HEAD>

 Fish oil provides the first effective way of keeping newly opened heart arteries working smoothly after angioplasty, a procedure used on 200,000 Americans annually with heart disease, according to a study published today. `` It looks very promising,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dehmer </PERSON>. `` It's the only agent so far that has even shown a hint of having an effect This study is a little like the light at the end of the tunnel.'' <PERSON> Dehmer </PERSON>, now a cardiologist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION>, was in charge of the fish oil experiment at the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. Angioplasty is widely used because it provides a non-surgical alternative to coronary bypass operations for people with coronary artery disease. Doctors use tiny balloons to squeeze open clogged heart arteries. A major drawback of the procedure is restenosis, the spontaneous reclosing of the newly cleared arteries. This happens in about one-third of all patients within six months of their angioplasties. When the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> doctors tested fish oil on 82 men, they found that it cut the restenosis rate by two to three times in men who were at especially high risk of this complication. Reaction from other experts was mixed. Dr. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Leaf </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, who is conducting a major study of fish oil in angioplasty, said he believes the therapy works. But Dr. <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON>. King III of <ORGANIZATION> Emory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> commented: `` My main concern is that a lot of small studies have made it look like restenosis was helped by so many different interventions. I would like to see bigger numbers before I buy into this.'' The study was published in today's New England Journal of Medicine. One similar recent study also found that fish oil seemed to prevent restenosis, while two others showed no effect. `` Although it's in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, it's a little premature to rush out and buy a carload of fish oil for every angioplasty patient,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Baim </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Beth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, a co-author of one of the negative studies. The researchers said they do not recommend that all angioplasty patients take fish oil, because their study was too small to be the basis of sweeping recommendations. And they said people undergoing angioplasties should not take the supplements unless they discuss it with their doctors. However, Dr. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eichhorn </PERSON>, a co-author of the study, commented, `` If I were undergoing angioplasty, the balance of potential benefits versus risks is such that I would take it myself.'' Fish oil capsules, widely available in drug and health stores, have been advertised as a way of warding off heart disease, although evidence is still skimpy. Eskimos who eat large quantities of oily fish, such as salmon, have remarkably low levels of heart disease. However, doctors disagree over whether fish oil capsules will prevent the gradual buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries, a process called atherosclerosis, that underlies heart attacks. Leaf said the latest study suggests to him that fish oil capsules may be of benefit to everyone at risk of heart disease, not just those undergoing angioplasty. `` Since angioplasty restenosis pathologically appears to be a very rapid progression of atherosclerosis, the fact that they find they can prevent restenosis suggests that fish oil will prevent coronary heart disease and heart attacks,'' Leaf said. In the latest study, half the patients took 18 capsules of MaxEPA fish oil daily, starting a week before their angioplasties and continuing for six months. After three months, 19 percent of those who took fish oil had restenosis, compared with 46 percent in the comparison group.

 The landmark 1986 tax overhaul boosted the bite on 250 giant, profitable corporations by about $ 9 billion last year but still left 16 of them legally paying no federal income tax, a private research group said today. The number among the 250 that paid no tax was down from 40 in 1986 and from a high of 72 in 1982, according to Citizens for <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, a labor-financed organization whose reports were credited with helping win passage of the new tax law two years ago. The 1986 law cut tax rates for most individuals and corporations but took away or reduced several deductions and credits. One result was to shift about $ 125 billion of the federal tax burden from individuals to corporations over a five-year period.

<HEAD>Onset Of Dry Weather Doesn't Concern Yellowstone Firefighters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Warmer, drier weather was returning today but officials expressed confidence that the fires that have blackened half of the oldest national park would not flare anew. Meanwhile, a newspaper report said park officials allowed fires to burn unattended for nearly three weeks after they were ordered to fight all fires because they wanted to protect pristine areas from the destruction caused by bulldozers, fire engines and irrigation equipment. In all, the fires have blackened roughly half the park's 2.2 million acres. Elsewhere, officials banned outdoor smoking in parts of northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and hundreds of firefighters prepared to go home after a 9,000-acre blaze in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> was contained. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> confirmed what firefighters in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> already knew: This summer was one of the park's warmest and driest on record. The weather service said Wednesday that temperatures at the Mammoth area of the park in June averaged 55.4, or 7.8 degrees higher than average. Average temperature in July was 66.4 degrees, 2.8 degrees above average. Temperatures were just slightly above normal in August. Rainfall totals were more than an inch less than normal each month, and the weather service said it is unlikely any major precipitation will offset the park's shortage soon. Steady rain Tuesday prevented the remaining blazes from growing significantly. Although skies have since cleared, longer nights are bringing longer periods of `` humidity recovery,'' when small fuels such as pine needles and twigs can soak up moisture, area commander <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Dittmer </PERSON> said. `` The worst is over,'' <PERSON> Dittmer </PERSON> said. Forecasts for the weekend called for another cooling trend, accompanied by a chance of showers, which could help the 4,500 firefighters battling the blazes. Winds are expected to remain calm. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today that officials concerned about the destruction caused by firefighting equipment did not fight the Yellowstone portion of the Clover-Mist fire until nearly three weeks after <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON>'s July 21 order that all fires be fought. Bulldozers were allowed in the park only on a case-by-case basis even at the height of the fires, the paper reported, and bulldozers were never used to make fire lines around the <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> part of the Clover-Mist blaze, which has burned 411,000 acres in the park and the adjacent Shoshone National Forest. The Times also reported that park rangers threatened a firefighting crew with citations for destroying park vegetation when they crossed a meadow with their truck to extinguish a spot fire. Elsewhere, state firefighters battling blazes that have charred more than 40,000 acres in northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> issued an emergency decree banning outdoor smoking in portions of 44 counties. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Partain </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION>, said `` the extreme danger'' posed by fire and acute dry conditions prompted the decree. Fire officials predicted they will have the <LOCATION> Vacaville </LOCATION> fire out by Saturday evening. The blaze has destroyed seven homes, blackened 27,000 acres and caused an estimated $ 1.83 million in damage. In <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, 400 firefighters were scheduled to go home from the Shady Beach fire in <ORGANIZATION> Willamette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> after the blaze was contained at just under 9,000 acres Wednesday night, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Tonn </PERSON> said. Another 400 firefighters are scheduled for release Friday, leaving fewer than 1,000 on the lines, he said.

 A sniper taking cover in a park opened fire on passing cars, injuring an 18-month-old child and four other people and prompting the evacuation of nearby residents before apparently killing himself, police said today. A police search for the gunman ended at 3:45 a.m. when the body of the man was found in the back yard of a home, police said. In an unrelated attack, an off-duty policeman and his 3-year-old son were wounded by gunfire on a freeway in City of Industry late Wednesday, police said. City of Industry is a town about 15 miles east of here. No motive was known for either attack. In the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> attack, a gunman started randomly shooting at cars at about 11 p.m. Wednesday in a park on the city's west side, said Officer <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>. The victims were taken to <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, where one was in critical condition with a gunshot wound to the chest, <PERSON> Molony </PERSON> said. Two others were in stable condition, one with a gunshot wound to the jaw, the other with a gunshot wound to the hip. The 18-month-old and her mother were treated for minor gunshot wounds and released, he said. Residents in about 10 homes were evacuated, police said. Officer <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Anguiano </PERSON>, 24, and his son <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> were treated for minor gunshot wounds at White Memorial Medical Center in <LOCATION> Boyle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> following the 10:05 p.m. shooting on a <LOCATION> Pomona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Freeway </LOCATION> off-ramp in City of Industry, police said.

 A 7-year-old accused of making sexual remarks and waving an unloaded .38 - caliber handgun at his first-grade classmates will be transferred to another school after undergoing psychological testing, officials `` Looking at the severity and the sadness ... the boy is in need of some help. I intend to pursue psychological testing,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Polk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> school superintendent, said Wednesday. The outcome of the evaluation will determine whether he is sent to a school for children with emotional problems, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>, who oversees discipline for <LOCATION> Polk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> schools. <ORGANIZATION> Crystal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Principal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> W. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pace </ORGANIZATION> sent a letter home with students Wednesday, informing parents of a sheriff's investigation and assuring them their children were safe at school. `` It is also not fair to blame the school because this happened,'' he wrote. `` This could happen at any school.'' The boy, who told investigators he brought the handgun from home, was suspended immediately after the Sept. 12 incident, <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said. He apparently pulled the gun from his knapsack twice, once after a gym class and again after school. There reportedly were some sexual remarks shouted at a girl followed by angry banter between the boy and another boy, <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said. He also carried two bullets, but they were too large to fit the gun, which authorities described as a derringer. After receiving reports from investigators, <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said he was particularly disturbed by the `` level of violence and strange level of knowledge of sexual behavior at such an early age.'' `` We need to see what is at the root of the problem,'' <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> added. The boy and others from the group were questioned Wednesday to determine what happened. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said he will study results of that closed, fact-finding session before making any decisions. `` Expulsion may not be the best approach with a boy this age _ he would n't learn anything by expulsion,'' said <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>. Sheriff Detective <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Baggett </PERSON> said the boy may have made a derogatory sexual statement to a girl while the children were walking home, but his statement was not a demand for sexual favors, as some officials had reported earlier.

<TEXT>
 The new military ruler, <LOCATION> Gen </LOCATION>. Saw <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>, says the army does not intend to hold onto power and has asked opposition leaders to help restore peace and prepare for free elections, the opposition said today. Saw <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> made his remarks in a letter to pro-democracy activists <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> and Tin Oo. A copy of the letter was shown to The Associated Press today. The activists sent the general a letter Tuesday calling for dialogue to resolve the crisis that erupted after he seized power in a coup Sunday, toppling civilian President <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>. <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> is the third head of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s government in two months. By official count, troops have killed at least 144 people since the coup. A <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> ambassador said the actual death toll may be as high as 400. <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> was calm today with no street demonstrations for the third consecutive day, after daily demonstrations the past two months. The government has described the dead as looters and `` destructive elements,'' but the ambassador said many of them were unarmed, peaceful protesters demanding democracy. In a reply letter Wednesday, <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> did not directly respond to the call for dialogue. He asked for help in restoring law and order and preparing for the polling that <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> had promised. Saw <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> has not given any date for the elections, the first under a multiparty system since 1960. The letter said: `` The army has no intention to retain the duties of state power for a long time, in addition to its existing onerous duties. We had to step in unavoidably because of the deteriorating general conditions in the country. ... `` We promise you that free and fair general elections will be held as soon as peace and tranquility is restored in the country, and we hope you will cooperate with us to achieve this objective. `` Arrangements will be made to permit the use of government radio and television by the political parties before the election takes place.'' Saw <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> was named prime minister Wednesday, after having become both defense and foreign affairs minister in the nine-member cabinet formed the day before. Six ministers are among the 18 top military officers who helped the 59-year-old career officer seize power. In <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, more roadside shops were open than the previous day, but larger markets remained closed. The doors of government offices were open, but no one was working. Most public employees have been on pro-democracy strikes since Aug. 8. Sketchy reports received today from <LOCATION> Mandalay </LOCATION>, the second-largest city, and other towns indicated there was fighting earlier this week between security forces and protesters, though not as fierce as in the capital. Opposition leaders had succeeded in keeping the protests peaceful, but that changed after Sunday's coup. Mobs have attacked government targets with weapons seized from police stations and other places. One group opened fire with a grenade launcher and automatic weapons late Tuesday at soldiers guarding the City Hall and the main government administration building in downtown <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. The past two months of turmoil began after long-time strongman Ne Win resigned in late July and widespread riots flared against hard-liner <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, his successor. <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> resigned Aug. 12. <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> became on Aug. 19 the first civilian leader since 1962 and promised elections that would end the exclusive rule of the <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. But the opposition rejected that plan and protests persisted to demand an interim government to conduct the balloting. Diplomats say <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>, like <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>, is a close associate of Ne Win and the coup may have been staged to preserve the ruling military autocracy. Ne Win's coup ended <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s brief experiment with democracy and began a quarter century of rigid, inept central planning that ruined the economy of one of the <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> countries most richly endowed in natural resources. <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, once the world's largest rice exporter, last year joined 40 other countries officially designated by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> as `` least developed nation.''

 Two of the Hunt brothers who once shared one of the world's wealthiest legacies have filed for personal bankruptcy protection, their latest attempt to recover from an alleged scheme to corner the world silver market. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization Wednesday because of a court's requirement that they post a $ 225 million bond to appeal their loss in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> federal court, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON>, a spokesman for the brothers A federal jury decided Aug. 20 that the two Hunts and brother <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> must pay more than $ 130 million in damages to <ORGANIZATION> Minpeco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION>, the Peruvian government's mineral marketing company. The company alleged in its civil suit that the brothers conspired in the late 1970s with <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> businessmen in a failed attempt to corner the silver market, ruining <PERSON> Minpeco </PERSON>'s investments A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge has temporarily stayed the bond. `` Given that <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> was at one time one of the wealthiest men in the world, it's absurd to imagine they've come to this point,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON>, trial attorney for <ORGANIZATION> Minpeco </ORGANIZATION>, told The <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. The Hunts also face class-action suits in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on behalf of more than 17,000 silver futures traders who lost money when silver prices crashed in early 1980. In addition, the <ORGANIZATION> Commodities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has proposed an $ 80 million fine against the brothers. The brothers' separate bankruptcy filings, which could have the effect of blocking such lawsuits, list substantial assets but no dollar figures. The Hunts said raising $ 225 million in the <LOCATION> Minpeco </LOCATION> case would force a `` fire sale'' of assets, and would result in non-payment to business and personal creditors. The Hunts also said they chose bankruptcy to keep <ORGANIZATION> Minpeco </ORGANIZATION> attorneys from beginning foreclosure on their assets until their appeal can be made. Hunt attorney <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolin </PERSON> said the case may not even reach the appeal stage. He said he has `` six or seven separate motions'' that could either reduce the damages substantially, bring about a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, or force a new trial. `` It's very winnable,'' <PERSON> Wolin </PERSON> said. In brief summaries of their assets in the petitions, <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> listed 13,649 Byzantine coins, a 44-piece Roman and Greek bronze collection, a half-interest in a ski lodge in <LOCATION> Vail </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, between one-third and one-fourteenth interest in 3,442 acres in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, a 3-year-old Cadillac and a 15-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benz </ORGANIZATION>, the Morning News said. Bunker Hunt listed ancient coins, art objects, bronze statues, oil and gas properties in 40 counties nationally, three gas plants, 14 ranches, 1,390 acres of undeveloped land, a condo in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, five cars and other assets. Both brothers listed the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Minpeco </PERSON> as unsecured creditors with a miniscule $ 1 disputed claim. They also listed <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> as an unsecured creditor owed $ 36 million. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> bank filed suit Friday in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> attempting to collect on the 4-year-old note. The bankruptcy filing is the latest chapter in the Hunts' struggle to hang on to what is left of the fortune they inherited from their father, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oilman H.L Hunt. Heavy losses in silver, oil and real estate cut the trio's wealth from more than $ 5 billion to an estimated $ 1 billion, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> The brothers' trust funds subsequently filed for bankruptcy. Last Friday, a federal bankruptcy judge approved a reorganization plan to settle $ 750 million in loans and pull the trust funds out of Chapter 11. The plan called for turning their financially strapped <ORGANIZATION> Penrod </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drilling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which is not in bankruptcy, into a corporation jointly controlled by creditor banks. That plan was part of a settlement aimed at ending litigation between the Hunts and the banks, which the Hunts claimed were trying to force them out of business by refusing to renegotiate $ 1.5 billion in loans. The agreement called for the brothers to pay $ 53.8 million in cash and surrender real estate to resolve $ 200 million in debt. <ORGANIZATION> Placid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, owned by the Hunt trusts, also is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The trusts had offered in July to pay $ 803.5 million to Placid's lenders.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> today ordered the explusion of three Czech diplomats, including two military attaches, for engaging in `` activities incompatible with their status.'' The terse announcement by the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> was couched in the diplomatic parlance for spying. The statement said the Czechoslovak ambassador, <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fidler </PERSON>, was summoned to the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> this morning and told the three must leave <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> within 14 days. The expelled diplomats were Maj. <PERSON> Bedrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramar </PERSON>, the assistant military and air attache; Maj. <PERSON> Vlastmil </PERSON> <PERSON> Netolicky </PERSON>, a member of the military attache's staff; and <PERSON> Paval </PERSON> <PERSON> Moudry </PERSON>, a member of the commercial section. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> last expelled Czech diplomats in 1984 when two were ordered out, and Communist <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> expelled two diplomats in retaliation. Two other Czech diplomats had been ordered out the previous year. `` The foreign secretary -LRB- Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> -RRB- wishes it to be clearly understood that, while we wish to build up our relations with <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, we are not prepared to relax our policy on the sort of activities to which May. <PERSON> Kramar </PERSON>, Maj. <PERSON> Netolicky </PERSON> and Mr. <PERSON> Moudry </PERSON> had engaged,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> announcement said.

 Prosecutors are seeking to step up charges against confessed <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> hijacker <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> to include a count of attempted murder of an American passenger, a court spokesman said today. The Lebanese Shiite Moslem defendant already is on trial for murder, air piracy and other charges stemming from the June 1985 ordeal in which a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver was killed. Court spokesman <PERSON> Falk </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said that after recent dramatic testimony from <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> passengers and crew members, <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> prosecutors have asked the court to include a charge of attempted murder of American passenger <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>. Witnesses have testified that <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> and his accused fellow hijacker, <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ezzeddine </PERSON>, mercilessly beat the <LOCATION> Rockford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, man during the hijacking that kept 39 Americans captive for 17 days. `` The prosecutor's office has asked the court to formally notify <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> that his actions can be judged as attempted murder,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in an interview. `` The court will still have to decide whether such a charge is included,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> added. He said `` there is no time pressure'' for the court to make such a decision. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said that the maximum sentence for attempted murder is a life prison term. In the latest testimony regarding <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, chief flight attendant <PERSON> Uli </PERSON> <PERSON> Derickson </PERSON> on Wednesday described how <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> was attacked by both hijackers, and said that he lay quietly near the cockpit. `` I was convinced he was dead, because I had to step over him several times,'' the 44-year-old Mrs. <PERSON> Derickson </PERSON> said. `` But then I touched him and he moved.'' The flight attendant said she then told <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> of <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>'s family, and <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> apologized to the beaten <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> officer saying `` I did n't mean to kill you. <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> survived the ordeal and has also testified at <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s trial about his beatings On Wednesday, Mrs. <PERSON> Derickson </PERSON> broke down in sobs as she talked about the lasting psychological impact of the hijacking. `` I can imagine everyone on that flight is suffering,'' she told the court. `` I suffered deep psychological effects, and I am still under therapy.'' <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, who prosecutors say is 24 years old, has admitted taking part in the hijacking but has denied killing <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Waldorf </LOCATION>, Md. But <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Testrake </PERSON>, the pilot, testified last week that he believed <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was the hijacker who shot and killed <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was arrested at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> airport on Jan. 13, 1987, after customs officials found liquid explosives in his luggage. In the week following his arrest, two West Germans were kidnapped in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in a failed scheme to win his release. Kidnappers have since released both West German hostages. In addition to murder and air piracy, <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> has also been charged with hostage-taking, causing bodily harm and robbery. He also is on trial on charges of smuggling explosives and use of falsified documents stemming from his arrest at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> airport. The <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jet was hijacked to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on a flight from <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> in June 1985.

 A tentative agreement that would end a provincewide civil service strike over wages was reached after nearly 15 hours of talks. `` It does n't go all the way but it goes far enough that the bargaining committee is prepared to recommend it to the membership,'' union president <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Shields </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` We hope that we can get them back to work.'' During the strike that began Saturday, about 27,000 of the union's 29,000 members stayed out of work, closing government offices and liquor stores. Mediator <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Munroe </PERSON> said he expected ratification to be completed Saturday and workers back on the job by Monday. An exhausted <PERSON> Munroe </PERSON> told a late-night news conference Wednesday that a three-year deal had been reached that includes a wage increase of 5 -LCB- percent, retroactive to Aug. 1, and increases 5 and 5 -LCB- percent in the following two years. The deal came after Premier <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Vander </PERSON> <PERSON> Zalm </PERSON> said there should be more money for some provincial government employees. One <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> clerk with two children said issues welfare checks larger than her pay to families the same size as hers. During the strike, the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> opened an emergency center in <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION> to handle urgent cases. Regular mail delivery of welfare checks was n't affected. Prison guards and some health-care workers, considered to be essential services, stayed on the job.

 Calm prevailed today in a tense, impoverished neighborhood where rioting by hundreds of blacks was triggered by an interracial, drug-related killing. Neighborhood school officials said today that classes would be open, although absences would be excused if parents wished to keep their children home. The almost exclusively black area known as <LOCATION> Cedar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION> became the province of rioters and looters for about five hours Tuesday night and early Wednesday after a black man was killed by a white woman shopping for cocaine, according to police and witnesses. At least one witness said the victim was a bystander. Less intense violence surfaced again Wednesday night in the state's second-largest city, despite pleas for calm by black ministers and politicians. Police detoured traffic when cars passing by the neighborhood were pelted with rocks, bricks and bottles. Then they sealed off a 12-block area when gunshots were heard. At least one fire was set in the area, but a crowd of about 200 youths began to disperse by midnight. `` It's mostly a very calm situation,'' Mayor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussey </PERSON> told reporters when police began to withdraw around midnight, leaving heavy patrols to investigate scattered reports of gunfire. `` Most of the area I saw was still secure.'' The riot was centered near a park where police said dealers provided `` curb-service crack.'' Ten years ago, the neighborhood was a mixed-race working-class area, but it has become increasingly poor, violent and dangerous, authorities said. Vacant buildings give the appearance of a war zone and drug dealers have intimidated the elderly and families. High teen-age unemployment and a feeling that police had failed to provide equal protection for blacks have made the area `` a time bomb waiting to explode,'' said state Sen. <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarver </PERSON>, a black former city councilman. `` You can come through here any time, get robbed, get cut, get shot,'' added <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenner </PERSON>, a policeman who has patrolled Cedar Grove from midnight to dawn the past seven years. `` There'll be 100 people standing around and nobody saw anything.'' There were no arrests or injuries Wednesday night, but the windshield of a pickup truck containing three whites was shattered in three places and its passenger-side window was smashed out. Officials said the trouble was triggered by the Tuesday night slaying of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON>, 20, who lived in the neighborhood. A witness said <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> just happened to be standing nearby when <PERSON> Tamala </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vergo </PERSON>, who was shopping for cocaine, opened fire on some men who snatched her purse. <PERSON> Vergo </PERSON>, 17, was being held today on a charge of second-degree murder, police said. Another woman, apparently a companion, was questioned but no charges were filed, said police Cpl. E.T. Rushing. At least five blacks were arrested during the rioting on misdemeanor charges ranging from inciting a riot to resisting arrest, police said. Some of them also were booked for looting. All remained in jail today. Reporters at the scene said some of the rioters shouted `` Hot Biscuit,'' the name of an all-night restaurant where a white teen-ager shot a black teen-ager to death on Aug. 4. When arrested, the admitted gunman claimed he acted in self-defense. The mayor and Police Chief <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Gruber </PERSON>, along with black political and religious leaders, appealed for calm after a meeting Wednesday. <PERSON> Hussey </PERSON> and the Rev. <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a local pastor and president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, agreed problems run deep throughout <LOCATION> Shreveport </LOCATION>'s black community. `` We've got problems in our economy, we've got problems in our racism, we've got many other problems,'' <PERSON> Hussey </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hussey </PERSON> said the strategy again Wednesday night was to wait out the troublemakers. By 11:30 p.m., scores of police cars, a busload of camouflaged Special Response Team officers and canine units were withdrawn from a command post at a nearby elementary school. Police remained stationed at two major intersections and beefed up patrols to investigate scattered but unconfirmed reports of gunfire and fires well after midnight. <PERSON> Gruber </PERSON> refused to give details about the investigation into the riot or the shooting that preceded it. The chief said a brick was thrown through the windshield of his own car and shots were fired through the back passenger door, but he was not hurt. A KTBS-TV news car was burned and a new fire department pumper was attacked with bats and bricks. A man who identified himself only as <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, a cousin of <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON>'s, said <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> was shot at random after a woman tried to buy some cocaine from a group of men and was robbed. When they ran away with her purse, she `` took out her frustration'' on <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON>, he said. The man talked to reporters after being interviewed by detectives as a witness to the shooting. Police would not comment on his story.

A spokesman for the vice president said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met with <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s then-President <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> de la Espriella and other officials, including <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in 1983 But, he added, `` There is nothing to indicate the vice president spoke with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, chairman of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presidential campaign, responded to questions about the matter on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> `` This Morning'' today. `` You're going to hear a lot of rumors and specualation as this campaign moves through its last 47 days,'' he said. <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blandon </PERSON>, a former senior intelligence officer in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, also said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> claims to have pictures and tape recordings that would link <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or his aides to secret training of Nicaraguan rebels. From October 1984 to October 1986, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law prohibited any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government aid to the Contras in their fight to topple <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista government The documentary did not say when the pictures were taken nor when the tape recordings were made. `` We have learned that as early as 1983 ... <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sat down with Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to complain about th laundering of drug money in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' reporter <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Manyon </PERSON> said on the <ORGANIZATION> Thames </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> program, which was screened for reporters Wednesday. `` One of the vice president's concerns, according to Panamanians who were there, was an estimated $ 3 billion of drug profits that had already been laundered through <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Manyon </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was shown on the documentary saying he never met <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> nor had any contact with him. `` Your source of information is mistaken,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said Wednesday the vice president spoke of drug interdiction efforts when he met with <PERSON> Espriella </PERSON> during a stopover in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> but did not speak of any allegations against the general. `` The vice president dealt with <PERSON> Espriella </PERSON>. One of the topics they discussed was money laundering in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said. `` They also talked about drug interdiction efforts. ... There is nothing to indicate the vice president spoke with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Manyon </PERSON> said the meeting took place Dec. 10, 1983 at the VIP lounge of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s airport. According to a black-and-white photograph shown of the gathering, <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> attended the meeting. <PERSON> Manyon </PERSON> said the meeting raised `` important questions'' about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s claims the administration acted as soon as it learned of allegations against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> concerning the laundering of drug profits. <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>, who was interviewed in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, said he once saw <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> examining photographs which apparently showed Contras being secretly trained in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> under an arrangement with Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide dismissed over the Iran-Contra scandal in which profits from arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> were allegedly funneled to the Contras. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> suggested that the tapes and photos gave him an advantage over <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, according to <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>, who has accused <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> of corruption, electoral fraud and political murder. In the TV interview, <PERSON> Blandon </PERSON> replied, `` Of course'' when asked if he believed `` people inside the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign are aware of the threat that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> poses for them'' by allegedly having tape recordings about the illegal training of Contras. <PERSON> Blandon </PERSON>, a witness at a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> hearing investigating <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, said the general has sent a message to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign officials that he has the tape recordings. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said it was no secret the vice president was in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in 1983. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was down in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> for the inauguration of President -LRB- Raul -RRB- <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>. He did a refueling stop in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and he met with President de la Espriella at the airport,'' <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said. `` One of the persons in the group was <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who was there to represent the Defense Forces. As for any picture showing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> together, <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said, `` When you meet with people in a meeting, you go around and shake hands.'' The documentary was to be broadcast tonight on <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s commercial <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>

<TEXT>
 Hundreds of chanting, flag-waving <PERSON> Slavic </PERSON> students called a school strike today and marched around the capital of ethnically troubled <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, protesting alleged harassment by Albanians. About 1,000 teen-agers marched behind the red, blue and white flag of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s largest republic, <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, after going to four schools to declare a boycott of classes and collect supporters for their protest. Plainclothes police kept a close watch, but there was no atempt to interfere and uniformed police stopped traffic on the main thoroughfare to allow the marchers to pass. The march illustrated the high level of tension in this city of 200,000. `` We are afraid to go to school,'' said the students when youth officials tried to persuade them to return to class. On Tuesday night, about 5,000 Serbs and Montenegrins, both Slavs, rallied after a Serbian girl allegedly was attacked by an ethnic Albanian Monday night. That rally was one of the latest in a series of meetings backing <ORGANIZATION> Serbian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Slobodan </PERSON> <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>, who wants more control over <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s two autonomous provinces of <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, one of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s poorest and most backward regions, has a history of ethnic tension between Serbs and Montenegrins, who see the province as their historic homeland, and the Albanians, who now make up about 90 percent of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s 2 million people. In 1981, ethnic riots left at least nine dead and prompted federal authorities in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> to impose martial law for a few weeks. <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s Albanians have not yet staged any public protests in response to the current wave of Slav rallies. But Serbs allege individual harassment by Albanians have increased and nervous residents in both ethnic groups report tension at a high level. Federal authorities dispatched extra police units, equipped with armored pesonnel carriers, to <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> earlier this month. Today's protest started when about 200 Slav teenagers walked up the central downtown street, chanting `` <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>,'' and `` We will give our lives, but we will not give <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>.'' Some participants said the march was sparked by the alleged rape attempt Monday night, but others said there had been fresh trouble Wednesday involving a fight between Albanian and Serbian students. A worried <LOCATION> Serbian </LOCATION> mother, who did not identify herself, sobbed outside one school: `` Children should not solve problems. I have a child in there. I am afraid.'' A Serbian woman, looking at the march, said, `` What will happen now? Albanian kids know who is marching and they could do something.''

 A deranged man ran naked into <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>'s Cathedral, then killed an elderly usher and seriously injured a police officer with an iron prayerbook stand before being shot and killed by police, officials said The 250-pound attacker, identified as <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> DelGado </PERSON>, 32, of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, had attended morning Mass celebrated by Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> prior to Wednesday's attack and stood directly before the cardinal as he administered the Holy Eucharist, <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> told reporters. `` I felt he was totally disoriented. The cathedral is a magnet for all people. People sleep in it and engage in the strangest behavior in the cathedral. I patted him on the shoulder and said, ` God bless you.' He stood for a moment and left,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> performed a purification rite before the 8 a.m. Mass today. The Rev. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Finn </PERSON>, a spokesman, said the rite is performed `` whenever a sacred place has been violated and profaned.'' It was the first time the rite was performed in the 109-year history of the cathedral. `` While the cathedral has been desecrated, while this magnificent temple of almighty God, famous throughout the world, has been violated, we must not forget that two men were killed here last night,'' the cardinal told several hundred people who attended the morning service. `` It is for their souls I will be offering this Mass, as well as for the purification of the cathedral,'' the cardinal said. Wednesday evening, the man tore off all his clothes down the street from the historic midtown cathedral, walked one block to the church, chanting under his breath and carrying red carnations, according to witnesses. `` He suddenly stopped, stripped, and headed up the street. He was obviously disturbed,'' said a witness, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, 56. `` He was not aware of anybody else.'' Upon entering the church he repeatedly struck a woman praying in a pew, ripped the prayer book stanchion from the marble floor where it was bolted near the front altar, and then used it to strike and kill the 77-year-old usher, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Winters </PERSON>, and wound officer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McMann </PERSON>, police and witnesses said. `` Everyone backed away. Then the cops rushed in. -LRB- The woman -RRB- was screaming very loud that she was getting hit and needed help. But everyone was running away from her. We ran,'' said another witness, <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>. About six or seven people were present as the man began to attack the woman, said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>. `` He starts hitting her with his hand and he starts punching her.'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said that after the woman ran out of the church he told the police officer that `` ` a man is running around nude in the church, by the altar now and he's unarmed.' And the cop tries to convince him to leave.''' Meanwhile, the attacker `` picks up a metal stand and starts swinging it around, go wild crazy, and he hits the cop a couple of times,'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. A backup police unit arrived and shot the attacker once in the chest, killing him, said Sgt. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON>, a police spokesman. He fell to the floor in a center aisle, police said. The 3-foot-long metal stanchion was found about 7 feet away from him, said Detective <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON>. Winters, a <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> resident, died inside the front rail of the altar near the pulpit, police said. He suffered a large gash to the head, <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> said. <PERSON> McMann </PERSON>, 50, suffered a head injury that did not appear to be life-threatening, said Police Capt. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Valentine </PERSON>. He was in serious but stable condition early today at <LOCATION> Bellevue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Marletta </PERSON>, a hospital administrator. The woman's identity and her injuries were not immediately known, police said. The cardinal said the man allegedly had committed acts of minor vandalism in and around the church in the past. `` Two people are dead and a police officer is seriously wounded,'' the cardinal said. `` There is no tragedy comparable to that. It's very serious to me and all Catholics.'' Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, who embraced <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> at the conclusion of a news conference outside the cathedral, said, `` We are very lucky he did n't assault the cardinal.''

<TEXT>
 Student demonstrators today burned effigies of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> and persisted with demands that the Olympic Games be shared with rival <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. About 1,700 students from 12 universities in the capital took part in the demonstration at <ORGANIZATION> Yonsei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> to demand the communist north be allowed to co-host the Games, which began Saturday and end Oct. 2 The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Olympic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has ruled the Games can not be shared because they are given to a single city. The students also called for expulsion of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has 42,000 troops based in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> under a mutual defense treaty. The Korean peninsula has been divided since 1945. `` Oppose dictatorial Olympics!'' the students yelled. Two thousand riot police wearing combat fatigues and black visored helmets blocked the way when the students marched to the school gate and appeared ready to move to the streets. The students, however, stayed inside the campus, and no confrontation occurred. Chanting slogans and raising their fists in the air, the students marched around the campus as speakers called for a drive to force out the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers stationed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Protesters burned figures with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Japanese flags painted on them. `` Yankee go home!'' students yelled. They charge the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> are helping strengthen authoritarian rule in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Speakers also claimed the Olympics heightened the risk of war on the divided <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> are on increased alert against possible threats from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> during the Games, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Japanese naval forces are helping patrol the surrounding seas. Huge placards hanging down the sides school buildings read `` Oppose the Olympics, which perpetuate the national division'' and `` No war and no nuclear bombs.'' In a related development, President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON> said today he has not decided yet whether to accept North Korean President <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON>'s proposal for talks with him because the proposal contains `` something unclear and ambiguous.'' `` I will have my position known after scrutinizing the real intention of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Joongang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, a Korean language national newspaper. The summit, if held, would be the first between the two Koreas.

 House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> defended himself today against charges that he improperly disclosed a covert <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> operation in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> as <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leaders formally asked for an investigation of his actions. `` I have n't revealed anything that was committed to me as secret or classified,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> told a reporter. `` I am not a member of the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. I have not been present at the secret, classified briefings. I have simply said what is generally known and what is true.'' But <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, declined to specifically say how he had learned of the covert operation in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, or whether he had been told of it informally by an <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> on Tuesday said he had received `` clear testimony'' from the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> that the agency had fomented opposition demonstrations in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to provoke the leftist Sandinista government and sabotage peace talks. He told a reporter later that <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> officials had made the admission under congressional questioning. He repeated the assertion to reporters today, noting that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration had not disputed it. `` In late August of last year I became aware that elements of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government were seeking to ... foment disturbances with a view to seeing if they could provoke'' the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> into a crackdown that would derail peace talks, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. `` That seems to me just intolerably two-faced,'' he said. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> added that he had been given `` indirect assurance'' that the practice has now been halted. To bolster his case that the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> activity already was well known, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> distributed a list of news stories that document agency activity in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The list included past <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> actions such as mining Nicaraguan harbors, secretly resupplying the Contra rebels and supporting opposition groups, but contained no specific mention of covert efforts at fomenting civil unrest and demonstrations. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., and Rep. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wyo </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, asked for an investigation of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s actions in letters late Wednesday to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics and intelligence `` Because of the possibility such a disclosure -LRB- of classified information -RRB- may have occurred, we are writing to ask your committee to promptly and thoroughly investigate the circumstances surrounding these events and to recommend appropriate action to the House of Representatives,'' <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said in a letter to ethics committee chairman <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Calif. In a separate letter to Rep. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> intelligence panel, they asked for an immediate meeting of the committee `` to discuss these matters, to ascertain whether any unauthorized disclosures have in fact occurred and to decide on an appropriate course of action.'' House Republicans were meeting today to discuss the <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> matter and in particular to weigh its implications for legislation that would tighten congressional control over the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>'s covert activities. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration opposes the bill, which is scheduled for floor consideration next week. A version already has been passed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where sponsor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Maine </LOCATION>, rose on the floor today to chastise <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. `` <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> people do not testify in open session,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. `` There is the clear implication that the speaker's statement could only have been derived from classified information in the possession of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Where did he obtain this information? On what basis did the speaker believe he had the privilege to speak to reporters about this classified information?'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said while the legislation may still be passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> next week, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s disclosure makes it less likely proponents will be able to muster the votes to override an almost certain presidential veto. `` The fact he has made -LRB- the disclosure -RRB- is serious,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., the senior Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` I am astounded to hear Sandinista propaganda coming out of the speaker's office.'' Asked during a photo session Wednesday about <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s comments, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` The reaction I have, and I think it should fit the speaker also, there is no way we should talk publicly about intelligence operations of any kind.'' But he declined to confirm or deny the substance of the speaker's disclosure, adding: `` If I start going down that road, then I'm creating the same violation that he did.'' `` We simply can not comment on covert operations or intelligence matters of this kind,'' White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` And sometimes that means having to accept information that may or may not be true.'' But <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters that at the outset of a meeting with the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> remarked that `` there is nothing that we are doing anywhere that was n't reviewed and approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> intelligence committees.'' `` That's an important point,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` because if <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has a problem, he ought to take it up with the intelligence committees.'' He added that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> `` has always been more than eager to take the position of the <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> government, but it's impossible to say what the real damage might be in this case. House rules stipulate that information given to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> nd other spy agencies, is classified and may not be disclosed except under certain tightly controlled circumstances. Unauthorized disclosure is subject to investigation by the ethics committee.

 <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>'s exercise videotapes are back on the shelves of a <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> submarine base store after the commanding officer reversed a decision to remove them, a base spokesman said.

 A fire broke out today aboard a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> oil drilling vessel off <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>'s east coast, and supply vessels evacuated all but two of the 67 people on board, the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said. `` They're being evacuated, but two people are unaccounted for,'' said <ORGANIZATION> RAF </ORGANIZATION> Flight Lt. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Tonkin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kinloss </LOCATION> base, which monitors coast guard operations in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. The Ocean Odyssey, a mobile, sdrilling rig vessel, was operating about 100 miles east of <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> when a fire alert was sounded at 1:15 p.m. -LRB- 9:15 a.m. EDT -RRB-, <LOCATION> Tonkin </LOCATION> said. The vessel is operated by the Los Angeles-based <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Riemi-submersible </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> chfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Tonkin </LOCATION> said. Supply vessels in the area picked up evacuated workers, and five helicopters, a <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> reconnaisance aircraft and a British warship were at the scene, he said.

 Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign will spend a modern record of about 60 percent of its $ 54 million budget for television advertising this fall, a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aide said today. Presidential campaigns traditionally set aside about half of their federally restricted funds for paid media and the other half for campaign organization. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aide, who spoke only on condition that he not be identified, said 60 percent or $ 32.4 million is `` a pretty accurate figure, which would make it the largest television expenditure in modern history.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, quoting an unnamed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aide, said the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> campaign is benefiting so much from the use of money raised by the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> for political activities that it can use a far larger share for advertising. Both campaigns are limited by federal law to a $ 54 budget, with $ 46 million coming from the federal treasury. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gearan </PERSON>, a spokesman for Democratic nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, said Wednesday, `` I think we'll be competitive with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign, but beyond that we do n't detail our spending.'' He said the high amount spent by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign is not surprising `` in this market.''

<TEXT>
 A new court decision may finally end a 23-year-old racial discrimination case filed by black workers at an <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> railroad car manufacturing plant. The 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> issued a ruling Wednesday in the workers' case against <ORGANIZATION> Pullman-Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pullman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The court gave a partial victory to the workers, ordering a lower court to determine damages for workers who suffered discrimination between 1965 and 1974 but ruling in favor of the company in other aspects of the case. `` Few cases better represent the idea that the road to justice can be a long and tortured one,'' Circuit Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> wrote in a prologue to the decision. Complaints of racial discrimination were first brought by the workers shortly after President <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> signed legislation that accommodated such claims. At the time, according to court documents, the factory in <LOCATION> Bessemer </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, was divided into 28 departments, some of them integrated but many either all-white or all-black. The black jobs paid less. In 1965, an arbitration decision opened up some jobs to blacks, but <PERSON> Pullman </PERSON> stopped its on-the-job training program that enabled many blacks to attain the skills needed to work at the plant. Four years later, <PERSON> Pullman </PERSON> entered into an agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> to encourage blacks to move into the previously all-white departments and develop a program of outside vocational development. But several complaints of racial discrimination were filed with the <ORGANIZATION> Equal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> between 1966 and 1969. In 1972 the commission consolidated all the complaints and found that <PERSON> Pullman </PERSON> had discriminated in hiring, promotion and job assignments. Just before the commission's ruling, worker <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Swint </PERSON> filed a class-action lawsuit contending that <PERSON> Pullman </PERSON> practiced racial discrimination, and the case went to trial in 1974. <PERSON> Swint </PERSON> won, kicking off a litany of appeals, cross-appeals, trials and reversals. In the meantime, <PERSON> Pullman </PERSON> closed its <ORGANIZATION> Bessemer </ORGANIZATION> plant in 1982, putting some 3,500 people out of work. It was later purchased by <ORGANIZATION> Trinity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> and still makes railroad cars, employing about 600 people, said plant safety director <PERSON> Festus </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>. Many of the original workers have since died, according to court documents. Four trials were held on <PERSON> Swint </PERSON>'s lawsuit, and the case made it to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1982. After the fourth trial, in 1986, both sides appealed once again to the 11th Circuit. Wednesday, the appeals court upheld a lower court's ruling that <PERSON> Pullman </PERSON>'s seniority system was not created or maintained in order to further discrimination. The appeals court also said evidence showed that discrimination in departmental assignments ended in February 1969. But one issue was reversed in the workers' favor and sent back to <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, to determine damages. The appeals court said <PERSON> Pullman </PERSON> should be held liable for any discrimination occurring between October 1965 and January 1969 on job assignments. In addition, it said <PERSON> Pullman </PERSON> is liable for discrimination in promotions that happened between September 1966 and August 1974.

 A minister was convicted today of killing and beheading a church handyman and setting the church on fire in a bid to leave <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> and establish a new identity. The Circuit Court jury deliberated three hours Wednesday night and an hour this morning before finding <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> guilty of murder and arson. The sentencing portion of the trial was to begin later today. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>, 43, looked calm as the verdict was read. He was accused of killing handyman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Matheny </PERSON>, cutting off the man's head and other parts of his body to make identification difficult, and leaving the body in his <ORGANIZATION> Emmanuel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oneness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pentecostal </ORGANIZATION>, which he then set on fire. Prosecutors said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> killed <PERSON> Matheny </PERSON>, 32, in June 1987 in an attempt to make it look as though he himself had been slain, so that he could adopt a new identity and start a new life. <PERSON> Matheny </PERSON>'s headless body was found in the ruins of the church, but the head was never found. The exact cause of death was never determined. In his closing argument, Assistant District Attorney General <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> called <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> a calculating killer `` with ice in his veins, not blood.'' `` You may never hear of a more cold-blooded, brutal murder than this one,'' <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> said. Defense lawyer <PERSON> Lionel </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> presented no witnesses on <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>'s behalf and did not make a closing statement, saying `` the real trial will begin'' if the jury is asked to impose the death sentence <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> said he planned to argue that <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> was suffering from some sort of `` mental condition'' when <PERSON> Matheny </PERSON> was killed. <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> argued that <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> began planning the crime early last year, after receiving $ 50,700 from the sale of church property, unknown to other church officials, and after learning that he would not get a promotion he had expected. The prosecutor told the jury that <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> picked a name `` off a tombstone'' of a child who died in 1951 and began assembling identification papers in that person's name. The child had been born three days before <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> in 1944.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> today announced that it would take no action against those involved in the sale and default of $ 2.25 billion worth of <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supply </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> bonds. In a 376-page report on its five-year investigation, the commission staff criticized several parties involved in the sale of the bonds, which were issued to finance two nuclear power projects that later were terminated. The report concluded that enforcement action was unnecessary because of a civil trial, difficulty in determining responsibility for disclosure statements attached to the bonds and concern that the commission lacked the resources to pursue the case. Bondholders are suing 18 utilities that are members of <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION>, the construction arm of the state's public utilities system, plus a financial adviser and two engineering firms in a trial that began Sept. 1 in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz </LOCATION>. Most parties originally named as defendants in the suit, including <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> itself, have settled out of court for a total of $ 461 million, including $ 96 million in contested insurance claims. The report concluded that the default, the largest in municipal bond history, resulted from extensive cost overruns and construction delays at <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION>'s Project No. 4 at the <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> nuclear reservation and No. 5 at Satsop, west of <LOCATION> Olympia </LOCATION>. The power company, which issued the bonds, was responsible for the official statements used to sell them but `` avoided disclosure of negative developments,'' the report said. `` Most significantly, the supply system failed to disclose that, in October 1980, participants, who were concerned about rising project costs and falling power demands, asked the supply system to study a possible slowdown or termination of the projects.'' Work was halted on the projects in 1982, both were abandoned later that year, and in 1983 <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> quit making payments on the bonds after the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> held that the utilities' contracts with the consortium were illegal and thus unenforceable. Without payments from the 88 participating utilities, many of them in other states, <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> defaulted.

 Hurricane <PERSON> Helene </PERSON> is packing winds of 100 mph far off in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> and heading toward the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION>, but forecasters say it has a lot to prove before it should be considered dangerous. At midday today, <PERSON> Helene </PERSON> was centered near latitude 13.2 north, longitude 42.7 west, or about 1,125 miles east of <LOCATION> Barbados </LOCATION> and 2,500 miles east of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, about 100 miles closer than it was six hours earlier, according to a National Hurricane Center advisory issued just before noon. `` If it makes it all the way over to the west side of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>, there's a chance it could become much more significant, but it also has to go through a lot of wind patterns in the atmosphere that could mess it up,'' said <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lascody </PERSON>, a meteorologist at the center. The <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> hurricane season's eighth named storm was moving west at 10 mph. It was expected to maintain that path for a day or two, the advisory said. `` It's a long, long way from causing any problems,'' <PERSON> Lascody </PERSON> said. A nominal hurricane about 250 miles wide, <PERSON> Helene </PERSON> is the first hurricane to form since <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, which reached that status rapidly after it entered the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> last week thrashed <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Cayman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. Weather systems that form this month near the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> off <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s coast, as <PERSON> Helene </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> did, enjoy excellent hurricane-spawning atmospheric conditions. They are often the strongest of the six-month <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> storm season that begins June 1. `` The water's warm, the environment is favorable, conditions are right for some additional strengthening,'' said forecaster <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerrish </PERSON>. Forecasters could n't predict if <PERSON> Helene </PERSON> might become as fierce as <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, described as the century's most intense hurricane in terms of barometric pressure. The hurricane center expected to send a reconnaissance plane to check <PERSON> Helene </PERSON>'s growth on Saturday when the storm is closer, <PERSON> Gerrish </PERSON> said. Until then, forecasters will rely on satellite reports. `` This hurricane could do any of a number of things, but typically in this part of the ocean they do n't strengthen too much until they get closer to the <LOCATION> Windward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Lascody </PERSON> said. Tropical depressions _ winds swirling around a warm core of low pressure _ are named as storms when top sustained winds hit 39 mph, and reach hurricane status when top sustained winds hit 74 mph. Besides <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, which packed top winds of 175 mph, two small hurricanes formed this season. <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> brushed the Mexican coast, and <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> moved over <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>.

 Radio <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> said today that protesters attacked a prosecutor's office in the disputed region of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, which officials have sealed off and put under curfew because of ethnic unrest. One person was reported killed and 48 injured in clashes between Armenians and Azerbaijanis. Soldiers cordoned off streets and checked identification papers today in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> and the Armenian capital of <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>. A strike in the territory closed schools, transportation and many state-run enterprises and public gatherings were banned, the radio said. `` There are soldiers on every street, at every crossroad, checking passports and personal cars,'' said a man who answered the telephone at the state radio and television office, <PERSON> Gostelradio </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>'s main city of <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>. `` The situation is not improving. It has become even more threatening,'' Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> Perfiliev </PERSON> said at a news briefing in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Perfiliev </PERSON> said an Armenian man was killed and 48 people were injured in clashes in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. Thirty-two of the injured were Armenians and 16 were Azerbaijanis, the spokesman said. More than 30 buildings had been burned down, <PERSON> Perfiliev </PERSON> said. The government closed <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> to foreign journalists today, a day after barring travel to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> is a predominantly Armenian region of mainly Moslem <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. Armenians, most of whom are Christian, began pressing in February for its transfer to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. Blaming the violence on `` corrupt elements'' trying to distract attention from Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms, <PERSON> Perfiliev </PERSON> said `` such a situation, of course, can not be tolerated. We can not allow anarchy and the undermining of the rights of citizens under the Constitution.'' In response, a 9 p.m.-6 a.m. curfew was imposed in <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>, although most people had been staying home voluntarily because they feared more violence, said the man at <LOCATION> Gostelradio </LOCATION>. He said he was an ethnic Armenian, but would not further identify himself. In <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, soldiers blocked streets around government and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> buildings and protesters rallied to demand the Armenian Supreme Soviet again consider annexation of the enclave, an editor of the local <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> affiliate said in a telephone interview. One <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION> resident contacted by telephone from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> said food stores, the newspaper and radio and television stations were working, but that public transportation, schools and most other workplaces were closed. The resident said no one knew how long the `` special status'' imposed on Nagorno-Karabakh and on the Agdam region of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> on Wednesday would last. The official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the mountainous enclave's <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION> and Agdam regions were placed on a `` special status,'' lower than a state of emergency In <LOCATION> Copenhagen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> was considering use of `` some emergency action'' to deal with the unrest. He did not elaborate. An editor at the official Armenian news agency <ORGANIZATION> Armenpress </ORGANIZATION> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> that soldiers of the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> had taken up positions in the center of the Armenian capital. Radio <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, reporting on the situation in <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>, said `` an attack on the regional prosecutor's office was provoked.'' It did not say when it occurred or give other details. The radio also reported several arson attack on cars and scattered shooting.

 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> leads the nation in farm income, but when the states are rated in terms of dollars earned per acre, none comes close to <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. A new analysis by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for 1987 earnings said <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s net farm income was more than $ 5.58 billion. <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> was reported in 47th place at $ 46.4 million. <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> was at the bottom with $ 14.9 million. But the comprehensive Agricultural Income and Finance report, which was issued this week by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, also ranked the 50 states according to average net farm income per acre. <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> was at the top, averaging $ 636 per acre in 1987. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> was seventh at $ 174 per acre. And <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>'s per-acre average income was almost double second-place <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, which was reported at $ 352 per acre <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> was ranked 50th with an average net income of $ 2 per acre in 1987, the report said. Nationally, the average was a net income of $ 46 per acre. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> also led in net income per farm _ ranches included _ in 1987, averaging $ 73,790 per operation. <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> was second at $ 71,492 per farm, although the state placed 30th in total net income last year. <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> was third at $ 61,924 per farm. Nationally, the average was $ 21,286 per farm. `` Especially high net farm income per operation or acre reflects high-valued or relatively perishable crop usually produced near large metropolitan areas,'' the report said. `` Conversely, low net income per operation or acre typically occurs where farms are isolated or produce farm products which require a great deal of land.'' <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> had approximately 750 farms averaging 97 acres each, the report said. In contrast, last-place <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> had about 8,800 farms averaging 1,700 acres. `` The leading commodities for <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> were greenhouse, dairy products, eggs and potatoes,'' the report said. `` Such high-value, labor and capital intensive products tend to be typical of more populate states with small farms.'' <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>'s four leading commodities accounted for 65 percent of the state's total 1987 farm marketings. The value of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s four leading commodities _ dairy products, cattle, greenhouse and grapes _ accounted for 41 percent of total farm marketings, by comparison. `` The mix of land, labor and capital resources required for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s leading commodities is indicative of larger farms compared to those in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>,'' the report said. Here are the 1987 state rankings, in order, for net farm income per acre, in dollars per acre in the first column; the second column shows the average net income per farm in those states:

 Tobacco farmers have a bigger harvest this year, but old-crop inventories are smaller, meaning there will be a reduced total supply in the 1988-89 marketing year, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says. `` Stocks entering the new marketing year likely will equal 2.85 billion pounds, about 14 percent lower than a year earlier,'' the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday in a new outlook report. `` Although surpluses continue for some kinds and grades, there are shortages for others.'' Nationally, the 1988 tobacco harvest is up about 10 percent from last year because of increased acreage and greater yields, due to better weather for flue-cured and some other kinds of tobacco. However, dry weather kept burley yields below normal, but those still were up from last year's low levels. `` Prospects for world tobacco use next season indicate a small increase in sales and use of cigarettes and unmanufactured tobacco,'' the report said. `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tobacco use may increase from 1987-88's 1.66 billion pounds because of greater use of domestically grown tobacco in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cigarettes and higher cigarette production.'' The report said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cigarette output this year is expected to increase from 689 billion `` pieces'' in 1987 because of rising exports. However, cigarette consumption among Americans 18 years and older is expected to continue a long-term decline, dropping around 1.5 percent this year from an average of 3,196 cigarettes in 1987, which was the lowest since World War II. Cigarette use peaked at 4,345 pieces _ about 217 packs of 20 cigarettes each _ in 1963. The cigarette use figures are estimates that include smokers and non-smokers alike and are used as statistical comparisons from year to year. Flue-cured sales began July 26, and by Sept. 15 growers had sold nearly three-fifths of their anticipated 1988 marketings, the report said. Even with the larger crop, market prices are near last year's higher prices, averaging $ 1.545 a pound, less than half a percent below the 1987 level. As of September, this year's flue-cured crop was estimated at 780 million pounds, up 13 percent from last year. This year's burley production is expected to be up 7 percent from the small 1987 harvest and was estimated earlier this month at 449 million pounds.

 The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> has accused <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nevada-Reno </ORGANIZATION> officials of persistent discrimination and said its refusal to allow a gay rodeo at a campus arena is just the latest example. `` Face it, if you're not a friend of the university and if you're in some minority group, you do n't have a chance there,'' state <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> Executive Director <PERSON> Shelley </PERSON> <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> said. Her office is working on six discrimination cases against the school _ involving complaints based on sex, age, race and handicap _ and has joined one lawsuit. Ms. <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> held a news conference Wednesday in front of the <ORGANIZATION> Lawlor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Events </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> to protest the school's refusal to allow the national gay rodeo championship finals to be held there Oct. 22-23, despite organizers' successful efforts to raise an extra $ 9,600 to cover expenses in advance. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Klasic </PERSON>, general counsel for the state university system, denied the school and <PERSON> Lawlor </PERSON> wrongfully reneged on a verbal deal in which officials agreed to hold the event if backers presented the $ 9,600. `` The dates are taken for the basketball team to practice,'' <PERSON> Klasic </PERSON> said. `` This agreement was reached on Aug. 31 after it appeared that the rodeo would n't be taking place.'' `` There's not a word of truth -LRB- to the discrimination charges -RRB-,'' he added. `` The coaches simply feel that the more time spent practicing in <LOCATION> Lawlor </LOCATION>, the better the home court advantage.'' Ms. <PERSON> Chase </PERSON>, however, said the basketball team normally defers to scheduled events and practices elsewhere. `` It's just too much of a coincidence,'' she said. `` And we've been trying to talk to them and they wo n't even return our calls now. On Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rodeo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Silver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rodeo </ORGANIZATION> associations lost a court battle against <PERSON> Lawlor </PERSON>. A <ORGANIZATION> Washoe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge ruled that the groups had verbally modified a February written contract by agreeing to meet a pre-payment schedule to cover expenses for parking, security and other operating costs. But the rodeo organizers, who already had paid $ 7,300 to rent the arena, could only raise about $ 2,200 of the expense money and thus broke the contract, Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Forman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lawlor </PERSON> director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Linio </PERSON> told <PERSON> Forman </PERSON> the Oct. 22-23 dates were still open. And <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Sumpter </PERSON>, the attorney for the associations, said <LOCATION> Lawlo </LOCATION> officials later said the stadium would still hold the rodeo if the expense money were presented in advance. But when <PERSON> Sumpter </PERSON> told the university Tuesday that an anonymous businessman had written a check for the additional money, officials told him the stadium was booked, he said. <PERSON> Klasic </PERSON> said it was a simple mistake and <PERSON> Linio </PERSON> was n't aware the dates had already been taken by the team. <PERSON> Sumpter </PERSON> said his clients were continuing to look for a place in <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> to hold the October finals, in which the top riders and ropers from regional events compete.

 Sixty-year-old sedans and newer Porsches, Maseratis and Corvettes will open their throttles along a 93-mile stretch of remote <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> highway this weekend in the nation's first legal open-road race in decades. But the first Silver State Classic has no prize money, no ticket sales and spectators are not encouraged, said race organizer and two-time <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> 500 winner <PERSON> Rodger </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Vintage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Racing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Redondo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` This is not a spectator event,'' said <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, who won the 500 and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> championship in 1959 and 1962. `` This is a speed event all the way and is made so people with vintage cars can get them on the road and test them. `` No one will be allowed along the highways. Well, if people want they can watch the race start or wait at the finish line.'' `` There's really not much along the highway, mostly dirt roads, some driveways and farms,'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said. `` We'll have guards at all 32 highway access roads, though, so nobody gets it into their head to get in the way.'' That should n't be too difficult since the affected section of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> 318 through the mostly flat <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> crosses no other highways. Irrigation fields and distant ranch houses are the only signs of human life. The <ORGANIZATION> Nevada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nevada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> and the Nye, <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> and White Pine county commissions all had to give permission for the race, with the access guards as a condition, <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said. The federal government did n't become involved because it is a state highway. Drivers are to start out at one-minute intervals Sunday from Lund, a tiny eastern <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> farming town best known for producing one or two high school graduates each year. The faster cars racing southward will arrive about 45 minutes later at the finish line in <LOCATION> Hiko </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> seat in the late 1860s but now reduced to a ghost town 100 miles north of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. `` I do n't anticipate the cars running flat out, but some will get up there, going 160, 170,'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said. `` These cars are made for speed.'' The older vehicles will travel more sedately and arrive a little later. The cars will compete in five categories so the older ones are not outclassed. `` A lot of the drivers are people who just have an interest in vintage cars,'' said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` Others, with the faster cars, can take them out and really drive them. This is the ultimate high-speed run down a public highway. And it's legal.'' <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, music supervisor for the `` Matlock'' television series, planned to drive the 1968 Javelin he drove in the Trans-Am series in 1969 and 1970. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, who is not driving Sunday, said he would like to make the race an annual event. It is financed by entry fees from $ 100 to $ 250 depending on the type of car.

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> chided Republican rival <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today for once referring to Social Security as `` largely a welfare program,'' and promised never to use Social Security trust funds to help balance the federal budget. `` You know, when election time rolls around, Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> likes to say he is a great friend of older Americans,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told a lunchtime crowd at a senior citizens center in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` Maybe he thinks we all have amnesia,'' the Democratic nominee said. `` Because it was just over three years ago _ May 10, 1985 _ that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> cast the tie-breaking vote in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to deny you a cost-of-living increase in your Social Security and to make you pay more for your medical benefits. And <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> voted with him and against you.'' If elected, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, he and vice presidential running mate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> would `` stop the attack on Social Security and <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> and we'll stop it cold.'' Accompanied by his 85-year-old mother, Euterpe, and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> studying ways to reduce the budget deficit `` wo n't get to first base'' in a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> administration if it recommends cuts in Social Security benefits. `` I am committed to maintaining full benefits and cost-of-living increases,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` No matter what the commission recommends, as president I will ensure that the nation honors its commitments so that current and future beneficiaries can count on the promise of Social Security.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> took time out from preparations for his nationally televised debate with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Sunday at <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, to promise guaranteed health care for children and pregnant women, and to accuse the vice president of ignoring the needs of poor families. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides said <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> also may return to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> on Friday, when a campaign source said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is scheduled to take part in a mock debate. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> is standing in for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a role he played in 1984 when <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> was preparing for her debate with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spent much of Wednesday studying for the debate and has rented a meeting room in a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> hotel for practice sessions. New Jersey Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> was in town to offer advice Wednesday and is expected back Friday. <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> also is to visit <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in advance of the debate. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> also attended <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' only public appearance, his visit to <ORGANIZATION> Brigham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Women's Hospital to outline his `` Healthy Start'' program, which is modeled after a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> program that has provided services to 16,000 mothers since 1985. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> visited with two of them before delivering his speech. `` Today, more than 12 million children in this country grow up in families without a dime's worth of health insurance,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` Too many of these children do n't get checkups. They are n't treated when they are sick, and they've never seen a dentist. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said the Healthy Start program would provide money to states that adopt efforts similar to a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> program that has been cited as a factor in the state's declining infant mortality rate. It offers doctors' and hospital care to pregnant women who are uninsured or underinsured and also provides basic coverage for their babies. Aides said the federal program would cost $ 100 million in the first year but that the money would be saved within 12 months because the government would not have to pick up the tab for more expensive treatment of preventable childhood illnesses. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> contrasted his proposal with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s record, listing programs affecting poor families that have been targeted for cuts by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. `` He was there when his administration conducted an annual assault on immunization programs,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` He was there when they cut maternal and child health programs.''

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> formally apologized today for the internment of 22,000 Japanese-Canadians following <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s 1941 attack on <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> during World War II. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> said the Canadian government would provide $ 288 million in compensation to the 12,000 survivors. Most of that money _ $ 252 million _ will be given in $ 21,000 payments to each of the survivors. The remainder will go to the Japanese-Canadian community for educational, social and cultural activities and to finance a new Canadian Race Relations Foundation. `` No amount of money can right the wrong, undo the harm and heal the wounds,'' <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> told parliament as representatives of the Japanese-Canadian community watched, then stood and applauded from the public gallery. `` But it is symbolic of our determination to address this issue, not only in the moral sense, but also in a tangible way,'' <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> said. The Canadian leader said the internment was not only unjustified on moral and legal grounds, but `` it went against the grain of the country itself.'' `` Error is an ingredient of humanity,'' <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> said solemnly. `` So, too, is apology and forgiveness. We have all learned from personal experience that, inadequte as apologies are, they are the only way we can cleanse the past, so that we may as best we can in good conscience face the future. Japanese-Canadians were interned following the 1941 attack on <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. Property was seized and 22,000, including 17,000 citizens, were relocated or interned on the <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prairies </LOCATION> or in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> camps. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government decided this summer to pay $ 20,000 to each of the 120,000 survivors of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> internment camps.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Lapp </PERSON> reindeer herdsmen in villages hit by fallout from the 1986 <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear accident have thrown out all the animals killed this week because radiation levels were many times higher than allowed, a Swedish daily said Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Ostersunds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said 400 reindeer were discarded in the northern province of <LOCATION> Jamtland </LOCATION> after the annual slaughter when tests on the meat disclosed cesium levels ranging up to 4,500 Becquerels per pound. A Becquerel is a unit to describe the activity of radioactive substance. The approved government limit for the meat for consumption is about 680 Becquerels per pound. `` I'm beginning to lose faith that there is a future in raising reindeer,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahstrand </PERSON>, 22, a herder reached by telephone in his village of <LOCATION> Frostviken </LOCATION>. About 10 percent of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s total reindeer slaughter was banned for eating, the <ORGANIZATION> Ostersunds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. `` We raise reindeer for the garbage dumps. There is no sign that the cesium levels are being reduced by even a few Becquerels,'' said <PERSON> Ahstrand </PERSON>, who bought his first herd of 50 animals just before the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear plant in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> sent up a cloud of radioactivity in April 1986. Thirty-one people died in the world's worst nuclear plant disaster. <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> was badly affected by fallout because of a freak wind that carried the radioactive isotope cesium 137 over a belt of the northern and central regions. <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s 300,000 reindeer were particularly vulnerable because they feed on lichen, which soaks up cesium and is slow to dispose of the contamination. The Swedish government compensates the herders at market prices for the destroyed meat, but the semi-nomadic <ORGANIZATION> Lapps </ORGANIZATION>, or <PERSON> Samis </PERSON> as they prefer to call themselves, say their lifestyle has been threatened. `` We ask ourselves how long will the government keep on supporting us,'' said <PERSON> Ahstrand </PERSON>. Last year <LOCATION> Ahstrand </LOCATION> and other herdsmen rescued part of their reindeer by moving them 250 miles south to graze in an uncontaminated region. But the move was costly and difficult, and the herdsmen stayed home this year. `` We felt that we did n't belong there. We have lived in the mountains for so many centuries tending our herds among these fields, it is more than an occupation. It's a way of life,'' said <PERSON> Ahstrand </PERSON>.

 A roadside shoemaker jumped into a pile of blazing goods and burned to death after sanitation men seized his wares and set them afire, witnesses said Thursday. The witnesses said the shoemaker, whose name was not available, had collected enough capital as a beggar to set himself up with a roadside shop. A team of sanitation workers, enforcing a ban on street trading, raided the <LOCATION> Yaba </LOCATION> commercial district where the shoemaker worked. The traders fled, watching from a distance as the officials began burning their wares. Witnesses, including a <LOCATION> Nigerian </LOCATION> radio correspondent, said the shoemaker ran and jumped into the fire before anyone could stop him. Hundreds of shoppers and traders watched as he died. The street trading ban was imposed to reduce congestion on the streets of this city of more than 4 million people.

 Dozens of uniformed police manhandled a group of Georgian nationalists Thursday when they tried to protest near the site of a U.S.-Soviet citizens conference. <LOCATION> Georgian </LOCATION> activists said at least 15 demonstrators were detained after police hauled them away from the <ORGANIZATION> Georgian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> building on <LOCATION> Rustaveli </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, the main thoroughfare of the capital of the southern republic. Around the corner from the columned academy entrance, at the <ORGANIZATION> Georgian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Filmmakers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> building, representatives of both superpowers were discussing environmental problems. Former <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> correspondent <PERSON> Hedrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and former deputy chief of mission at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Combs </PERSON>, were among those who looked on as police dragged off women demonstrators by the hair and pushed others into cars. <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>, in the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> about 1,000 miles south of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, is hosting a six-day program ending Saturday for nearly 300 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, cultural figures, businessmen and citizens and their Soviet counterparts. The fourth annual exchange is co-sponsored by the state-sanctioned <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Friendship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> and the Chautauqua Institution of upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Some Georgians used the conference's two-day debate on human rights at the filmmakers building to urge their own government to safeguard a historic monastery and the Georgian language. The demonstrators at the Georgian academy exceeded 100 and made the same demands, including a call to scrap the Soviet army artillery range they say is damaging a nearby cultural treasure, the monastery of <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Garija </PERSON>. Preserving the monastery, 50 miles outside <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>, has become a crusade for many Georgians who regard it as a symbol of the people and their Christian religion. The unrest was part of widespread protests in the area. Troops patrolled the streets of <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s capital, and <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>, the main city of the disputed <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> territory of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. One man has died and 48 have been injured in clashes between Armenians and Azerbaijanis, officials say. Before noon Thursday, uniformed police rushed the square in front of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION>, forcing protesters to group instead on the steps of the Academy of Science building. <PERSON> Zviad </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomsakhurdjia </PERSON>, one of the protest's organizers, accused police of detaining well-known Georgian nationalists and human rights activists at home so they could not take part. Most of the protesters sat in the afternoon sun at the academy's entrance Fights and scuffles broke out between protesters and plainclothes officers who circulated in the crowd. One American witness said she saw a policeman take a shovel from a nearby construction site and hurl it into the mass of protesters. <PERSON> Gomsakhurdjia </PERSON> said policemen trying to arrest him and others ripped his coat to shreds. The protesters then moved to other sites in this city of more than 1 million people, and their ranks grew. About 275 staged a sit-in on the steps of <ORGANIZATION> Tbilisi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, and as dusk fell, an estimated 750 were gathered outside the offices of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s Supreme Soviet, the nominal parliament. Fourteen people who said they were arrested at the academy showed up later at the university and told the crowd they were released. They accused authorities of beating them. The crowd outside the university's main building sang the Georgian national anthem and 19th century songs about their homeland. No violence was reported at the Georgian Supreme Soviet or at the university. At the university, 70 to 80 uniformed policemen stood guard along with 25 officers from the regular armed forces, or <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> troops.

 About 1,700 students chanted slogans at an anti-Olympic rally Thursday and burned figures representing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, which they charge are bolstering authoritarian rule in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The students from 12 schools in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> demonstrated at <ORGANIZATION> Yonsei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> to demand that the Olympics in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> be shared with communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. They also called for an end to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military presence in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. `` Oppose dictatorial Olympics,'' the students shouted. After the rally, the protesters marched to the school's main gate, where they faced about 2,000 riot police blocking the way. The students did not try to march out and there was no confrontation. The protesters, chanting slogans and singing, marched around the campus as speakers called for a struggle to drive out the 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops stationed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> under a defense treaty. Protesters burned effigies of figures with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Japanese flags painted on them. `` Yankee go home,'' students yelled. Huge placards hanging down the sides of school buildings read `` Oppose the Olympics, which perpetuate the national division'' and `` No war and no nuclear bombs.'' Radical students condend that the `` half Olympics,'' boycotted by <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, raises the risk of war on the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula. Most of the demonstrations have been small and peaceful with just a handful of students taking part. The great majority of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> want the Games to be a success and oppose the demonstrations. Protesters denounced the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for helping to guard the Olympics from possible threats from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> are on increased alert and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Japanese naval forces are helping patrol the surrounding seas. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is boycotting the Games because its demand to co-host the Games was rejected. The International Olympic Committee said the Olympics could not be shared because they are awarded to a singl city.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> today launched a comprehensive review of their relations as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> hinted the two sides may be drawing nearer at resolving some of their differences. Asked if Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, who began the discussions with Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, had `` brought good news,'' the president replied, `` I think so.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who spoke briefly with reporters as he left the White House for a trip to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, did not elaborate. Later, however, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the Soviets had provided `` some ideas'' to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials of their proposals in advance. He declined to give details. The talks may be the last full-scale review of relations between the two superpowers before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> leaves office next January. Going into the meetings with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> told reporters he planned `` full-scope negotiations'' and had with him `` specific proposals in many areas.'' Speaking through an interpreter, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said, `` We have not come empty handed. As you can see we have a lot of baggage.'' He said the discussions would cover nuclear and space weapons along with conventional armaments and chemical weapons. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said the two sides will take up continuing differences over interpretations of the 1972 Anti-Ballistics Missile Treaty and will seek to narrow the gap on their joint effort to achieve reductions in strategic nuclear weapons. Also on the table will be proposals for reducing air-launched and sea-launched cruise missiles. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> arrived at the State Department two hours later than originally planned. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> had asked for the delay, complaining that he was tired after his trans-Atlantic flight on Wednesday. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s talks here will include separate meetings Friday with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The latter encounter is being held at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s request, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said, adding that Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has not asked for a meeting with the Soviet diplomat. But <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, during his remarks on arrival, appeared to leave open the possibility of a meeting with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. With no new summit meeting on the horizon and no prospect for a major arms reduction agreement, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s visit lacks some of the drama which has accompanied many of his previous 27 meetings with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> dating back to 1985. According to well established procedures, the agenda for the talks includes discussions on nuclear issues, human rights, bilateral issues and Third World military conflicts in which both countries have an interest. Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Rozanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridgway </PERSON> told reporters there is no possibility that the two sides will be able to resolve differences before the end of the year on their mutual goal of achieving 50 percent cuts in strategic ballistic missile warheads. Many of the unresolved issues involve ways to verify that each side is fulfilling its commitment. One area in which some progress may be possible centers on the Peaceful Nuclear Explosion Treaty, which was approved during the mid 1970's but never ratified. <PERSON> Ridgway </PERSON> said the two sides are `` very close'' to a an agreement governing verification of the treaty, which sets ground rules for use of nuclear weapons for such activities as building dams and altering the course of rivers. Once verification procedures are agreed to, the treaty will be submitted to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for ratification. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> also planned to discuss verification procedures for a second unratified treaty which limits to 150 kilotons the size of underground nuclear explosions each side may carry out. As part of an experiment to improve verification procedures, experts from the two sides have been monitoring each other's nuclear tests. Perhaps the most serious area of arms control contention between <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> involves a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demand for the dismantling of a Soviet radar facility at <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION>. The administration has said repeatedly that the installation violates the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty because it could be used to coordinate defense of Soviet missile silos or other military facilities. On regional issues, the two sides are encouraged by the prospects for agreement on the withdrawal of all foreign forces from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, a high priority administration goal. But <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s decision to continue arms shipments to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist government even after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid cutoff to the Contra rebels has been a major disappointment for the administration Administration officials have said that the Soviets have refused to negotiate seriously on this issue.

 Debate experts say that neither <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is any great shakes as a public speaker, and the winner of their first face-to-face showdown Sunday night may be whoever exceeds low expectations. Veteran forensic judges also agree that the candidates will try their utmost to observe the cardinal rule of presidential debates: avoid calamitous mistakes. That may be good politics, but it can make for dull debating, said members of the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> presidential debate judges panel. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Unger </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forensics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, and chairman of the judges' panel, said these high-stakes debates `` are exercises in error-avoidance by the candidates.'' <PERSON> Unger </PERSON>, who also chaired <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> panels that judged the presidential debates in 1976, 1980 and 1984, said it is rare for a candidate to make a major gaffe like <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>'s in 1976 when he insisted that Eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> was not dominated by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. All too often, he added, `` the candidates just sit there with their prepared answers desperately seeking out a question to which they can attach the answer.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Southworth </PERSON>, director of forensics and speech professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Redlands </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, said, `` I'm not convinced either one of them is going to be dynamic confronting each other. ...

You bring up an issue and they know where they're supposed to run and what to say,'' said <PERSON> Sferra </PERSON>. `` They're all so afraid they're going to say something wrong.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> engaged in 21 debates during the primaries with his rivals for the Democratic nomination, and he once moderated a public television debate series called `` The Advocates.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> faced off with his <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> rivals seven times. He also has a 1984 vice presidential debate with Democrat <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> under his belt _ the one about which he boasted afterwards that he `` tried to kick a little ass.'' <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxey </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, director of forensics at <ORGANIZATION> Emory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, said that in the primary debates, `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> demonstrated more range, positive and negative. He had very strong, persuasive responses when he was being attacked by -LRB- Al -RRB- <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> and -LRB- Jack -RRB- <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> in the early debates.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was `` real consistent. He does n't seem to make major goofs.

It's more obvious when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> speaks that he's working at what he's doing.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON>, national executive secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forensic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ripon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` has great debate skills, but he tends to be very monotone and flat in his presentation.'' He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` is a very strained speaker. His voice tends to get a little screechy when he's excited.'' <PERSON> Sherry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, debate coach at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, said that in collegiate debates, content wins more points than style. But in these presidential debates, `` the emphasis is much more on style,'' she said. `` That's what people remember. With -LRB- President -RRB- <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> four years ago, people remember how he looked, not what he said,'' she said. The seven-member panel will use a scorecard similar to that employed in collegiate and scholastic debates to determine a winner of the Sept. 25 Bush-Dukakis debate. It will also evaluate their second debate on Oct. 13 or 14, and their running mates' Oct. 5 encounter.

The Iranian navy can defuse magnetic, contact and other types of mines, the officer was quoted as saying. He said the operations underlined `` the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>'s commitment to maintaining security and guaranteeing the safety of shipping in the region. The report could not be confirmed independently. A United Nations-sponsored cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war began Aug. 20. When <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s naval commander, Rear Adm. <PERSON> Mohammad-Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Malekzadegan </PERSON>, announced last week that his forces would begin mine-clearing operations, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said that was `` tantamount to admitting that they laid the mines'' during the 8-year-old war. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has never admitted it laid mines in the waterway's shipping lane, but said it did so in its coastal waters for defense. But <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> boasted last year that it could sow mines `` like seeds'' in the gulf. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> captured the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> Ajr, an Iranian naval vessel, in the gulf a year ago while it was allegedly laying mines at night. Several mines were found aboard the ship and others it had laid were found nearby. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> gave no other details on the mine-clearing or specify where it was being carried out. The naval officer said only that the operation was being conducted in `` international waters'' in the 600-mile-long gulf. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and other Western navies that sent forces to the gulf to protect neutral shipping have found dozens of mines, mainly in the northern and central sectors of the waterway, since July 1987. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said Iranian ships detected and destroyed four mines last year in the Gulf of <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> off the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> port of <PERSON> Khor </PERSON> <PERSON> Fakkan </PERSON>. Western naval officials believe the Iranians had planted the mines in the first place. At least eight ships, including the reflagged Kuwaiti tanker <LOCATION> Bridgeton </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missile frigate <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, have been sunk or damaged by mines in the last 16 months. Western officials said all were apparently laid by the Iranians. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officers estimate that as many as 200 mines, mainly contact-type devices moored to the seabed, are still in the gulf. Most are believed to be in shallow waters of the Iraqi coast in the northern end of the gulf. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is believed to have laid some, but most are believed to be Iranian. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s navy had four coastal and two inshore mine sweepers when the war broke out in September 1980, along with a squadron of six U.S.-built RH-53D mine helicopters. Western analysts believe that only two of the Iranian mine sweepers remain operational, while the two surviving RH-53D helicopters are no longer able to function as mine sweepers. In <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, `` Sacred Defense Week,'' organized to mark the eighth anniversary of the war, opened with a military parade in <LOCATION> Azadi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> reported. The Iranians and most military historians say the war began when the Iraqi army stormed across the border Sept. 22, 1980. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> says the conflict began Sept. 4, when the Iranians shelled border towns after weeks of skirmishing. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s President, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, reviewed the parade and declared, `` Although we have no practical war at the fronts ... yet we do not feel the enemy's threat any less than before,'' <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said. He called on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s forces to remain on alert because `` the enemy intends to again plot against this nation and the Islamic Revolution.'' He charged that the Iraqis were massing troops along the border and warned <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> against `` renewed aggression.'' <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION>, in a separate commentary, termed Sept. 22, 1980, `` the blackest day in contemporary history ... the day the army of pagandom launched a war against Islam ... the day the hordes of ignorance charged against the citadel of wisdom.''

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was pronounced disease-free today after undergoing a second medical examination before meeting the Discovery space shuttle astronauts at the Johnson Space Center in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. `` I'm fine,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> called out to reporters as he left Air Force One en route to a speaking engagement at <ORGANIZATION> Baylor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> before visiting the astronauts. As if to dramatize the opinion of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> physician, Dr. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohr </PERSON>, that he is free of disease, the president danced a little jig before entering his armored limousine. Spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters during the flight to <LOCATION> Waco </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was examined first on Tuesday as a precaution for his meeting with the astronauts, who are under a modified quarantine before their scheduled Sept. 29 launch. `` The main thing is to check for a cold or a virus that can be easily transmitted,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s senior aides and <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> detail were required to complete medical data forms before they were cleared to enter the space center with the president. Only <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will have direct contact with the five astronauts. `` We're all clean,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> quipped about the presidential staff.

<HEAD>Gandhi Withdraws Defamation Bill</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, Indian (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> on Thursday withdrew a defamation bill that journalists and opposition politicians charged was an attempt at censorship. `` We praise all good deeds by the government,'' said <PERSON> Prithvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Chakravarthy </PERSON>, an editor of the Calcutta-based, Bengali-language newspaper <PERSON> Aajkal </PERSON> and member of the Editor's Guild of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. `` This withdrawal is one of the few good acts committed by the government in a long time, and we welcome it.'' In a statement, <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> said he was withdrawing the bill because `` it has aroused misapprehensions and misgivigs'' among the press and public. The law would have expanded the concept of defamation and abolished any presumption of innocence by journalists or others making disclosures construed as defamatory. It permitted up to two years' imprisonment for first offenders and up to five years' imprisonment for subsequent convictions. The government had said the legislation would protect people from irresponsible journalism. Newspapers denounced it as `` fascist'' and `` undemocratic'' and said it was an attempt to muzzle the press after a year of reports of alleged kickbacks involving defense contracts. Prominent Indians, including some of <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s friends, have been accused of receiving millions of dollars to facilitate contracts for <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION> artillery guns and West German submarines. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> has denied receiving any money, and a government inquiry failed to note any wrongdoing. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> said the issue of defamation still must be resolved. `` The freedom and rights of the individual are ... sacred. It is this that makes the issue of defamation serious,'' his statement said. The defamation bill was passed by the lower house of Parliament on Aug. 30, but it still required a vote by the upper house.

 A combination of Southern antiques and artifacts from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> should provide a one-of-kind tourist attraction at an antebellum mansion, say its owners, a group of <PERSON> Hare </PERSON> <PERSON> Krishnas </PERSON> who have opened it to the public. The <ORGANIZATION> Old </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vedic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION>, which has about 20 members, recently acquired <ORGANIZATION> Gloucester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in this historic, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> city and hopes to make it a popular spot for visitors. `` We're still in the process of decorating and furnishing. But we went ahead and opened the house because it's so unique in itself. We could show it even if it were completely empty. It's in all the major picture books and is an example of one of the finest suburban villas in <LOCATION> Natchez </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Nico </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuyt </PERSON>, leader of the Church Hill-based group, said this week. <PERSON> Kuyt </PERSON> said that while the list price for the home was $ 1.25 million, the society paid only `` a fraction'' of that cost. `` It was a very reasonable price,'' he said. `` We financed the purchase, so now it's, ` We owe, we owe, it's off to work we go.''' <PERSON> Kuyt </PERSON> said tours of the pre-Civil War mansion will cost $ 4 per person. `` We have moved our cultural tour program about Vedic life down to <LOCATION> Gloucester </LOCATION>. That's on the second floor,'' he said. `` The first floor is a period house, with an 1820s dining room ... and an 1830s library.'' The parlor of the home is of the 1850-60 period. The society distributed brochures this week to welcome centers all over <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> to let people know the house is open for tours. `` <LOCATION> Gloucester </LOCATION> was on the <ORGANIZATION> Pilgrimage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Garden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> tour until about two years ago, when the last owner decided to take it off,'' <PERSON> Kuyt </PERSON> said. `` We're serious about tourism.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, counting down to their nationally televised debate on Sunday, swiped at each other three days early today from different parts of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. As <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> arrived in town to try and embarrass <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> by accepting the endorsement of a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> police union, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, was telling senior citizens at a separate gathering that the Democrats would `` stop the attack on Social Security and Medicare.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told the elderly people that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had once referred to Social Security as `` largely a welfare program'' and had cast the tie-breaking vote in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 on a bill `` to deny you a cost-of-living increase in your Social Security and to make you pay more for your medical benefits.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, meanwhile, was greeted by several hundred pro-Dukakis demonstrators when his motorcade pulled up at a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> restaurant where he was to receive the police endorsement. The protesters carried signs and chanted, `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> go home.'' Inside, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supporters chanted in return, `` We want <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'' and `` Dump the Duke,'' and one <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> backer who shouted out during the proceedings was ejected by police officers. `` My opponent is strongly out of the American mainstream on issues such as fighting crime,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice president, who was flanked by about three-dozen members of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrolman </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` Your endorsement is more than an endorsement of me; it's an endorsement of a philosophy. This is an enormous boost for me,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. The candidates were easing back their public schedules after today in order to prepare for the debate. The faceoff was just three days away, but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s top aide said today the two sides still had n't settled on who would ask the questions. `` The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign made a proposal that we use only network anchors for the panelists and the moderator _ three panelists and one moderator _ and we said we did n't think that would be appropriate because that would entirely foreclose print media participation,'' said campaign chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. He said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign had submitted a list of 14 names including print journalists and network correspondents as well as TV anchors. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in comments prepared for delivery at <ORGANIZATION> Baylor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, criticized Democrats _ implying <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> though not naming him _ as `` born-again <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Pattons </PERSON>'' in supporting strong military defense. While Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spent Wednesday engaging in a mock debate and in briefings with advisers, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> conferred with Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> on the Sunday night faceoff. The Democratic nominee, according to campaign sources, scheduled his own mock debate on Friday and planned to meet with two governors well-versed in the successes and pitfalls of public speaking _ <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> played down the endorsement by the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrolman </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, citing the association's `` history of supporting Republicans'' and the backing he has received from other law enforcement organizations, including the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Officers </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Combined </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s home state. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign plans to spend more than 60 percent of its $ 54 million budget on television advertising. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gearan </PERSON> said, `` I think we'll be competitive with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign, but beyond that we do n't detail our spending.'' Democratic vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was pitching the Democratic ticket's theme of `` good jobs at good wages'' in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Everett </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>. Republican vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was addressing the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> On Wednesday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> proposed his `` Healthy Start'' program, which would provide prenatal and post-partum care to pregnant women and children who are either uninsured or underinsured. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> met with two new mothers and their babies at <ORGANIZATION> Brigham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and said afterward, `` When the time came to stand up for our children's health care needs, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was nowhere to be found.'' The Democratic nominee spent the rest of the day preparing for the debate, even renting a meeting room in a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> hotel for practice sessions, said campaign sources who requested anonymity. The sources said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will hold a mock debate on Friday with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> standing in for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> played the same role in 1984 when <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> was preparing for her debate with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Negotiators for the two campaigns neared agreement on the heights of the lecterns for the debate at <ORGANIZATION> Wake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C </LOCATION>. The 6-foot-1 inch <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will stand at a 48-inch high lectern, according to a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> source who said the 5-foot-8 <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will use a 41-inch lectern and a riser. A new poll, meanwhile, found that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has gained in the race for the White House by solidifying his support among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents. The survey, conducted by Gallup for the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, showed that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has benefited from increased satisfaction with the course of the nation and confidence in the economy. The news was not all good for the Republican ticket, which received a bit of critical advice Wednesday from an unlikely source _ retired Sen. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON>. `` I want you to go back and tell <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to start talking about the issues, OK?'' the conservative and 1964 <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nominee told <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> after introducing him to a <ORGANIZATION> Rotary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> luncheon in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> accused three Czechoslovak diplomats Thursday of spying and ordered them to leave the country within two weeks. A Foreign Office announcement said the three envoys, including two military attaches, `` engaged in activities incompatible with their status'' _ diplomatic parlance for espionage. The diplomats are Maj. <PERSON> Bedrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramar </PERSON>, the assistant military and air attache; Maj. <PERSON> Vlastmil </PERSON> <PERSON> Netolicky </PERSON>, a member of the military attache's staff, and <PERSON> Paval </PERSON> <PERSON> Moudry </PERSON>, a member of the commercial section. The expulsions prompted speculation the envoys were linked with a London-based art dealer, <PERSON> Erwin </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Haarlem </PERSON>, who says he is Czechoslovakian and who is awaiting trial on charges of preparing to set up a spy ring. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> also has complained this year about supplies of Czechoslovak-made explosives reaching the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which is waging a bombing and shooting campaign to drive the British from <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> refused to elaborate on its terse announcement. At the <ORGANIZATION> Czechoslovak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, a telephone receptionist told reporters after the 12:45 p.m. announcement that the embassy was closed for lunch and said later it was closed for the day. In <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Czechoslovak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dusan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rovensky </PERSON> said he had no comment. Czechoslovak Ambassador <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fidler </PERSON> was summoned to the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday morning and given the expulsion order. `` The Foreign Secretary -LRB- Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> -RRB- wishes it to be clearly understood that, while we wish to build up our relations with <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, we are not prepared to relax our policy on the sort of activities in which Maj. <PERSON> Kramar </PERSON>, Maj. <PERSON> Netolicky </PERSON> and Mr. <PERSON> Moudry </PERSON> have engaged,'' the statement said. <PERSON> Kramar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Moudry </PERSON> have been in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> since 1984, and <PERSON> Netolicky </PERSON> arrived in September 1985, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said. They brought to seven the number of Czechoslovak diplomats <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has expelled since 1983, usually amid speculation the envoys were suspected of spying on behalf of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` There are certain instances, for example, where the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- the Soviet secret police -RRB- or the <ORGANIZATION> GRU </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Soviet military intelligence -RRB- has not wanted to get directly involved and has used Czech intelligence to do so,'' <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, a defense analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Emmanuel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, said in a radio interview Thursday. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Haarlem </PERSON>, who has a Dutch passport, was arrested last April at his <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> apartment. Police burst in and said they caught him using radio equipment to transmit signals `` to a foreign power.'' He has been indicted for trial at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Old </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bailey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. No date has been set. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> last expelled Soviet diplomats in September 1985. A total of 31 Soviets and 31 Britons, including businessmen and journalists, were ordered out of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in a series of retaliatory expulsions. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has expelled four other diplomats in the past month: a Tunisian who refused to pay hundreds of dollars of parking fines, a Vietnamese who brandished a gun at demonstrators, a Cuban who fired a gun in a street, and the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> ambassador.

 A tearful woman, clutching a stuffed animal, broke down on the witness stand today after testifying that she was raped and sodomized by a group of men. `` I was screaming and telling him to stop. ... He was holding my legs. I was trying to push him off,'' the 19-year-old woman said of defendant <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, 23, the first to be tried of the 10 men indicted in the case. She said <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> was laughing as he raped her on the hood of a car, and that other men nearby joined in and also sexually assaulted her. After she had testified for about one hour, the court recessed when the woman, in tears, said she was about to faint. On Wednesday, the doctor who examined the woman said she was scratched and bruised, including internal bruises, when she arrived at a hospital for treatment. `` She told me she had been sexually assaulted by as many as 20 to 23 men,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Vilma </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, who examined her at <ORGANIZATION> Humana </ORGANIZATION> Hospital-Corpus Christi on March 27. The woman said `` that they were her neighbors,'' <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> testified Wednesday in the sexual assault trial. Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON> said he expected the woman to continue her testimony later today. The woman, who was a resident of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> at the time, told authorities she was kidnapped and sexually assaulted by the men over a period of several hours on the night of March 26-27. All 10 have pleaded innocent to charges including kidnapping, aggravated kidnapping and sexual assault. `` This was not a kidnapping,'' defense attorney <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> said in an interview Wednesday. `` She voluntarily went.'' <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Briones </PERSON> testified Wednesday that the woman scratched her attackers, cried out for help and fainted while she was being raped on the hood of a car outside town. <PERSON> Briones </PERSON>, 29, said the woman cried: `` Help me, please help me.'' `` She was moaning and groaning. She had tears in her eyes,'' <PERSON> Briones </PERSON> said in Spanish through an interpreter. `` I was the only one who told them to leave her alone,'' said <PERSON> Briones </PERSON>, who also faces a sexual assault charge in the case. Prosecutors have promised to recommend probation for <PERSON> Briones </PERSON> in exchange for his testimony. <PERSON> Briones </PERSON> says he was impotent at the time of the attack from drinking too much beer. When <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> asked him if the woman was making sounds of pleasure, <PERSON> Briones </PERSON> answered: `` It was nothing about being happy.'' He said <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> held the woman's wrists during part of the attack. `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> -RRB- told me to hold her because she was scratching him,'' <PERSON> Briones </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Briones </PERSON> said he saw several of the other defendants assaulting the woman. Sexual assault is punishable by two to 20 years in prison and-or a fine of up to $ 10,000. The woman, her husband and two children have moved to an undisclosed location in another city because of reported harassment since she accused the 10 men.

<HEAD>American School Children Perform Poorly In Science Education,
Study Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Science literacy among <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s school children is at an `` alarming and depressing'' level that may prevent many high school graduates from doing well in skilled jobs or college-level course, according to a study released Thursday. `` The Science Report Card,'' a federally funded project conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Testing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, found that more than half of the nation's 17-year-olds are so poorly educated in science that they can not benefit from special job training and can not perform work requiring basic technical understanding. Only seven percent of the 17-year-olds in the study demonstrated sufficient skills to do well in college-level science courses. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION>, called the findings `` depressing and alarming,'' and said the poor level of science education could be `` disastrous'' for the country. The science report card reflects data collected in 1986. It is the fifth national study of science skills among 9 -, 13 - and 17-year-olds to be conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> since Among the findings: _ Science achievement remains well below the results of the 1969 study for students at age 17, although there was a slight upturn observed in the 1982 and 1986 surveys _ Declines in science achievement are less for pupils aged 9 and 13, but the average achievement at age 13 remains below that measured in 1970, and achievement at age 9 has only now returned to the level measured in 1970 _ Science proficiency for black and hispanic students aged 13 and 17 remains at least four years behind the levels of white students of the same ages A marked difference in science proficiency is measured between girls and boys at the 13 and 17 age levels, although the genders measure approximately the same at age 9. At age 17, half of the males demonstrate an ability to analyze scientific procedures and data, while only a third of the females have such skills. In the study of physics, the study said, the gender gap is `` extremely large'' by the 11th grade. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said the findings `` paint a stark picture of science education in our nation's schools.'' `` Scientific understanding is more and more a prerequisite for informed citizenship,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON>. `` If <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s citizens of tomorrow are not scientifically literate, we place our very democracy at risk.'' She said that the lower level of science achievement by females and minority students is the most disturbing of the findings. `` By many measures of science proficiency, the inequalities for both minorities and females actually increase as students move through the grades,'' she said. <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON>, in a statement released by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION>, said the findings could be troubling for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s future. `` When only a small number of our students can understand basic scientific concepts, the results are disastrous for the entire country,'' he said. `` Here we are, one of the great scientific giants of the world, and almost 60 percent of our successful 17-year-olds do n't have the scientific literacy required of informed citizens.'' The Science Report Card reinforces results of an international study released earlier this year that showed American school children at all levels performed far behind children of the same age in most of the other 14 nations surveyed. The Science Report Card study is financed by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> as part of a program called the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assessment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progress </ORGANIZATION>.

 Aspiring movie stars thought they would see ghosts outside a trendy concert hall and restaurant, but instead they saw red when they learned they were the victims of a hoax. More than 100 people showed up Wednesday at the Hard Rock Cafe in answer to an erroneous call for 2,000 extras to help shoot a scene for `` Ghostbusters II.'' `` Who they gon na call? Extras!'' read a newspaper and radio appeal. `` Ghostbusters director <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Reitman </PERSON> said he and his crew will shoot a scene for the sequel to the hit movie at noon Wednesday in front of the Hard Rock Cafe on <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> Avenue in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>.'' And so a crowd gathered around the restaurant, a large converted church just north of downtown. `` It was a little confusing at first; we were n't really sure what was going on,'' said <LOCATION> Hard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> cafe manager <PERSON> Colston </PERSON> <PERSON> Burgher </PERSON>. `` They were standing out in the street. Some of them came in. They said they had heard on the radio that there was a need for extras to film the movie. I really do n't know where the story came from.'' The story, which turned out to be a hoax, said that <PERSON> Reitman </PERSON> needed 2,000 extras for the shoot and asked that `` people planning to attend not wear ` outrageous clothes.''' The would-be extras said they had heard the appeal on four area radio stations. `` Yes, we did it, but we corrected it,'' said <PERSON> Clint </PERSON> <PERSON> Culp </PERSON>, manager at one of the radio stations, KTXQ. `` It was a well-placed hoax.'' `` Ghostbusters II'' producer <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Gross </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reitman </PERSON> has n't started shooting the movie yet He said it was not known who was behind the hoax.

<TEXT>
 Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> raided <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' home turf today to accept the endorsement of a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> police union and declared the support would give his campaign `` an enormous boost. `` Who was it who said the police are n't there when you need them?'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` They're wrong.'' The vice president, flanked at a restaurant by about three-dozen members of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrolman </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, accepted the endorsement voted the day before by the 1,500-member union. His motorcade was met outside by several hundred pro-Dukakis demonstrators chanting `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> go home'' and `` Where was <PERSON> George </PERSON>?'' Inside <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s supporters had their own chants of `` We want <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'' and `` Dump the Duke.'' And one <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> backer who _ when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> began talking about war on crime _ shouted `` War on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>,'' was ejected from the room by police officers. In brief remarks, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I'm here not only to accept this endorsement but to make it clear I'm the one in this race who wants to strengthen law enforcement.'' `` My opponent is strongly out of the American mainstream on issues such as fighting crime,'' the vice president said. `` Your endorsement is more than an endorsement of me; it's an endorsement of a philosophy. This is an enormous boost for me.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Guiney </PERSON>, president of the association, said, `` As police officers in the capital city of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, we know Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> well and we can state publicly he is no friend of police.'' The vice president, who is limiting public appearances this week to prepare for Sunday's presidential debate, spent Wednesday in briefings with advisers and engaged in a mock debate. While aides are working out final logistical details on the Sunday debate, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was taking a break from his preparations today for the trip to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and an appearance with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> visit is the second this month for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. He previously toured <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> and claimed the Democratic nominee did little to clean up the heavy pollution in the harbor. Police union officials, citing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' opposition to the death penalty and his support for a former program granting weekend furloughs for convicted felons, said they supported <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> because he would be more attentive to law enforcement needs. They also said they were angry the governor had failed to attend the funerals recently of three police officers killed on duty. `` The police officers in this city are upset with the governor and his policies,'' said <PERSON> Guiney </PERSON>. `` There's a feeling we are taken for granted.'' Republican leaders were elated and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> telephoned his thanks to several of the union officers. `` This sends a message to the whole country that the law enforcement agency that knows <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> best does n't want him to become president,'' said <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Tennant </PERSON>, executive director of the state <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> downplayed the endorsement, citing the association's `` history of supporting Republicans,'' including <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1980 and 1984 <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he has received backing from other law enforcement organizations, including the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Officers </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Combined </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s home state.

<HEAD>Woman Pleads Guilty Eight Years Later</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A woman accused of seducing her lover into killing her husband has been sentenced to five to 18 years in prison after the long-time fugitive pleaded guilty to second-degree murder. <PERSON> Naomi </PERSON> <PERSON> Cloud </PERSON>, 45, entered her plea Wednesday in the 1980 shooting death of her husband, 54-year-old <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Cloud </PERSON>, who was shot outside their <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> home when the couple returned from a party. She had been charged with first-degree murder and faced a possible life sentence. <LOCATION> Fayette </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Circuit Judge <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zane </PERSON> <PERSON> Summerfield </PERSON> said Mrs. Cloud did not confess during her court appearance. `` She simply insisted on her constitutional right to enter a guilty plea rather than run the risk of a jury trial and conviction on a charge of first-degree murder,'' <PERSON> Summerfield </PERSON> said. Her trial had been scheduled to start Monday. The trial had been moved to <LOCATION> Fayette </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Mercer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> because of pretrial publicity. Authorities allege Mrs. Cloud lured her boyfriend at the time, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Corprew </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Roanoke </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, into the plot to kill her husband, and <PERSON> Corprew </PERSON> in turn paid <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON> II of <LOCATION> Roanoke </LOCATION> $ 2,500 to be the triggerman. <PERSON> Corprew </PERSON> pleaded guilty to a charge that he arranged the killing, and <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON> twice was convicted of being the triggerman. Prosecutors portrayed Mrs. Cloud as a temptress. <PERSON> Corprew </PERSON> testified he was Mrs. Cloud's lover and that she was `` a spider and I was caught in her web. I could n't get out.'' Mrs. Cloud jumped bail and fled the state in 1982 just before she was to stand trial. She was recaptured April 21 in <LOCATION> Kennewick </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, after authorities received a tip. She has been held in the <LOCATION> Fayette </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION> without bond since her return to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. Mrs. Cloud contended that her husband was murdered by a masked assailant who emerged from the darkness outside their home and demanded money, then fired one shotgun blast. <LOCATION> Mercer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Prosecutor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> questioned why the man had n't robbed the house while the Clouds were at the dinner party, why Mrs. Cloud's life was spared, and why the assailant took no valuables. <PERSON> Corprew </PERSON> was sentenced to five years in prison after pleading guilty to voluntary manslaughter. <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON> is serving a life sentence for first-degree murder.

<TEXT>
 Crown Prince <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> assumed all his father's duties Thursday while 87-year-old Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, bedridden with a serious illness, ate two ice cubes and watched sumo wrestling on television More than 23,000 people, many in suits or kimonos, took up calligraphy brushes and inked their names on registries set up in 12 sites around the country to wish a speedy recovery to the world's longest reigning living monarch. Chartered buses began bringing hundreds of pilgrims to the gates of the Imperial Palace in central <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, and priests at Shinto shrines and <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> temples across the country continued their prayer services. Crowds have gathered in front of the palace since <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> took to bed with intestinal hemorrhaging four days ago. Palace officials said Thursday he remained in serious but stable condition. Palace officials said he was receiving oxygen and intravenous dosages of nutrients and medicine and was under intensive, round-the-clock care. `` We are continuing to regard the situation seriously,'' one palace official said on condition of anonymity. He said the emperor's condition has not changed significantly. The Japanese government meanwhile protested to two British tabloid newspapers for their strongly negative coverage of <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>. A recent headline in the Daily Star read, `` Sun Sets on the God King,'' while the Sun announced: `` Hell's Waiting for This Truly Evil Emperor.'' Also Thursday, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s finance minister announced he would not attend a series of international monetary meetings scheduled to begin in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> this week due to the emperor's illness. Finance Minister <PERSON> Kiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> was scheduled to leave Friday afternoon for meetings with the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. He also was to participate in a meeting of the Group of Seven: the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> will be represented by <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> Governor <PERSON> Satoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sumita </PERSON>. Palace officials confirmed Thursday that the emperor had eaten two small ice cubes and had been transferred to a special bed making medical treatment easier. News reports said he watched television, including a broadcast of sumo wrestling. The Cabinet temporarily passed the imperial mantle to <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON>. The 54-year-old crown prince assumed part of his father's duties last September when <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> underwent an intestinal bypass operation. `` Taking into consideration the emperor's illness and medical treatment, we have asked the crown prince to temporarily assume responsibilities,'' Chief Cabinet Secretary <PERSON> Keizo </PERSON> <PERSON> Obuchi </PERSON> said. The duties include placing an official seal on government appointments and new laws, convocation of parliament and various ceremonial functions. It was not known whether the crown prince carried out any of his duties Thursday, but news reports said he was expected to sign several Cabinet orders on industrial policy on Friday or Monday. Under the Constitution, the emperor has no real power, but he signs documents already approved by the government and serves as a symbol of unity for the Japanese people. The <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Household </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> came under fire for providing only sketchy reports on the health of the emperor. `` Within allowable limits, they should as much as possible give careful reports,'' chief government spokesman <PERSON> Keizo </PERSON> <PERSON> Obuchi </PERSON> said at a news conference. <PERSON> Obuchi </PERSON>'s remarks followed a report in the nationally circulated <ORGANIZATION> Mainichi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> newspaper that the agency's failure to disclose sufficient information on the emperor's health led to conflicting reports and was reminiscent of the agency's tight-lipped policy during the reign of <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s father, the <ORGANIZATION> Taisho </ORGANIZATION> emperor, who died on Christmas Day 1926. The <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Household </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> is the notoriously conservative guardian of the monarchy's affairs. News briefings on <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s condition last only a few minutes and invariably exclude foreigners, although officials answer telephoned queries from foreign news agencies Officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said they were pressing the palace to deliver fuller reports. Most other Cabinet ministers canceled plans to leave <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, including Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sosuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>, who was to leave Thursday for talks with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> leaders in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The government has asked Italian Prime Minister <PERSON> Ciriaco </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON> to postpone state visits to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> this month.

 <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> has backed down in its quest for near-total control over <ORGANIZATION> Chelsea </ORGANIZATION>'s schools by agreeing to let the city's <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> retain some power. <ORGANIZATION> BU </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to modify its proposal for a contract to manage the troubled 3,300-student <ORGANIZATION> Chelsea </ORGANIZATION> system came after failing to win a 10-year management pact this summer. The university agreed Wednesday night that committee members could override any of their management decisions by a two-thirds majority. `` This is our best shot,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Greer </PERSON>, dean of <ORGANIZATION> BU </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> But some School Committee members were still reluctant to enter into a contract with the university. Some felt rushed by the university's push for a vote. `` You expect us to do all this in a week?'' committee member <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> McBride </PERSON> said after hearing the proposal. `` I think it's a little much.'' <PERSON> Chelsea </PERSON>, which is near bankruptcy, has had problems running its schools efficiently. It also has had trouble raising the average of students' standardized test scores, which are lower than the state average. Under <ORGANIZATION> BU </ORGANIZATION>'s latest proposal, the university would take over all aspects of the school system, including negotiating union contracts, hiring, setting curriculum and developing educational policy. It allows parents and community leaders to serve on two advisory boards established to aid university representatives, but the primary governing body would be a BU-controlled board. <ORGANIZATION> BU </ORGANIZATION> and the committee would have the right to terminate the contract. If the committee agrees to the <ORGANIZATION> BU </ORGANIZATION> proposal, it must be approved by the city's Board of Aldermen and the state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>.

 A Vietnamese refugee who battled liver cancer for nine months got his last wish to see his family emigrate safely from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> before he died. Ton <PERSON> Anh </PERSON> <PERSON> Huynh </PERSON>, 25, had clung to life, hoping for a reunion with the family he had left behind when he fled <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> with his father and brother in 1979. He died Wednesday at the Summit Medical Center in <LOCATION> Frisco </LOCATION>, just a week after his mother, two other brothers and two sisters arrived in Dillon from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. `` I think he kind of held on until the family came. That was all,'' said <PERSON> Long </PERSON> <PERSON> Anh </PERSON> <PERSON> Huynh </PERSON>, the brother who left <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Huynh </PERSON>. `` He was really ill and was getting weaker every day.'' `` He was very happy and he was still pretty good. He could still talk and was very happy,'' Long <PERSON> Anh </PERSON> <PERSON> Huynh </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Huynh </PERSON>'s mother had not been told of her son's illness until she arrived in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. She `` was very upset, but I told her there's not much we can do,'' Long <PERSON> Anh </PERSON> <PERSON> Huynh </PERSON> said. The family spent a `` very good week'' together in the house that Ton's father bought just two weeks ago, he said. Long <PERSON> Anh </PERSON> <PERSON> Huynh </PERSON> said that when his brother's condition worsened Tuesday night, the family took him to Summit Medical Center. <PERSON> Huynh </PERSON>'s illness had spurred a long effort by a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> restaurateur in <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Tournier </PERSON>, to reunite his family. <PERSON> Tournier </PERSON> had sponsored <PERSON> Huynh </PERSON> and his father as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens, gave them a place to live and taught them the restaurant business.

 Fire broke out on a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> drilling rig Thursday near the site of history's worst oil disaster, and one man was reported missing, officials said. The <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> said 66 of the 67 workers aboard the rig were rescued. One of the rescued men suffered minor injuries during the incident aboard the Ocean Odyssey rig, 138 miles east of <LOCATION> Aberdeen </LOCATION>, officials said. The cause of the blaze was not immediately known. The rig is operated by the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Richfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` The survivors were rescued by helicopter and have been put on two oil rig supply vessels ... which will take them to <ORGANIZATION> Aberdeen </ORGANIZATION>,'' a <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said on condition of anonymity. Energy Minister <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> ordered a full investigation into the fire, which occurred 110 miles southeast of the <LOCATION> Piper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alpha </LOCATION> platform where 167 men died July 6. The energy department said the Ocean Odyssey, which began operating at the beginning of this year, passed a safety inspection last week. The <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> disaster prompted calls for review of safety procedures in the industry, and the government has recommended additional safety measures on all oil and gas rigs. <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffey </PERSON>, a spokesman at a base at <LOCATION> Pitreavie </LOCATION>, stressed that the Ocean Odyssey incident was not `` anything like the <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION>.'' He also denied reports of an explosion. `` The word explosion has never been used from anybody on the scene, in the air, or from surface vessels in the vicinity,'' he said. The domestic news agency <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> reported a `` blow-out'' when `` a huge carpet of gas was hit unexpectedly,'' causing fires on both deck and sea levels. A spokesman for <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Richfield </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he could not comment on the cause of the blaze but reported `` an apparent gas flow at the surface.'' Reports varied on how many vessels took part in the rescue, but <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Flight Lt. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Tonkin </PERSON>, at a base at <LOCATION> Kinloss </LOCATION>, said five helicopters, an air force reconnaisance aircraft and the two supply vessels were involved. <PERSON> Coffey </PERSON> said the British warship, the HMS Illustrious, diverted to the area as it returned from a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> operation off the coast of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> and sent two rescue helicopters ahead to help with the search. The incident occurred as <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION>, the operators of the Piper platform, prepared to lift parts of the sunken platform from the seabed. Three-quarters of the platform sank in the explosions and fire that wrecked the rig, and most of the 113 bodies still missing were thought to be trapped inside the sunken living quarters. <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> plans to salvage two living quarters, one of which is about the size of a four-story building, and open them in shallow water off the coast of <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. The company expects the lifting to begin Friday or Saturday.

 A fourth anti-apartheid activist escaped detention and took refuge in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consulate </ORGANIZATION>, where three other activists have been holed up for 10 days, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spokesman said today. Police issued an arrest warrant for <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> Ngcobo </PERSON>, who fled Wednesday while being treated at <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> and went to the American consulate on the 11th floor of a downtown <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> office tower. Authorities later said the warrant had been suspended. <PERSON> Ngcobo </PERSON> claims he was assaulted by police the night he was detained. The consulate, which has been providing refuge to three other activists who escaped last week, decided to allow <PERSON> Ngcobo </PERSON> to remain, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Zavis </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>. All four detainees escaped guards while undergoing physiotherapy treatment at <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. Black activist <PERSON> Winnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> visited the consultate Wednesday and complained <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials would not let the detainees make direct contact with reporters. The 30-year-old <PERSON> Ngcobo </PERSON>, active in the anti-apartheid <ORGANIZATION> Soweto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, had been held five months, said attorneys at the <LOCATION> Cheadle </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> law firm that represents <PERSON> Ngcobo </PERSON>. An affidavit has been filed in which <PERSON> Ngcobo </PERSON> alleges he was assaulted by police the night of his detention, the attorneys said. At the recommendation of a doctor, <PERSON> Ngcobo </PERSON> was hospitalized four days after he was detained, the lawyers added. <PERSON> Zavis </PERSON> said he could give no details of the escape nor whether American diplomats had contacted the South African government about the newcomer. There was no immediate comment from government officials. `` The South African Police considers -LRB- <PERSON> Ngcobo </PERSON> -RRB- as an ordinary accused in a criminal case, and he will be treated in accordance with normal legal procedure,'' police said. Police have not accused <PERSON> Ngcobo </PERSON> of any crime but said they were investigating charges of illegal possession of weapons and intimidation. Two leaders of the banned <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the country's largest multiracial anti-apartheid alliance, and another activist have been inside the consulate since Sept. 13 The three, two black men and an ethnic Indian, have issued statements demanding release of all political detainees and have refused to leave the consulate despite a promise from the white minority government that they will not be arrested again or restricted. They have given no indication how long they plan to stay. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say the activists will not be expelled from the consulate, despite a worldwide <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy of refusing asylum in its diplomatic missions. Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, wife of jailed black nationalist leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, visited the activists Wednesday before <PERSON> Ngcobo </PERSON> arrived. Under apartheid, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 26 million blacks have no say in national affairs. In another development, police placed restrictions on three black activists with the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> African Trade Unions, the country's largest black labor federation. The three were to take part in a national anti-apartheid unity conference this weekend in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. The police orders prohibit the trio from leaving their home towns and require they remain in their residences from dusk to dawn through Oct. 3. Also, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> said police detained two of their officials Wednesday. Eleven others expected to participate in the conference were detained Wednesday. About 30,000 people have been detained for varying lengths under the 27-month state of emergency. The government declared the emergency in an effort to end black protests against apartheid.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> hit the campaign trail for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today with ridicule for `` born-again Gen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Pattons </PERSON>'' in the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> who say they support a strong national defense. Without mentioning the name of <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the president told a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> `` Texas Victory'88'' rally that liberal Democrats have had `` a deathbed conversion'' to <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> positions supporting the submarine-based Trident missile and the Stealth bomber. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was interrupted repeatedly by deafening screams and applause from about 9,000 <ORGANIZATION> Baylor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students who hissed at the president's frequent mention of liberal Democrats. Signs on the wall read `` Rock ` Em Ron'' and `` Push For <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' `` When the liberals say ` family,' they mean ` big brother in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.' When we say ` family' we mean ` honor thy father and mother','' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. The crowd went wild. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> declared that under his and the vice president's leadership, `` our nation is again respected in the world, our armed forces are strong and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is at peace. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was stumping for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Beau </PERSON> <PERSON> Boulter </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, who is seeking the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat of <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, before joining the vice president at fund-raising dinner in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> tonight. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he recently vetoed a $ 299.5 billion defense authorization bill because he was convinced it would have harmed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military strength. He then invoked the name of Gen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Patton </PERSON>, a crusty and venerable World War II combat hero, in lambasting the Democratic ticket. `` But lately, some liberal leaders have seen what was happening to them in the polls and had a deathbed conversion,'' he said. `` They'd have you believe that they're born-again Gen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Pattons </PERSON>. But if we go the way they want to go, our defenses will run out of gas in no time.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has charged repeatedly that his Democratic rival, the governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, was soft on defense issues and would weaken the national security. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has said he opposes the rail-based MX missile and has voiced concerns about how far the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should go in deploying B-1 bombers. But in an effort to deflect the vice president's criticism, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> donned a military helmet and took a ride in an M-1 battle tank last week at a defense contractor's plant in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> to underscore his argument that he believes in a strong military. The president said that when <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> liberals talk of supporting new weapons systems, `` they whisper that they're also for delaying deployment of both systems -LRB- the Trident and the Stealth bomber -RRB- pending the outcome of arms talks, which could drag on for years, while the Soviets could be deploying new systems of their own.'' Said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>: `` They shout loudly that the're for maintaining the effectiveness of the land-based leg of our strategic -LRB- missile -RRB- triad. But they're against the modern missile systems that will be available for years to come and would like to see an end to the flight testing needed to develop new systems.'' On Wednesday, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> offered <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> some advice on the vice president's first nationally televised debate with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on Sunday in <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C </LOCATION>. The president told reporters he advised <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to `` take no prisoners'' in the face-off at <ORGANIZATION> Wake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. During today's trip, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also planned to visit the Johnson Space Center in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, where he was to meet with the five Discovery space shuttle astronauts who are preparing for a Sept. 29 launch. His joint appearance with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is their second since the vice president won the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nomination in mid-August. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, with its 29 electoral votes and status as <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s home state, is a pivotal campaign battleground for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. After <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> tapped <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> as his running mate, the senator was allowed to remain on the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> ballot in his bid for a fourth <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> term under the so-called `` Lyndon Law,'' which was passed to allow <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> to run simultaneously for re-election to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and for the vice presidency with <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> in 1960. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s last visit to the space center was a grim one, coming only days after the disastrous explosion of the Challenger space shuttle on Jan. 28, 1986. The Challenger's seven crew members perished when their spacecraft erupted in a giant fireball only 73 seconds after liftoff. At the time, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> mourned the loss of `` our seven star voyagers'' and pledged that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> would forge ahead with an effective and safe space program. The president also said Wednesday that he supported <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s criticism of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for vetoing a 1977 bill in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> that would have required public school teachers to lead students in reciting the Pledge of Allegiance <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has cited an advisory opinion of the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> that the bill was unconstitutional. `` I've seen many children today who do n't know what they're supposed to do when the national anthem is played or when the flag goes by,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told reporters `` I remember that I learned all that in school. Why should n't they?'' The president was asked whether teachers should be forced to lead students in the pledge. `` That's what they're there for,'' he shot back. `` Their job is to teach something.''

<HEAD>Police Continue Crackdown But Withdraw Warrant For Fourth Escaped
Detainee</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police continued a nationwide crackdown on government opponents Thursday, but they backtracked on a detainee who escaped and joined three other activists holed up at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Consulate. Police issued, then withdrew an arrest warrant for <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> Ngcobo </PERSON>, who escaped Wednesday while being treated at a hospital and fled to the 11th-floor consulate in a downtown <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> office building. Consular officials, who have provided refuge for three prominent activists since their escape Sept. 13, allowed <PERSON> Ngcobo </PERSON> to remain while his case is assessed, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Zavis </PERSON> said. Police have pledged not to arrest the three initial escapees if they leave the consulate, but Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> said a multipronged crackdown against other activists is under way. Across the country this week, more than two dozen activists have been detained or barred from political activities, offices of anti-apartheid groups have been raided, and pedestrians and motorists in urban centers have been subjected to random searches. The crackdown comes during an increase in bombings, including five in a nine-hour span late Wednesday and early Thursday. Authorities said 38 people were injured, including 18 whites at a <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> bus terminal and 19 blacks eight hours later at a disco on the other side of the city. The owner of the disco said three white men entered, then left without drinking any of the beers they had ordered, shortly before the explosion. Police blame most recent bombings on the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the major guerrilla group fighting white-minority rule. But activists believe right-wing vigilantes or a covert security force unit carried out the recent bombing of a <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> building used by anti-apartheid groups. <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> said the security crackdown was intended to counter an alleged campaign to disrupt nationwide municipal elections next month. Activists advocate a boycott of the elections and say the segregated black council seats at stake are components of a white-controlled system that excludes blacks from central government. Police also have been targeting activists expected to participate in a national anti-apartheid conference this weekend in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. The main sponsor of the conference, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> African Trade Unions, said Thursday that eight of its members were detained and four barred from leaving the <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> area. <PERSON> Ngcobo </PERSON>, 30, was active in the anti-apartheid <ORGANIZATION> Soweto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and had been held since April 23, his attorneys said. <PERSON> Ngcobo </PERSON> alleged that he was assaulted by police on the night of his detention, and he was hospitalized four days after he was detained, the attorneys said. Police issued an arrest warrant for <PERSON> Ngcobo </PERSON> on Thursday and said he was wanted for illegal weapons possession and intimidation, but several hours later the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the warrant was suspended. The department said the case against <PERSON> Ngcobo </PERSON> dealt only with weapons possession, not with any other alleged offense, and was referred to the attorney general for consideration. Authorities did not elaborate on what would happen to <PERSON> Ngcobo </PERSON> if he left his refuge. The government has said it will act against the three activists who escaped to the consulate last week. They are <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> <PERSON> Morobe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Valli </PERSON> <PERSON> Moosa </PERSON>, leaders of the banned <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, the country's largest anti-apartheid coalition, and <PERSON> Vusi </PERSON> <PERSON> Khanyile </PERSON>, chairman of the banned <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crisis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The three eluded guards while receiving physiotherapy at <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, the same facility that <PERSON> Ngcobo </PERSON> escaped from. The three have called for the release of all political detainees and have refused to leave the consulate despite the government assurances. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say the activists will not be expelled from the consulate despite a worldwide policy of not granting asylum in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomatic missions. By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

 Voters' doubts about <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> are such that, despite <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s recent strength in the presidential race, the debates between the two men will prove critical, analysts of a new poll suggested Thursday. `` We consider this contest still a very close one,'' said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohut </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Gallup </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which conducted the poll for the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The poll suggested that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has gained in the presidential race more by solidifying his support among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents than by siphoning off Democrats from <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` He has performed in a way that has caused Republicans to come home,'' analyst <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Ornstein </PERSON> said at a news conference where the poll results were released. <PERSON> Kohut </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` has won the first round of this campaign and seized the momentum,'' but that support for both men was `` soft,'' with many people who expressed a preference saying they might switch to the opponent. <PERSON> Ornstein </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was vulnerable on the Iran-Contra affair and on the administration's handling of drug charges against <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, with the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> question `` more significant to people'' than any other issue <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s criticism of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' prison furlough program `` resounds with more voters than any other charges'' against the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, <PERSON> Ornstein </PERSON> said. Voters are also sensitive to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' veto of a bill that would have required the Pledge of Allegiance in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> schools, not because it raises questions about <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' patriotism, but because the public thinks his judgment was wrong, <PERSON> Kohut </PERSON> said. The poll analysis called <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate, Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, `` the achilles heel of the Republicans'' because of doubts about his qualifications. While <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> did not appear to be an issue on which votes were swinging directly, <PERSON> Ornstein </PERSON> said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> would be `` more of an issue than the overall numbers suggest'' as `` a symbol of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s judgment combined with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and Iran-Contra.'' `` Given the doubts ... whether either candidate has the judgment to be a good president ... these debates are either going to reinforce doubts or erase doubts about their judgment,'' <PERSON> Ornstein </PERSON> said. `` I think the debates are critical.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> have their first debate Sunday in <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, their second on Oct. 13 or 14 in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The poll suggested that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has advanced his cause by painting <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as ideologically out of step, and he has benefited from increased voter satisfaction with the nation's course and confidence in the economy. But while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has drawn some conservative Democrats to his side, he has lost ground among other Democratic-oriented groups, said Gallup's analysis. It said the more significant movement was <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s greater support from Republicans in general, and particularly from Republican-leaning, blue-collar conservatives identified in the survey as `` disaffected'' voters. `` For all the talk of the importance of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> <PERSON> Democrats </PERSON>, this analysis suggests that the most significant dynamic in recent weeks has been the return of Republicans to the fold _ with disaffecteds showing the largest proportionate swing,'' Gallup's analysis said The `` disaffecteds,'' set apart by their suspicion of government, made up about a tenth of the registered voters in the poll. They went from a nearly even division on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in May to backing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by 61 percent to 27 percent this month, <PERSON> Gallup </PERSON> said. The poll defines the electorate by grouping voters with shared values, rather than through the more traditional measures of political party identification or ideology. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has made inroads only in the most conservative Democratic groups, <PERSON> Kohut </PERSON> said, and he lost ground among another Democratic group, `` seculars,'' who are non-religious and put an emphasis on personal freedom. A pro-Dukakis group, the liberal ``'60s Democrats,'' supports <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> more strongly now, apparently in reaction to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s ideologically based attacks At the same time, core Republican groups support <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> almost unanimously, and in each `` there has been a dramatic increase in the proportion who say they support <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> strongly,'' Gallup's analysis said As a result, it said, `` It is clear that the main effect of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> efforts has been to solidify his base among Republican-oriented groups.'' Overall, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was supported by 50 percent in the poll of 2,001 registered voters to 44 percent for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The survey, done Sept. 9-14, had a margin of error of three percentage points, so <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s lead was not statistically meaningful But, in this as in other polls, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had trailed badly before the Republican convention in August.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> McCrery </PERSON> got the backing of Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> when he ran for <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>'s former congressional seat, but now that he's seeking re-election his major opponent is <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>'s mother. <PERSON> Adeline </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> says she entered the race because she's disappointed with the incumbent's brief performance in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> McCrery </PERSON>, a Republican who formerly worked as a top aide to <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> when <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> was congressman, called the challenge in the Oct. 1 open primary `` quite awkward and quite uncomfortable,'' but said he's confident of winning his first full two-year term. <PERSON> McCrery </PERSON> won a runoff in April to fill the rest of <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>'s unexpired term <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>, a Democrat who was elected four times to the 4th District seat, took office as governor on March 15. `` I voted for <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> McCrery </PERSON> in the runoff,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>, 64, a Democrat. `` While I felt there were two good people in the runoff, I felt I knew <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> better. ... I thought he would vote across party lines in the best interests of the people of the district. I do not feel that has been the case,'' she said. A third primary candidate, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Briggs </PERSON>, has only a small political base. If neither Mrs. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> nor <PERSON> McCrery </PERSON> wins a majority the two top vote-getters will be forced into a runoff. Name recognition in Mrs. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>'s favor has n't hurt his campaign, <PERSON> McCrery </PERSON> said. `` I have lost a few of the <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> people who voted for me last time because of their allegiance to <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> and his mother. But they are few in number,'' he said. Mrs. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>, who described herself as a lifelong political activist most concerned with persuading qualified people to run for office, said <PERSON> McCrery </PERSON> cast a couple of votes `` that put up little red flags'' _ including opposition to a 60-day notification for plant closings and a catastrophic health care bill. `` I felt like he has cast a straight party line vote even when it hurt his district and it would not have hurt his standing in the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> for him to have voted differently,'' she said. The incumbent said he voted against the plant closing provision because it could have pushed small businesses into bankruptcy and would have discouraged expansion. He said the health care bill `` was not in the best interest of the district.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> said she decided to enter the race because no strong candidate was emerging to challenge <PERSON> McCrery </PERSON>. `` I walked down the levee and through the cotton fields and decided I would run.'' It certainly was n't the governor's idea, she said. `` When I called him up on that Saturday morning and told him I planned to run for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and asked him if that would cause him any problems, there was dead silence,'' she said. `` When he came back on, he said ` Mom, are you serious?''' <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Patti </PERSON>, recently appeared at a $ 1,000 per couple fund-raiser for his mother. Last spring, the governor drew the ire of state Democrats when he supported <PERSON> McCrery </PERSON>. <PERSON> McCrery </PERSON>, whose campaign raised about $ 80,000 with a fundraiser featuring retired Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, a major figure in the Iran-Contra controversy, said he has done in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> exactly what he promised to do. `` No. 1 is what is in the best interest of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. No. 2 is what is in the best interest of the district. I said that during the last campaign,'' he said. <PERSON> McCrery </PERSON>, 38, said he hopes the race will not have negative effects on the district. `` I have supported <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> for a number of years and hope to continue to support his efforts to turn around the economy of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 A conductor of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s Bolshoi Opera said Thursday he defected to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> because his outspoken doubts about Soviet politics made him a second-class citizen and hampered his work in his own country. `` While we were trying to build one type of society in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, we were in fact building one very different, one in which it was very difficult to live and in which there was little hope for the future,'' said <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Z. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vartanyan </PERSON>, who sought asylum at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> last week while visiting that nation. `` I am an outspoken person,'' <PERSON> Vartanyan </PERSON> told a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> news conference. `` I could not disguise my feelings,'' <PERSON> Vartanyan </PERSON> said, and he believes that `` informers reported back to the authorities.'' <PERSON> Vartanyan </PERSON> said he first experienced trouble on his return to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in 1976 after a stay of nearly six years in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, where he was the principal conductor of the National Symphonic Orchestra in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION>. Although he was never charged or openly accused of disloyalty to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, he was unable to find a permanent post for four years after his return. The situation improved slightly after he wrote a letter to <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, who was then the Soviet president, and from 1980 until his defection <PERSON> Vartanyan </PERSON> was one of several conductors at the <LOCATION> Bolshoi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, conducting more that 500 performances. <PERSON> Vartanyan </PERSON> met last week with <PERSON> Mstislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostropovich </PERSON>, another Soviet defector, who is now director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The two were acquainted years ago in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, when <PERSON> Vartanyan </PERSON> was principal conductor of the Armenian State Symphony in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rostropovich </PERSON> was unfamiliar with <PERSON> Vartanyan </PERSON>'s work and had no comment on the defection, said a spokeswoman for <PERSON> Rostropovich </PERSON>. `` They had been very much out of touch and Mr. <PERSON> Rostropovich </PERSON> did not know that Mr. <PERSON> Vartanyan </PERSON> was conducting at the Bolshoi. He did, however, recognize his face,'' said the spokeswoman, <PERSON> Nadya </PERSON> <PERSON> Efremov </PERSON>. <PERSON> Vartanyan </PERSON>, whose defection was disclosed Wednesday, has not received any invitations to work in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but told reporters: `` I am an optimist.'' The Soviet conductor said that he had great respect for <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his attempts to reform Soviet society. Although there have been improvements in literature, film and theater, `` in music, things are the opposite,'' said <PERSON> Vartanyan </PERSON>. `` The political leadership is not as interested in music as they are in literature and film,'' he said. The world of Soviet music is run by `` the same people in the ministries and the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> who have sat there for the past 20 years. It is impossible for them to change,'' he said. The Bolshoi Theater, which includes an opera and a ballet company, remains a political fiefdom where the level of artistic discussion `` can be compared to any graveyard in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>,'' and the director fires those who disagree with him, he said. `` I do not consider myself a traitor or a defector,'' he said. But `` I felt I was under suspicion and did not have the confidence of the people who ran the musical world. They did not have confidence in my political views.'' Because of that, he said, he was considered `` a second class citizen'' and `` a member of the lowest category'' of society. <PERSON> Vartanyan </PERSON> said that his only close relative in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was a sister. His wife died two years ago, they had no children, and his parents are deceased, he said.

 <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Povah </PERSON> is up to his warehouse ceiling in sweatshirts, coffee mugs, fishing tackle and thousands of other items normally carted home by tourists during a typical Yellowstone summer. But the summer of'88 was far from typical in the country's first national park Forest fires that raged over half of <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>'s 2.2 million acres meant evacuation and early closure of many facilities It also meant the hasty exit of thousands of visitors who ordinarily would crowd the aisles of <PERSON> Povah </PERSON>'s 15 retail stores past Labor Day. `` Will I have to re-order inventory for next year? God, I hope not!'' said <PERSON> Povah </PERSON>, 43, president of his family's <ORGANIZATION> Hamilton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the oldest concessioner under the jurisdiction of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` First we had the Great Depression, then World War II, then the'59 earthquake, then the Arab oil embargo, then the'76 Teton Dam disaster, and now the fires. There are always hurdles in the road. This is just another one. I try to be philosophical. `` Wan na buy a T-shirt cheap?'' <PERSON> Povah </PERSON>'s quip is typical of the kind of humor he says has helped his family cope with <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Nature </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> bureaucrats during the nearly three quarters of a century <ORGANIZATION> Hamilton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> has been in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>. `` We basically fly with one eye open anyway,'' said <PERSON> Povah </PERSON>. `` Who's to say in August of'88 that we wo n't have a gas shortage in July of'89 and the tourists wo n't come anyway? The company philosophy is conservative. That means we have a 72-year history of annual crapshoots.'' <PERSON> Povah </PERSON>'s grandfather, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashworth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, arrived in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> by train in 1905 from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, and went to work for the <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which then ran the commissary. Through three generations of its owners' grit, hunches, neck protrusion and luck, <ORGANIZATION> Hamilton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION>, which formally began in 1915 when its founder bought out a retiring storekeeper at Old Faithful, has grown into a multimillion-dollar operation. Today Hamilton Stores concessions are scattered throughout the park. They include service stations, snack bars, grocery and general merchandise stores, and camera shops. They also provide 12 dormitories for their 800 summer employees. <PERSON> Povah </PERSON> says his family will remember this year for a long time. `` It was wild,'' he said, shaking his head. `` In May and June we were doing a tremendous business, so in July we heavily re-ordered. Then the fires came. `` We did n't lose any facilities but we had smoke-damaged merchandise and a helluva lot of inconvenience.'' He even spent a few days helping fight fires with his company's two fire trucks `` There'd be a power outage and we'd be running around trying to save ice cream. Then Old Faithful was threatened and we were shuffling all the merchandise around,'' <PERSON> Povah </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Povah </PERSON> recalled the night he and his three children, headed home to West Yellowstone from the park, got cut off and had to wait it out while hundreds of firefighters fought one of the biggest blazes. `` The kids were saying ` Uh, Dad, I think you should turn around' and I looked to see flames everywhere,'' said <PERSON> Povah </PERSON> `` I tried to say ` No problem' but I was a little worried.'' So how's Povah going to relax after such a stressful summer? `` I'm going to take a bus from <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> over 18,000-foot-high mountain passes,'' he said. `` That should prepare me for next summer in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>.''

 A shooting that began in an auto parts store and ended at a school nearby left five dead today and at least two wounded, authorities said. A woman police officer, two employees of the store and a school janitor died, and the gunman also was killed, said fire department spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheppard </PERSON>. `` We had a shootout,'' said <PERSON> Thelma </PERSON> <PERSON> Catto </PERSON>, a payroll clerk at the <ORGANIZATION> Montefiore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` Right now, my office is a pool of blood.'' Officials said the shooting was not school-related, though the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> school is a special one for troubled boys. It is about a half-block from the store. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> LaGreca </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> fire department, said the incident began with an attempted holdup at the store and the gunman was chased into the school. But police said later that robbery was not the motive. `` It appears to be somebody who has a grudge,'' said police Commander <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Maurer </PERSON>. Classes at the school, which has an enrollment of about 135, were in session at the time of the shooting but no students or teachers were injured, said school Superintendent <PERSON> Manford </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>. Social workers were sent to the school to help students cope with the incident. Detective <PERSON> Riccardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Abreu </PERSON> said there was no evidence that anyone was involved in the incident except for the gunman who died. In addition to the five dead, a second police officer was injured, said deputy chief <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. And a hospital reported treating a man whose occupation was not immediately determined. The second police officer was shot in both legs, <PERSON> Sheppard </PERSON> said. A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sinai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> said the officer was in serious but stable condition at the hospital. The shooting began at the Comet Auto Parts store, witnesses and officials said. `` Shots apparently happened outside the school,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Saigh </PERSON>. `` I understand the individual was pursued into the building and more shots were fired. `` It is not school-related,'' <PERSON> Saigh </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Catto </PERSON> said she heard shots and ducked under her desk. One school employee, whom she would only describe as a custodian, was shot and came into her office. `` I hid in the storeroom,'' she said. A man who lives near the school, <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> <PERSON> McBroom </PERSON>, 26, said he witnessed much of the incident trough the window of his home. `` After the shots had been fired, I went to the window,'' <PERSON> McBroom </PERSON> said. `` I saw one cop laying down. He was shot but not dead.'' Other police officers arrived and `` came out with one policeman who had been shot in the head and another one with bloodstains on his chest. They were not moving,'' <PERSON> McBroom </PERSON> said. Four victims were brought to <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Wanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, a hospital spokeswoman. Three were taken immediately to the trauma unit, which handles the most serious medical emergencies. All three died at the trauma unit, she said. The <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> medical examiner's office said the other two dead persons apparently died at the scene. <PERSON> Saigh </PERSON> identified the dead custodian as <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said he was 33, and said the other two who died at the hospital were <PERSON> Irma </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON>, no age or occupation, and an unidentified man. The wounded officer at <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sinai </LOCATION> was identified as <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaglowski </PERSON>, 38. The other wounded person, brought to <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, was <LOCATION> Leplace </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chestnut </LOCATION>, 34, who was shot in the hand and was in good condition, Ms. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said. She did n't know if Ms. <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON> or Chestnut were police officers.

 The 26th <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION> turns its lens this year on emerging cinema talents and on maverick filmmakers who make personal statements with their works, including such well-known talents as <PERSON> Clint </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassavetes </PERSON>. The annual film fete, which opens Friday at <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> with <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Almodovar </PERSON>'s `` Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,'' features more works by women directors than ever before. It also marks the festival debut of actor-director <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON>, who is bringing `` Bird,'' his graceful and evocative story of the great saxophonist, <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, and the return of the innovative <PERSON> Cassavetes </PERSON> with `` Opening Night,'' a shattering drama about an actress who is deeply affected by the death of a fan. <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON> is typical of those festival filmmakers whose works reflect a personal statement. `` Bird'' was a labor of love. Devoted to jazz since his youth when he listened to his mother's <PERSON> Fats </PERSON> <PERSON> Waller </PERSON> records, he played piano and later the flugelhorn When he was a teen-ager, <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON> played at a club in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` It was an influential time for me and when I first heard <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> I was overwhelmed,'' he said in an interview. `` Those early records were just dazzling. A lot of people did n't understand it. `` Bird'' won two awards at this year's <ORGANIZATION> Cannes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION>, including best actor for <PERSON> Forest </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON>, who portrays the jazz great, and a special prize for the picture's craftsmanship. <PERSON> Cassavetes </PERSON> last appeared at the film festival with `` A Woman Under the Influence'' in 1974. `` Closing Night,'' starring his wife, <PERSON> Gena </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowlands </PERSON>, was made in 1978 but never commercially released. `` The type of films we do are different,'' the director-actor-writer once said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` Commercial movies have no feeling, no sensitivity. Most people tell me that people wo n't understand films with feeling. But everyone can feel. `` I think people have an understanding of what their life is. I define success by being a realist and not humiliating people. I'm a revolutionary, but not in the political sense.'' More than 400 films were screened by the festival's selection committee, whose new chairman is <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Pena </PERSON>, a director of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. He is an outspoken advocate of Third World cinema. His replacement of former director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Roud </PERSON> caused a stir in film circles and on the selection committee itself, with some critics pulling out. <PERSON> Roud </PERSON> was ousted because of personal disagreements between him and other members of the <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> said <PERSON> Roud </PERSON> still works with the film society. `` Women on the Verge,'' a wacky vision of love starring <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Maura </PERSON>, is the <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> director's festival debut. His comedies, `` What I Done to Deserve This?'' and `` Law of Desire,'' previously were hits at the New Directors-New Film series in 1985 and'87. The festival closes Oct. 9 with `` Red Sorghum,'' the directorial debut of <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> <PERSON> Yimou </PERSON>, the award-winning cinematographer of `` Yellow Earth'' and `` The Big Parade.'' In `` Red Sorghum,'' he presents a semi-biographical story of his grandparents and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in the 1930s. Women directors represented this year include: <PERSON> Mira </PERSON> <PERSON> Nair </PERSON>, `` Salaam Bombay!'' about a 10-year-old boy's survival on the streets of <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Burroughs </PERSON>, <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> and <PERSON> Aerlyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Weissman </PERSON>, `` A Winter Tan,'' the story of a sexually obsessed school teacher; <PERSON> Christel </PERSON> <PERSON> Buschmann </PERSON>, <PERSON> Helke </PERSON> <PERSON> Sander </PERSON>, <PERSON> Helma </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders-Brahms </PERSON> and <PERSON> Margarethe </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Trotta </PERSON>, `` Felix'' a comedy about a German Casanova; <PERSON> Fiorella </PERSON> <PERSON> Infascelli </PERSON>, `` La Maschera''; <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Breillat </PERSON>, `` 36 Fillette,'' about a sexual provocative teen-age girl; <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunphy </PERSON>, `` Lived in Quotes,'' and <ORGANIZATION> Chick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strand </ORGANIZATION>, `` Fake Fruit Factory.'' The film festival also will focus on the new British cinema, Soviet cinema in the age of glasnost, the new <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> cinema and the new American independents. British works are represented by three directors whose works are highly personal and court realism: <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON>, `` High Hopes,'' about class tensions in the <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> administration; <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarman </PERSON>, `` The Last of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>,'' about Western civilization on the brink of the Apocalypse; and <PERSON> Terence </PERSON> <PERSON> Davies </PERSON>, `` Distant Voices, Still Lives,'' about a family's troubled life. <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Paradjanov </PERSON>, who with <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarkovsky </PERSON>, is considered among the most important Soviet directors in decades, will have the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> premiere of his `` Ashik Kherib.'' He had been forbidden to work in the cinema for 15 years. Two other Soviet films are being shown as retrospective pieces: `` The Onset of an Unknown Age,'' made two decades ago to commemorate the October Revolution; and `` <PERSON> Asya </PERSON>'s Happiness,'' directed by <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Konchalovsky </PERSON>, a film Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has called one of the best movies he's seen in years. Other festival entries include: _ <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ophuls </PERSON>' `` Hotel Terminus: The Life and Times of <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbie </PERSON>,'' about the Nazi war criminal. _ `` <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON>,'' the first Romanian film to be shown at the festival, directed by <PERSON> Mircea </PERSON> <PERSON> Daneliuc </PERSON>. _ `` Mapantsula,'' a South African film directed by <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmitz </PERSON> and told from the black perspective. _ `` <PERSON> Golub </PERSON>,'' a documentary on the Expressionist painter <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Golub </PERSON>. _ `` Hard Times,'' the festival debut of <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> director <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Botelho </PERSON>. _ `` A Man With Three Coffins,'' the festival's first Korean film. _ <PERSON> Hou </PERSON> <PERSON> Hsaio-hsien </PERSON>'s `` Daughter of the Nile.'' The festival also will present 16 animated and experimental shorts including the Daffy Duck cartoon `` Night of the Living Duck.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's savings institutions lost $ 7.5 billion in the first half of this year, the government reported Thursday, as a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leader called for the biggest federal bailout in history. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls lost $ 3.6 billion in the April-June quarter, a modest improvement over the $ 3.9 billion loss of the first quarter. Nevertheless, the industry in only the first half of the year is already approaching the post-Depression record loss of $ 7.8 billion for all of 1987. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, D-Wis., who is retiring after building a reputation as a penny-pinching legislator during 31 years in office, said Thursday that the next <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will have to appropriate at least $ 20 billion _ about $ 81 for every man, woman and child in the country _ to bail out the industry And healthy S & amp; Ls, which have been paying to close or merge failed institutions so far, will have to contribute an additional $ 30 billion, he said. `` It is with reluctant but profound conviction that I rise to state ... the next <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will be required to appropriate at least $ 20 billion,'' <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> said in a speech prepared for delivery on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor. `` The bailout-to-come will be the largest ever in the history of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. It will be far bigger than the combined cost of the assistance ... to <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> -LRB- </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> -LRB- </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>,'' he said. The bank board report and <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>'s statement came within a week of several new _ and larger than previous _ estimates of the cost of cleaning up the thrift industry. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> auditing arm, says it will cost $ 45 billion to $ 50 billion. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the trade group for commercial banks, says $ 74 billion and some private analysts put the cost as high as $ 100 billion. The bank board says it intends in October to raise its $ 31 billion projection. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> on Wednesday directed a top deputy, Undersecretary <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>, to independently assess the conflicting estimates. That would be the first step in a possible re-evaluation of the administration's stance, which has been that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has as much money as it can efficiently spend well into next year. At a time when the administration is struggling to reduce the federal budget deficit, the question of how much must be spent on <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls is becoming increasingly critical. Since mid-August alone, the bank board has pledged nearly $ 13 billion in assistance to resolve the cases of more than 50 institutions. Because <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> lacks the cash to complete rescue packages, its aid is coming in the form of prommissory notes and guarantees against certain kinds of future loss. According to figures released last week at a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> hearing, <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> has more than $ 19 billion in outstanding commitments. Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, said the commitments, which have been made without congressional approval, threaten to create a `` Constitutional cataclysm.'' <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> of being `` nonchalant'' about the problem and said, `` The administration has its head buried in the sand.'' In turn, Sen. <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Garn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, the senior Republican on the committee, criticized the `` sanctimonious attempts'' of colleagues to blame the administration and said he was `` outraged by repeated efforts to get the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> taxpayers to pick up the tab.'' <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> board economist <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Barth </PERSON> said he detected some signs of improvement in the latest financial report. Net losses declined for the second quarter in a row, from the record three-month loss of $ 4 billion in September-December 1987. The number of insolvent institutions among 3,092 reporting slipped from 509 to 497, and the percentage of money-losing institutions declined slightly from 31 percent to 29 percent. `` I like to think we have bottomed out and things wo n't get much worse,'' <PERSON> Barth </PERSON> said. He declined to offer an assessment of how the industry is faring in the current quarter, but he noted that about $ 800 million of the second quarter loss occurred at 60 institutions that have since been closed. As in the past, the industry's losses in the second quarter were concentrated in a relatively small number of institutions and in one state _ <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, which has been hard hit by the collapse of oil prices. The 271 thrift institutions in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> accounted for $ 3.2 billion of the loss. The 20 worst institutions in the nation _ 17 of them in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> _ lost $ 2.6 billion.

 President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> said he was leaving office at the end of his 6-year-term at midnight tonight and would hand power to an interim government. <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> failed today to elect a new head of state. <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> did not name members of the new interim cabinet. Presidential palace sources said the cabinet will be announced later in a presidential decree. `` I leave the presidency today worried and filled with anxiety,'' <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> told the nation in a five-minute farewell address televised nationwide. `` The constitutional authority should have passed through the free will of parliament members to a president who enjoys the confidence of the people,'' he said. <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>'s delegation of power to an interim government defies a warning by the nation's Moslem religious leaders that such a move would partition <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Earlier today, fighting broke out along the city's dividing <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION>, and state radio said gunmen killed two senior commanders of the mainstream Shiite Moslem Amal militia. Christians and Moslems have been fighting a civil war for the past 13 years, ravaging the once prosperous economy of this nation and dividing the country into factions controlled by bands of guerrillas. Under an unwritten national covenant dating from independence in 1943, the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> president must be a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION>, the prime minister a Sunni Moslem and the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> speaker a Shiite Moslem. <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Fakih </PERSON>, top Amal officers for southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, were killed `` instantly'' when a rocket-propelled grenade hit the car they were riding in on the <LOCATION> Ouzai </LOCATION> highway, the broadcast said. The highway is in Syrian-policed south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fakih </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> movement is backed by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, led a crackdown on pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> fundamentalists in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> earlier this year. That operation ousted the extremist <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, from most of the southern villages. Shell explosions and bursts of gunfire echoed across <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> after the Parliament speaker <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>, a Shiite Moslem, put off voting for 24 hours. Police said one Christian militiaman was killed and two soldiers of the regular army's predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> Moslem 6th Brigade were wounded in mortar and machine gun duels near the old Parliament headquarters. Moslems have said that if <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> appoints a Christian to be prime minister, they will declare their own republic in territory they control. That would formalize the breakup of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> into rival sectarian mini-states. Former President <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Helou </PERSON> said after meeting with <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> the new prime minister would probably be `` a member of the <PERSON> Helou </PERSON> clan.'' It was an apparent reference to his cousin, <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Helou </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> businessman who maintains close ties with several Moslem leaders. Three Christians are standing for election to replace the Maronite president. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> backs two of them: former President <PERSON> Suleiman </PERSON> <PERSON> Franjieh </PERSON>, 78, and 58-year-old Parliament Deputy <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Daher </PERSON>. The third, veteran politician <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Edde </PERSON>, has been living in self-imposed exile in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> for 12 years after escaping three assassination attempts in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Edde </PERSON>, 75, is the most popular in public opinion polls. But <PERSON> Daher </PERSON>'s chances appear stronger in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> because he is backed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as well as <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s main power broker. <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> has 40,000 troops in the country. Militant Christians have rejected both <PERSON> Daher </PERSON> and <PERSON> Franjieh </PERSON>, charging they would allow <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to become a <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> satellite and give Moslems too much power in the government.

<HEAD>Baltimore Mayor Says Legalize Drugs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BETH J. HARPAZ</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 Decriminalizing heroin and crack would remove the profit from the drug trade, reduce street crime, and ease the burden on the legal system, <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmoke </PERSON> said Thursday. `` I'd like to see leading the war on drugs, the surgeon general, not the attorney general,'' <PERSON> Schmoke </PERSON> said at a debate sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> and held before 100 business executives, students, and journalists. <PERSON> Schmoke </PERSON>, whose support of decriminalization caused a stir at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayors </ORGANIZATION> in April, plans to testify Sept. 29 at a congressional hearing on the issue. `` I was a prosecutor for 7 -LCB- years and I know what I'm talking about,'' <PERSON> Schmoke </PERSON> said. `` As long as we continue doing what we're doing, children are going to be lured into the drug trade and dirty needles are going to kill people I want to treat people with the disease called addiction as patients, not as criminals. `` You have to reallocate those resources to the public health system, toward education, treatment and prevention,'' he added. He also called for a national commission that would examine prescription and illegal drugs, alcohol and cigarettes to determine the most effective way to regulate each. <PERSON> Schmoke </PERSON> shared the dais with <PERSON> Georgette </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, a decriminalization advocate whose 1987 book `` Crimewarps'' about future crime trends was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize. Opposing them were <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stutman </PERSON>, a special agent with the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Director </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Substance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, who founded the <ORGANIZATION> Phoenix </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> drug rehabilitation program. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> showed the audience a bottle of multicolored pills, a container of liquid methadone and a bottle of brandy as examples of substances that are widely abused even though they are legal. <PERSON> Stutman </PERSON> disagreed with <PERSON> Schmoke </PERSON>'s assertion that Prohibition was a failure. <PERSON> Stutman </PERSON> noted a decline in alcoholism and cirrhosis of the liver during the Prohibition years, while <PERSON> Schmoke </PERSON> said making alcohol illegal gave rise to organized crime and deprived the government of tax revenue.

 Decades of racism and black unemployment made it inevitable that <LOCATION> Shreveport </LOCATION> would see an outbreak of violence like this week's rock-throwing and arson following the killing of a black man, a civil rights leader says. `` <LOCATION> Shreveport </LOCATION>'s been dodging the bullet for 25 years,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> English </PERSON> of the local <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> chapter. The violence Tuesday and Wednesday nights, set off when a white woman shot a black man, was confined to a few blocks in <LOCATION> Cedar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION>, a mostly residential neighborhood of modest houses and small businesses about six miles from downtown. Police spokeswoman <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chadwick </PERSON> said no problems were reported in <LOCATION> Cedar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION> after dozens of heavily armed Special Response Team officers left the area early Thursday. Police took down roadblocks that sealed off the area for about four hours Wednesday night, but <PERSON> Chadwick </PERSON> said beefed up patrols were ready to seal off the area again if violence resumed. The rioting was set off by the killing Tuesday night of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON>, 22. A 17-year-old white girl was arrested and officials said the shooting followed a drug deal that went bad, with the victim an innocent bystander. Black leaders said another factor was anger over the killing of a black teen-ager by a white teen-ager at a restaurant last month. And, they said, there was lingering frustration over the recent acquittal in west <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> of three law officers accused in the beating death of a <LOCATION> Florien </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, black man arrested last Christmas Day on suspicion of drunk driving. But those three incidents were only catalysts, black leaders said. The Rev. <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> and a long-time <LOCATION> Shreveport </LOCATION> civil rights leader, blamed long-standing `` institutional racism'' for the trouble. But he warned blacks against violence. `` Destruction is not the way. We need reasoning and logic,'' said <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. The Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> blamed the unrest on poverty and illiteracy. `` They've had too much access to guns and drugs and too little access to jobs, to scholarships,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>. `` In that city today, we must make the appeal for the haves and the have nots, the black and the white to come together and study war no more,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. Classes at Caddo Parish schools near the riot area continued without interruption, although Assistant Superintendent <PERSON> Ealie </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON> said absences would be excused if parents decided to keep their children home. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said security would be beefed up at this weekend's high school football games, where there have been occasional race-related problems over the years. But board official <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> said the security was planned before the <LOCATION> Cedar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION> incident because of a rash of minor stadium crimes. Tuesday's violence centered around a small grocery where the white shooting suspect and her companion fled after <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> was shot. The grocery and a neighboring liquor store were gutted by fire and a television news team's car was burned while hundreds of people rampaged, breaking store windows and looting. Five arrests were reported in connection with the rioting and <PERSON> Tamala </PERSON> <PERSON> Vergo </PERSON>, 17, was booked with second-degree murder. Official police reports contain few details but individual officers, city officials and one witness indicated <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> was an innocent bystander felled after a drug deal went sour. Wednesday night's violence was on a much smaller, less intense scale. There were reports of sporadic gunfire and at least one fire. But no injuries or arrests were reported as police let the troublemakers disperse by themselves. Residents say <PERSON> Cedar </PERSON> <PERSON> Grove </PERSON> once was a quiet, racially mixed suburb that has deteriorated for a variety of reasons. The area is now predominantly black, the apparent result of `` white flight'' during the civil rights years. One police officer called the small area where most of the violence occurred a `` curb-service crack store.'' <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamness </PERSON>, a former resident who moved away five years ago, said people of both races have left because of crime, particularly the drug trade. `` At one time it was peaceful,'' said <PERSON> Chamness </PERSON>. `` When I was young, children could walk up and down the streets without fear. Our moms could walk to the store. I do n't know what happened to the neighborhood.''

<HEAD>Bush Will Spend $32 Million on Ads</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan to spend a record amount on TV advertising continues a trend toward presidential campaign budgets dominated by paid media expenditures, political analysts said Thursday. Four years ago, Democratic nominee <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> spent more than $ 20 million on media and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> spent about $ 25 million. This fall, Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> expects to mount a $ 32 million-plus TV blitz. That's at least 60 percent of the combined $ 54 million that the candidate and his national party can spend directly. A <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aide, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, said 60 percent, or $ 32.4 million, is `` a pretty accurate figure, which would make it the largest television expenditure in modern history.'' <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gearan </PERSON>, a spokesman for <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the Democratic nominee, said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would be competitive on the airwaves but declined to be specific. Both candidates are relying on their parties to raise tens of millions of dollars in unrestricted `` soft money'' for political activities at the state and national levels, enabling them to divert a greater percentage of their own limited campaign resources to media. The soft money is available for party-building activities including lawn signs, phone banks, generic TV ads, voter registration and get-out-the-vote drives. Such expenditures do not count toward the candidates' overall spending ceiling. <PERSON> Bay </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s campaign treasurer in both 1980 and 1984, said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> campaign forked over several million dollars for get-out-the-vote activities four years ago. `` If you can get the party to raise it ... that's $ 3 million to $ 4 million dollars you'd obviously put to media time,'' she said. `` It's a very effective way to be running an organization. Usually the states know better how to raise and spend the money.'' The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> game plan represents the increasingly critical role played by TV advertising. `` The very first thing I did -LRB- in 1984 -RRB- was take 50 percent of the total amount we were allocated and put it to media,'' said <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON>. `` Then if any money could be picked up -LRB- from other areas -RRB-, we moved that money to media. That's where any loose money went because we felt it was the most effective way to reach voters.'' Democrats and Republicans alike say they are not surprised by this year's heavy tilt toward media spending, given the increasing importance of TV ads and the high cost of buying air time, particularly during widely watched events such as the Olympics and the World Series. But they caution against treating it as a revolutionary development. `` It's not a dramatic escalation of media dollars,'' said Republican consultant <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON>. `` It should n't be overstated. It's just incrementally more than has been spent before, in real terms and in percentage of the overall budget.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> took a step Thursday toward partial closing of a loophole that allows political parties to pour millions of `` soft money'' dollars indirectly into presidential election campaigns. The independent regulatory agency is under federal court order to clarify its vague rules on soft money, which is banned in federal elections but permitted in state and local contests. The commission unanimously agreed Wednesday to publish a notice in the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Register </ORGANIZATION> seeking public comment on proposed rule changes governing soft money. The new rules proposals include alternative methods of allocating funds that benefit both federal and local election activities. These include payment of administrative expenses and financing of voter registration drives. The <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> changes also could result in substantial bookkeeping requirements on state and local political organizations. Soft money includes union and corporate donations as well as individual contributions that exceed the federal limit of $ 1,000 per candidate. National political parties are limited to spending $ 8 million each toward electing a presidential candidate. But they accept millions of dollars in soft money accounts which they give to state and local affiliates fo Dukakis Courts Seniors

 A flash flood ripped through a mountain village and killed more than 100 people, including four policemen, authorities said Thursday. Home Ministry officials confirmed the deaths of 106 people and said the toll may still be higher because several visitors spent the night in the area Tuesday. The officials said at least 58 people lost their lives in <LOCATION> Darwang </LOCATION> village, 125 miles west of <LOCATION> Katmandu </LOCATION>, and 48 others died in nearby <LOCATION> Niskot </LOCATION>. Only four bodies have been recovered. Rescuers were searching for others. The flood began Tuesday night when a boulder broke loose from a landslide that dammed the <LOCATION> Myagdi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and created a huge lake.

 The USS Vincennes, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> cruiser that mistakenly shot down an Iranian airliner over the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, rescued 26 Vietnamese refugees from a sinking fishing junk early Thursday in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, officials said. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the guided-missile cruiser was steaming in heavy seas when a lookout spotted a burning torch. After changing course, the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> `` found a small, double-ended junk carrying 26 Vietnamese refugees,'' the spokesman said. `` The commanding officer determined the vessel to be unseaworthy and took all 26 people aboard,'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. Shortly after the 26 were rescued, `` the boat broke apart and sank'' in heavy seas, he said. `` They were literally spotted in the nick of time,'' added Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. `` They had been adrift for 15 days and were out of food, out of water and subsisting on rain water. And as soon as they got on board the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>, their boat sank.'' The <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> is transporting the refugees to its next port of call, the <LOCATION> Subic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. According to <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON>, one of the refugees spoke some English and told his rescuers the group had begun its voyage from the city of <LOCATION> Tra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vinh </LOCATION> in the southern section of what used to be <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. The rescue was the second for the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> in two months. Early in August, the cruiser rescued five Iranian fishermen who had been adrift in a small dinghy for more than a week after their boat sank. The <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> was operating at the time in the Gulf of <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>. A month before, on July 3, the cruiser accidently shot down an Iranian Air Bus, killing all 290 aboard, while steaming in the nearby <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. The rescue of Vietnamese refugees comes as the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is pursuing a pre-trial investigation of the captain of the USS Dubuque for his alleged dereliction of duty in failing to rescue another group of Vietnamese refugees in early June.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> struck back forcefully after <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s visit to his home grounds Thursday, accusing his Republican rival of being a `` fugitive from the truth'' in portraying himself as a crimefighter and advocate of the environment, education and elderly. `` We're here today to investigate a felony _ assault and battery on the truth,'' the Democratic presidential nominee told a boisterous rally outside the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION> shortly after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> to pick up an endorsement from the leaders of a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> police union. `` What <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is doing to the truth in this campaign is a crime,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in his harshest attack yet on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. He spoke to hundreds of cheering supporters and law enforcement officials called in from around the nation to counter <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s endorsement by the police group. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also spent considerable time Thursday preparing for his Sunday debate with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, meeting with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> to discuss strategy and also attending a morning meeting with staff at a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> hotel where he is scheduled to take part in a mock debate Friday. At the rally, recalling <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s visit earlier this month to tour polluted <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said the vice president `` came here to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> to impersonate an environmentalist.'' He portrayed the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration as an enemy of the Clean Water Act and programs to clean up toxic waste. `` That's not the only time Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been a fugitive from the truth,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, ridiculing his rival's pledge to be the education president and saying that when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has criticized the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> economy, `` he's mugged the truth every time he's opened his mouth. Surrounded by police officers from several <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> departments as well as by law enforcement officials from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> and two nationwide police associations, representing more than 100,000 officers in all, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: `` Now he's here in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> impersonating a law enforcement officer. `` We're here to give <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> what <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> Friday used to ask for: just the facts ma'am, just the facts,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, invoking the name of the fictional character in the popular `` Dragnet'' television series. `` His administration has waged not a war on crime but a war on crime programs,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. He then launched a scathing attack on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s crimefighting record, saying drug task forces the vice president headed were dismal failures. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also attacked <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration ethical standards and lashed back at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s frequent criticism of a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> furlough program that, until amended earlier this year, allowed weekend passes to first-degree murderers. `` For the past eight years <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been running with a crowd that would n't know the rule of law if it hit them in the face,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said to rousing applause. As for furloughs, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said the federal government furloughed nearly 16,000 inmates last year for up to 45 days at a time, among them `` hundreds and hundreds of drug pushers and drug traffickers.'' And he said the suspect in the murder of a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> police officer was a repeat violent offender who had been paroled from federal prison after serving less than half of a prison term for bank robbery. `` That's what's going on in the federal system these days, my friends,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had an energetic supporting cast for his rally, including <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLord </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Combined </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION>, the largest police organization in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s adopted home state. `` I'm tired of this pandering,'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign. `` I'm tired of the simplistics and the distortions by people like the vice president.'' <PERSON> DeLord </PERSON>, who gave <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> a 10-gallon hat after the rally, fired up the crowd with an impassioned attack on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> delivered in the style of a preacher. `` I'm the only damn Texan in this town today representing police officers, not <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> DeLord </PERSON> said. <PERSON> DeLord </PERSON> said he has been president of the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> organization for 12 years and, `` I've never seen <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in person.'' The rhetorical flogging of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his supporters overshadowed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' only planned event of the day _ a visit to a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> senior citizens center to reiterate his support for Social Security while attacking <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for breaking a tie in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 with his vote to deny cost-of-living adjustments to Social Security recipients. `` When election time rolls around, Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says he wants to be a great friend of older Americans,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` Maybe he thinks we all have amnesia.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also noted that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, was among the Republicans voting to block the cost-of-living adjustments `` <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and I have a very different view,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in touting his running mate, the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator. `` We're going to stop this attack on Social Security and <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> and we'll stop it cold.''

<TEXT>
 Violence in <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>'s Cathedral that left an usher and his deranged attacker dead was a `` special sacrilege and tragedy,'' Cardinal <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said Thursday as he resanctified the church and prayed for the assailant and victim alike. It was the first time in the 109-year history of the church that the rite to purify a profaned sacred place was performed. The attack occurred about 8 p.m. Wednesday, an hour before the church would close, when a man ran naked through the cathedral and bludgeoned part-time usher <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Winters </PERSON>, 77, to death with an iron stanchion. He also injured a worshiper and a police officer before being shot to death by police. The cardinal had seen the man, <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> DelGado </PERSON>, 32, at morning Mass that day when <PERSON> Delgado </PERSON> joined the line for communion. `` It was clear instantly there was something seriously wrong,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said. `` I looked up and there he is, standing before me, a very big man, a very powerful looking man, bizarrely dressed.'' `` He rolled his eyes. He opened and closed his eyes. He rolled his head and the priest who was standing next to me whispered, ` Be careful. He gets violent,''' the cardinal said. <PERSON> DelGado </PERSON>, a vagrant who was born on St. Patrick's Day in 1956 had pleaded guilty 11 times since 1982 to charges including assault, attempted robbery and burglary. He had been in the cathedral many times and had committed minor acts of vandalism there before. Many homeless people enter the church to avoid the heat or cold or to find a place to sleep. Despite the attack, the archdiocese will not change its open-door policy, <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said. `` I would hate to see us now get defensive.'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> was not in the cathedral when <PERSON> DelGado </PERSON>, naked and carrying red carnations and his sneakers, came into the church Wednesday night. <PERSON> DelGado </PERSON> had stripped off his dirty shorts and shirt minutes before in front of the RCA Building at Rockefeller Plaza, a block away from the Fifth Avenue cathedral. When he first entered the church, <PERSON> DelGado </PERSON> hit a man sitting in a back pew with the flowers and screamed, `` Get out! Get out!'' said Chief of Detectives <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Colangelo </PERSON>. He continued walking up the center aisle of the church to the pew in which <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>, 39, was praying and repeatedly struck her in the face, <PERSON> Colangelo </PERSON> said. The 6-foot-4, 250-pound <PERSON> DelGado </PERSON> then went to the altar of the shrine of <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> and pulled from the marble floor a bolted, wrought-iron stanchion that held a prayer plaque. Officer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McMann </PERSON>, 50, who is assigned to the cathedral, spotted <PERSON> DelGado </PERSON> and ordered him to put down the weapon. As <PERSON> DelGado </PERSON> advanced on <PERSON> McMann </PERSON>, the officer radioed for help. <PERSON> DelGado </PERSON> attacked the officer, striking him in the head. He then went to the main altar, where he found <PERSON> Winters </PERSON>, and struck him seven or eight times in the head, killing him istantly, <PERSON> Colangelo </PERSON> said. By then, three other officers arrived and repeatedly ordered <PERSON> DelGado </PERSON> to stop. When <PERSON> DelGado </PERSON> started to lunge toward one, the officer fired once, fatally striking <PERSON> DelGado </PERSON> in the chest, the chief said. The entire incident was over in 10 minutes. Ms. <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> was treated for facial injuries at the scene and <PERSON> McMann </PERSON> was in stable condition Thursday at <ORGANIZATION> Bellevue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. Before performing the resanctification rite, <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> spoke about <PERSON> DelGado </PERSON>, saying he believed the attacker did n't `` have the slightest idea what he was doing.'' `` For it to have happened here is a special sacrilege and tragedy,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said, adding that <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>'s was a `` magnet for Catholics everywhere.'' `` While the cathedral has been desecrated, while this magnificent temple of almighty God, famous throughout the world, has been violated, we must not forget that two men were killed here last night,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> told several hundred people attending the first Mass of the day. `` It is for their souls I will be offering this Mass, as well as for the purification of the cathedral.''

<HEAD>EPA Wants to Teach America to Recycle Garbage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Calling the garbage disposal problem `` on top of us,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> unveiled ambitious draft plans Thursday to persuade Americans to recycle a quarter of their garbage in four years. That would be 2 -LCB- times the proportion recycled today. In a society that puts a premium on convenience and saving time and energy, Americans generate 3.5 pounds of garbage and trash each day for every man, woman and child. Places to put it are rapidly disappearing, as shown by the saga of the garbage barge from <LOCATION> Islip </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> last year that could n't unload Recylcing and the companion strategy of generating less garbage in the first place _ `` source reduction'' _ enjoyed a vogue in the early 1970s but lost steam in most places. For example, <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> claims to recycle more than 100 percent of its aluminum beverage cans because it accepts cans made by others. It's much cheaper to buy an old can and melt it down for new aluminum than to refine aluminum ore. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>, the agency's assistant administrator for solid waste, said soaring costs of landfilling will bring recycling back `` Not only does it feel good, there are stark economic realities out there'' to push recycling, <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> told a briefing for reporters on the draft strategy put together by a special <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> task force convened in February. In the 1970s, `` When people got energetic about recycling, they quickly hit the hard economic realities. Landfilling was available for $ 2 a ton. Now it's $ 50 or $ 100,'' <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> said. Though <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, has plenty of land nearby and pays $ 6 a ton for landfilling, East Lyme, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, recently paid $ 100 a ton, the agency said. From 18,000 in the 1970s and 9,000 in 1984, the number of landfills has shrunk to about 6,000 and the agency believes a third of those will close in the next five years. Today's landfills handle 80 percent of 160 million tons of garbage and trash a year. The rest is equally split between recycling and incineration. The load is growing, mostly because of paper. Wastepaper has risen about 50 percent since 1960 to about 65 million tons a year _ paper for take-out dinners, paper for diapers, paper for computer outputs, paper for hospital `` Twenty percent of that is recycled now. That could be roughly doubled,'' said <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>. About 1 percent of plastics is recycled. `` We could get to 8 or 10 percent without much trouble.'' The agency hopes to see recycling and reduced generation at 25 percent and incineration at 20 percent in 1992, leaving 55 percent to be landfilled. Ten states already require recycling in some form or other, and 600 communities do it. These programs frequently require householders to separate metals, plastics, glass, paper, leftover food and yard waste before collection. The agency has given a $ 250,000 grant to the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> for an advertising campaign in cooperation with the Advertising Council to promote recycling. Asked about the usefulness of mandatory refundable deposits on purchases of soft drinks, as some states require, <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> said he would be reluctant to prescribe for every state, but `` I have seen some good successes. Generally, I'm personally in favor of that ...'' `` What's going to be needed is an executive order by the president, probably the next president, directing federal agencies to purchase recycled goods,'' <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> said. `` That would jump-start a lot of things.'' An environmentalist was skeptical. `` It appears to me to be more of an exercise in public relations,'' said <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> of the Clean Water Action Project. `` We think new incinerators should not be permitted until a community has met recycling goals,'' which should be set at about 50 percent of the waste stream, <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said.

 A congressional candidate being sued by <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> for allegedly distributing posters accusing the airline of spreading AIDS may be disavowed by his party, the state <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> chairman said Thursday. `` He was a realtor, an educator and seemed like a nice guy,'' state party Chairman <PERSON> Buie </PERSON> <PERSON> Seawell </PERSON> said of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, 53, of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> was nominated without opposition in the heavily <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> 5th District to run against freshman Rep. <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hefley </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidate. The district encompasses the <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> area south of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, and it never has sent a Democrat to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Seawell </PERSON> compared <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> to a `` walk-on candidate'' and said the party nominated him `` with the best of intentions.'' `` But we were not tough-minded enough _ almost nobody is under these circumstances _ and we've got to begin to get that way,'' he said. Neither Democratic Party officials nor reporters have been able to reach <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> for comment by telephone or in person since his name surfaced in the lawsuit filed Monday by <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> federal court suit accuses <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> of libeling the airline and seeks $ 500,000 damages. <PERSON> Seawell </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> 5th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> will meet Oct. 2 to consider the <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> case. The State Centays, read: `` AIDS is Spread Through <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>,'' `` Today's <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> Means AIDS'' and <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>: Travel With AIDS.'' <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> claims <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> sent a poster to the airline's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office on July 26 with a note that said: `` Thousands of these have been sent around the country. Our staff is working on a new poster. They will continue to be sent until <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> corrects the hurt you have caused-cost me.'' If <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> does not remove himself as a candidate, the party may move to disavow itself from <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Seawell </PERSON>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> does not, in any way, endorse or condone alleged statements made by Mr. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> regarding <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Seawell </PERSON> said it may take a court action to actually remove <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s name from the ballot. `` We will do everything necessary to provide a fair hearing before any action is taken by the 5th District, the chairman or the central committee,'' he added. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, who has no previous political experience, has operated <ORGANIZATION> J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mitchell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realty </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> since 1984, according to his resume.

 It's not as cheap as a string around the finger, but a new gadget for the forgetful gives a gentle nudge at the waistline as a reminder of whatever it is the wearer wants to be reminded. A psychologist invented the vibrating gadget named the MotivAider. The invention is based on what psychologist <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Levinson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Thief </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> says is obvious _ that the human brain does a poor job of making sure its owner does all the things that a person has firmly resolved to do. The gadget he calls an `` intention arousing device,'' is about 2 inches square and hangs like a beeper from the user's belt. Set for intervals of one minute to 24 hours, it flutters silently against the waistline. The wearer has programmed in his or her memory what the reminder means, says <PERSON> Levinson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ros </PERSON> <PERSON> Fairbank </PERSON>, who lost to <PERSON> Martina </PERSON> <PERSON> Navratilova </PERSON> in the Wimbledon quarterfinals this year, told the <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> that it helped improve her backhand. Her problem was failing to get her racquet back early enough and to `` hit over the ball,'' she said in a phone interview. She set the MotivAider at three-minute intervals and wore it during practice. When it vibrated, she said to herself `` Early preparation!'' and that's what she focused on. `` I would n't say it made me win a match,'' she said, `` but it developed my backhand and my confidence in my backhand.'' <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Priedeman </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Deephaven </ORGANIZATION> sales manager, says he improved his golf game.

The <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> county accepted the challenge, but was unable to attend last year's cook-off in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, he said. `` They even went so far as to approach their <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> to get a resolution claiming they had the original <ORGANIZATION> Brunswick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stew </ORGANIZATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Woodside </ORGANIZATION> said. So, in the spirit of competition, the <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION> legislative delegation approached the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> and received a similar resolution. Chef <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickerson </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s version of <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION> stew uses a chicken base instead of the pork or beef used by the Georgians and is not as spicy as the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> version.

 Bahamian Prime Minister <PERSON> Lynden </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON> says former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> knowingly used false testimony in a criminal probe involving allegations that <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON> had accepted bribes from drug traffickers. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Loye </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> declined comment Thursday on <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON>'s accusations, contained in a letter the <LOCATION> Bahamian </LOCATION> government said was delivered to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>. It calls for appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON>, the former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, for prosecutorial misconduct. A three-page statement describing the letter was made available to the news media by the Bahamian embassy in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The letter by an attorney for <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Dement </PERSON>, says <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> `` used perjured evidence, knowing it to be false or not caring whether it was true or untrue, seeming for political gain.'' <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> was defeated in a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> primary election earlier this month in a bid for a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat. Convicted drug smuggler <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Baron </PERSON> testified under questioning by <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> earlier this year at the trial of Colombian drug dealer <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> that in 1980, he paid <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON> $ 400,000 in cash in a <LOCATION> Paradise </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> casino in the presence of <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON>, Tourism Minister <PERSON> Clement </PERSON> <PERSON> Maynard </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Maynard </PERSON> and many others. <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> opened a grand jury probe of <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dement </PERSON> said testimony by <PERSON> Baron </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON> <PERSON> Bannister </PERSON> alleging official complicity in drug smuggling was easily refutable, but that <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> made no effort to check out their stories. In May 1988, <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> was advised by <PERSON> Pindling </PERSON>'s personal attorney, <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, that <PERSON> Bannister </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baron </PERSON> were lying, said <PERSON> Dement </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> offered <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> the full cooperation of the prime minister, said <PERSON> Dement </PERSON>, who added that <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> is prepared to testify that <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> `` promised an expeditious conclusion'' of his probe. <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> used <PERSON> Baron </PERSON>'s groundless recitation again, only a month later, in the trial of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Castoro </PERSON> without making an effort to verify his testimony, said <PERSON> Dement </PERSON>. The statement made available to the news media said <PERSON> Dement </PERSON> sent <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> documentation showing that the Pindlings were in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> when the payoff allegedly was made. <PERSON> Dement </PERSON> said the prime minister and Deputy Prime Minister <PERSON> Clement </PERSON> <PERSON> Maynard </PERSON> have indicated they are willing to cooperate in an investigation of the allegations of Banister and <PERSON> Baron </PERSON> and the lack of effort by <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> to review the evidence of that falsity. In an interview in Thursday editions of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> was quoted as saying that `` Sir <PERSON> Lynden </PERSON> is full of hot air'' and that his investigation was handled in accord with <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> rules.

 A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee on Thursday approved a $ 550,000 budget increase for the ethics committee to cover mounting costs of an investigation into allegations of financial improprieties by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. The chairman of the ethics panel, Rep. <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Calif., said the outside counsel hired to conduct the investigation has been costing $ 150,000 a month and by the end of this month would exhaust the $ 300,000 earlier earmarked for the probe `` It's taking a lot of time,'' said Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ind </LOCATION>., the senior minority member of the ethics committee, formally known as the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct `` It takes a lot more in-depth investigation than we ever anticipated.'' But he added: `` We have a commitment to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>'' to be thorough. `` This is necessary. I do n't think we have any choice.'' The counsel, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>, has assigned six or seven attorneys to work on the case, which involves allegations that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, abused his congressional office for personal gain and improperly intervened with federal regulators on behalf of constituents. The attorneys together are spending an average of 1,200 to 1,300 hours monthly on the probe, <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, the chamber's housekeeping panel, that the $ 550,000 funding boost would enable the probe to extend through the end of the year, if needed It also is possible the investigation could extend into 1989, <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, who appeared before the panel for more than five hours last week to present his defense, has said repeatedly that he wants the investigation completed before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> adjourns for the year in mid-October. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> declined to comment on why the probe was taking longer than expected. On a separate matter relating to the speaker, <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> told reporters that a new request from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Republican leadership for an ethics probe of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, concerning his disclosure of a purported <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> covert action in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, would be dealt with separately from the current probe. `` That would be done independent of this,'' he said. `` I think it would be done in a whole different manner,'' perhaps with the cooperation of the <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, he added.

<TEXT>
 Republican vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said Thursday that perestroika in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has yet to live up to its promise, and he cautioned against making unilateral concessions to the Soviets at the arms table. The <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator wrapped up a four-day swing across the West with what aides billed as a major foreign policy address, and he used a TelePrompTer for the first time since his convention acceptance speech. In a foreign policy speech earlier this month in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> discarded his text and gave a rambling, discursive address. Addressing 1,300 people at a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> luncheon, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> made no mention of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the Democratic presidential candidate. But he criticized several <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> foreign policy and defense stances. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> recognizes that `` without major changes, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> could well enter the next century ... -LRB- like -RRB- a Third World nation.'' Of perestroika, or restructuring, he said, `` Like the book of the same name, actual content has so far not lived up to the advance press notices.'' Americans should judge the Soviets' actions by whether they pull back from `` global ` pot stirring''' in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and other places, he said. He called the Soviet radar station at <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> a blatant violation of the ABM Treaty and it should be dismantled immediately, not turned into an international space tracking station as <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> recently suggested. He also urged the Soviets to demonstrate their seriousness on arms control by reducing their long-range SS-18 missiles and their new, mobile SS-24s and SS-25s. And <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> should `` show his good faih by renouncing the <ORGANIZATION> Brezhnev </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Doctrine </ORGANIZATION> unequivocally'' and agreeing to a pullback of Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, he said. Because of the current imbalance of Soviet and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> forces, the Soviets must pull back more troops, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. He also called for the Soviets to allow freedom to emigrate `` for Jews and refuseniks and anyone else.'' `` One does not deal with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> by unilaterally removing negotiating leverage before the negotiations even begin,'' he said, in what appeared to be a reference to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' opposition to the mobile MX and Midgetman missiles. Turning to Star Wars, he said the proposed space-based missile defense system `` is not a ` fantasy' or a ` fraud' or a ` gizmo' as some have called it.'' `` It is the margin of survival for American citizens if a nuclear missile, whether by design or accident, is ever launched against our land,'' he said. He urged a return to bipartisanship in foreign policy, saying, `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> serves the nation best when it allows the president maximum freedom in foreign policy decision-making.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who says the War Powers Act should be curtailed or drastically rewritten, said cited <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> as an example of a confused foreign policy. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has no business `` drawing silly distinctions between lethal and non-lethal aid to a guerrilla army.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> fielded 13 questions from the audience, strongly defending Contra aid with a declaration that `` the <ORGANIZATION> Monroe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Doctrine </ORGANIZATION> is alive and well in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' `` There is something in this country that is called the Monroe Doctrine ... -LRB- that -RRB- says foreign powers coming into our hemisphere ... is against the national interest of this country,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he voted for sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> `` to send a message that we must begin to work and to see what a post-apartheid government will look like.'' But he said he does not support additional sanctions now. Meanwhile, in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s campaign said that Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>, R-Ore., will play Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> as <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> prepares for the Oct. 5 debate with his Democratic counterpart <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON> preceded <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, serves on the panel with <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and is considered a top debater in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Airlines Told To Equip Aircraft With Devices To Detect Wind Shear</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday ordered airlines to equip all their aircraft with devices that will help pilots detect and escape from deadly wind shears. Powerful shears called microbursts have been called the No. 1 killer of airline passengers and have been responsible for at least five fatal airline crashes and 500 deaths in the last decade, according to aviation safety experts. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> regulation was announced by the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which said the devices, to be phased into operation in all aircraft of 30 or more seats over the next four years, will cost $ 40,000 to $ 50,000 per airplane. About 3,600 commercial jet transport planes also will be required to have the devices, department officials said. A microburst is a powerful downburst of air caused by a sudden change in wind direction. Such a downburst struck a <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> L-1011 as it was attempting to land at <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> in 1985 and literally forced the plane into the ground, killing 134 people. The accident focused increased attention on developing and installing sophisticated ground radar that would provide advanced warning of shears along departure and approach lanes, but the radar is not expected to be available until the early 1990s. At the same time, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> and industry began taking a closer look at devices for the cockpit that would provide pilots with a clear indication when their plane is facing wind shear conditions. <ORGANIZATION> Piedmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> two years ago began installing the equipment being required by the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> and today has the devices in 112 of its 191 aircraft, according to <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>. It could not immediately be determined whether other airlines have bought similar equipment. Under the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> regulation the airlines will be allowed to phase in installation of the equipment over about four years. Half of an airline's fleet must have the devices within 27 months, three-fourths of the fleet within 39 months and the rest of the fleet within 51 months. Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnley </PERSON> said the equipment `` will enhance safety by giving pilots a valuable tool for coping with the dangerous wind shear phenomenon.'' `` Experience has shown that pilots can recover successfully from wind shear encounters if they can recognize the situation quickly enough and have sufficient information to execute escape maneuvers,'' <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. But the aviation industry has been divided on the value of the cockpit devices. Some experts note that the equipment is not a radar that would give advance warning of a shear. Instead, the system consists of sensitive equipment that calculates airspeed and other factors and tells a pilot when the plane is in the midst of wind shear conditions. Critics of the equipment have suggested that by then it may already be too late to fly through a microburst, especially if the plane is close to the ground, as in a takeoff or landing. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> rule also requires airlines to provide pilots with increased training on wind shear recognition and recovery procedures while using the new equipment. Pilots are divided as to how best to fly through a shear. Many insist that a powerful microburst such as the one that struck the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> plane in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> or the one encountered by a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> jetliner that crashed as it was taking off from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> in 1982 is virtually impossible to escape. The Pan Am crash left 154 people dead. The airlines as well as the pilots union have urged speedy development and installation of so-called Doppler radar at major airports so that shears can be detected in advance and pilots can maneuver around them or not depart. The first of 17 such Doppler radars are scheduled to be installed at airports between 1990 and 1992. About 30 additional radars would be installed at other airports later under an <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> contract scheduled to be awarded later this year. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> also have under way a five-year research program aimed at eventually developing a more advanced wind shear detection device for the cockpit that would be able to warn a pilot in advance when it is about to encounter shear conditions.

<HEAD>House Panel Approves Sanctions Over Use Of Poison Gas Against
Kurds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Brushing aside <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration objections, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> approved on Thursday legislation imposing sanctions on <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> for its alleged use of poison gas `` against Kurdish insurgents and unarmed Kurdish civilians.'' The committee acted after senior Republican members told administration officials that there is strong bipartisan support for the measure in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and urged them to reconsider their opposition. One official, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Burley </PERSON>, deputy assistant secretary of state for <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> Affairs, told the panel the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration believes the sanctions legislation is ` ` premature'' and `` counterproductive'' because it is likely to undercut intense diplomatic efforts aimed at preventing the future use of chemical weapons by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> `` I am very disappointed in the statement that you read,'' said Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Broomfield </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Mich </LOCATION>., the panel's senior <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> member `` A lot of effort has gone into making this a bipartisan effort. I think this is a very measured response and I think the administration will see when it hits the floor the large bipartisan support it will have.'' Unlike sanctions legislation approved earlier by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> resolution does not accuse <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> of waging a war of genocide against the country's Kurdish minority. And the sanctions it would impose, at least initially, are generally less severe. The resolution declares that the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> army has destroyed Kurdish villages in northern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and adds: `` Substantial evidence exists that the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> army has been using chemical weapons against Kurdish insurgents and unarmed Kurdish civilians.'' It calls that `` a gross violation of international law.'' In a series of initial steps, the resolution would prohibit government-to-government or commercial arms sales to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> as well as sensitive high technology items. It authorizes the president, after consultation with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, to take a series of other punitive actions against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> including barring Iraqi exports, including petroleum products, from entering the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, barring or restricting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, denying <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> financial credits or financial guarantees and opposing loans to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> by international financial institutions. The resolution authorizes the president to waive any or all of the sanctions if he certifies to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is not using chemical weapons in violation of international law, that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has provided `` reliable assurances'' that it will not use chemical weapons in the future and that it is willing to permit on-site inspection by impartial observers. The committee approved the measure on a voice vote after acting to include a prohibition against the export to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> of any chemical that might be used to produce chemical weapons and to authorize the president to bar the sale of an entire steel plant in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee's action follows the issuance on Wednesday of a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> staff report based on interviews with more than 200 of the 65,000 Kurdish refugees who fled into <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> following the alleged poison gas attacks on their villages by <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> aircraft. The report concludes that `` overwhelming evidence exists'' that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> used chemical weapons against the Kurds and that hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people likely were killed. The only committee member to oppose the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> resolution was Rep. <PERSON> Toby </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, R-Wis., who said that while the use of poison gas is `` despicable,'' sanctions against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> will only hurt <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exporters But Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilbray </PERSON>, D-Nev., said that to do nothing is unacceptable `` If we do n't do something we are going to have tell our own children and grandchildren that we sat by while an entire people was exterminated,'' he said. <PERSON> Burley </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is encouraged by a recent statement by the foreign minister of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> which he said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats interpret as meaning that `` there will be no future use of chemical weapons.'' Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, D-Calif., told <PERSON> Burley </PERSON>: `` I am intrigued by your logic which looks at a criminal act, sweeps it aside and takes the word of a criminal that he will not take criminal actions in the future. <PERSON> Burley </PERSON> replied: `` We believe enacting these sanctions now will lessen our influence ... We do not believe that sanctions now would bring us closer to the objective we both share, ending the use of chemical weapons by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>.''

 A federal judge Thursday granted a defense request for a hearing on whether Iran-Contra prosecutors could re-indict former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> if charges filed here were dismissed. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> scheduled an Oct. 6 hearing on a motion by independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> to dismiss five criminal charges against <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> so that prosecutors could seek a new indictment from a federal grand jury in nearby <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. Lawyers for <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, who is charged with helping direct a secret arms supply network for the Nicaraguan rebels in defiance of a congressional ban on such aid, urged the judge to dismiss the case altogether rather than give prosecutors a chance to bring fresh charges The dispute stems from <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>'s refusal to waive his right to be tried in the <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> on charges that he lied about his role in the arms-supply network to his <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> superiors and to the presidential commission headed by former Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, that investigated the Iran-Contra affair. Four counts of the indictment alleging <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> obstructed the commission's work and made false statements charge the alleged offenses occurred at <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Langley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>.

 Seven days before the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hopes to return to manned space flight, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> lauded the `` seven heroes'' of the Challenger on Thursday and pledged, `` You can delay our long trek to greatness, but you can not halt it.'' Returning to the scene of one of his most emotional times as president, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told workers at the Johnson Space Center: `` Soon the world will be watching as five brave Americans lift off from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is going to space again _ and we are going there to stay.'' Three days after the Challenger blew apart on Jan. 28, 1986, little more than a minute after liftoff, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> went to the Johnson Space Center to console the relatives and friends of the seven crew members who died. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s worst space tragedy shook the nation and threw the space program into disarray. In a speech to <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> employees a week before Discovery's blast-off, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` Our early settlers knew great risks and made great sacrifices, but with their sacrifices, they moved the frontier forward and built a great nation. `` Neither can we stand still, nor be content, and we are not afraid,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` Ill fortune can slow us down, but it can not stop us.'' Upon his arrival in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was asked if he wanted to go up in space. `` I've been there for several years,'' the president chuckled as he climbed into his limousine. At the sprawling space center, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> greeted the five Discovery crewmen: commander <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON>, co-pilot <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Covey </PERSON> and mission specialists <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lounge </PERSON>, <PERSON> George </PERSON> `` Pinky'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilmers </PERSON>. The president was treated to a brief tour of a mockup of a space shuttle. The crew, clad in royal blue jumpsuits, led <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> up the stairs to peer through an open hatch in the two-story-high mockup of the shuttle. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, queried after his brief tour whether he wished he committed more money to the space program, replied, `` I've tried to do all that's possible. We've had some problems,'' he added, apparently referring to the Challenger tragedy. `` This program is the highest priority,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. The president then walked toward the end of the mock shuttle, where he addressed 8,000 to 10,000 <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> employees, contractors and their families, many of whom waved tiny <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flags under the bright <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> sun and roared their approval during <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s speech. At the end of his speech, <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON> presented <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> with a royal blue jacket and told him that the insignia patch from the Discovery mission would be flown into space with the shuttle crew and returned and presented to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at the end of the mission. Before meeting the astronauts, who are under a modified quarantine before their scheduled launch, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> underwent a medical examination in which he was pronounced free of any disease that could be easily transmitted. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s senior aides and <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> detail were required to complete medical data forms before they were cleared to enter the space center with the president. Only <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was to have direct contact with the astronauts. Next Thursday, the shuttle is scheduled to blast off from <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, on a four-day stay in orbit _ a mission that will include the launching of a $ 100 million communications satellite. The flight will be the first in 32 months _ a wrenching period in which <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> underwent a series of management and other changes, including a redesign of the shuttle boosters, emanating from a presidential commission's findings resulting from the accident. The tragedy was a monumental setback to the space program, which was the first to put a man on the moon and which had led the world in exploration after initially playing catchup with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in the late 1960s. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s space-center stop came on a day in which the president was making campaign appearances in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> for Republican presidential candidate <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Beau </PERSON> <PERSON> Boulter </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, who is trying to wrest Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s seat from him. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is running for both the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and the vice presidency under a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> law that permits such a dual candidacy. The president was wrapping up his campaign day by sharing the stage with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at a $ 1,000-a-plate fund-raising dinner for some 2,500 Republicans. In the Johnson Space Center pep talk, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said that `` when we launch the space shuttle Discovery, even more than the thrust of Discovery's great engines, it will be the inspiring courage of our heroes, and the hopes and dreams of every American, that will lift the shuttle into the heavens. And may the hand of God bring it safely back to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>.'' `` And when the Discovery takes off, seven precious souls will soar beside it, the seven heroes of the Challenger,'' he added. `` With their lives, they moved a nation, they summoned <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to reach higher still, as they wrote man's destiny into the stars.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> recalled how he had joined Americans in mourning the loss of the Challenger crew members `` one cold January day'' in 1986, and said: `` We are a nation born of pioneers, and we will always create our future on the frontier. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> can live no other way.''

<HEAD>House Panels Approve Banking Legislation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two House committees approved legislation Thursday that grants banks broad new powers to affiliate through holding companies with securities firms. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> and Judiciary committees, racing a deadline, approved amendments to a bill passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> last month. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> also has completed work on a separate measure. The Energy and <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, under Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., hastily approved amendments drafted by the panel late Wednesday night and early Thursday morning One amendment, which was being reproduced for members, arrived at the committee at 11:55 a.m. and was approved at 12:01 p.m. Nevertheless, <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> said in a statement after 23 committee members voted to send the measure to the floor, with only Rep. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, D-Tex., asking that he be recorded against the bill: `` The committee today restored balance and equity to the restructuring of the financial services industry `` The real winners today were the nation's depositors, investors and taxpayers,'' he said. `` If everyone with an interest in this legislation, both inside and outside the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, can come together in a spirit of harmony and compromise, it will be possible to work out a bill.'' Treasury Undersecretary <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> issued a statement expressing `` strong opposition'' to the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s action. It `` demonstrates that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> is not prepared to move forward into the modern financial world ... -LRB- and is -RRB- retreating into a protectionist, anti-competitive regime left over from the 1930s,'' he said. The administration favors the bank-securities bill passed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> because it permits banks to enter into a greater number of securities activities. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogilvie </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said, however, his organization is extremely disappointed by the action taken by the <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> committee. `` At a time when positive legislation is badly needed to modernize the banking laws so bankers can fully meet their customers' needs, the committee's action removes the only positive feature contained in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill _ new securities authorities,'' he said. `` Their action also makes the limited bank insurance authorities even more restrictive. If passed, the bill would be a dramatic step backwards for American consumers and <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. banking.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> also approved the measure after removing mandatory prison sentences for individuals who breach the so-called `` firewalls'' constructed between banking and securities functions, an amendment introduced by Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N </LOCATION>. The full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is expected to take up the measure next week. In his opening statement, <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> said any relaxation of the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act, designed to preclude virtually all securities activities by banks and their affiliates, `` must carry with it the creation of strong firewalls, functional regulation, and effective prohibitions against conflicts of interest in order to repeat the abuses which necessitated the creation of the Glass-Steagall wall.'' He said he believes his amendments do that. Among other things, the amendments would: _ Prohibit loans between banks and their securities affiliates to prop up a failing affiliate or purchase securities underwritten by the affiliate _ Strictly limit transfer of confidential customer information between banks and securities affiliates _ Prohibit illegal tie-ins so that all dealings are arms-length _ Prohibit a bank from stuffing its trust department accounts with unsound securities underwritten by its securities affiliate _ Prohibit shared name, premises, log and advertising _ Prohibit shared officers, directors and employees, with rulemaking authority to make exceptions for smaller banks

<HEAD>Sales Resume for 27,000 HUD-Owned Houses</HEAD>

 The government expects to sell about 2,500 single-family homes within the next couple of days, following a federal judge's decision lifting a three-week ban on such sales, federal housing officials said Thursday. More than 27,000 homes owned by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> went back on the market Thursday morning after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON> refused to issue a preliminary injunction in a suit by homeless advocates who say more of the government-owned houses should be made available to people living in the streets. Government lawyers argued that stopping the sales would bankrupt the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s home mortgage insurance fund. All of the houses were obtained after buyers defaulted on FHA-backed loans. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> had more than 47,000 such houses when <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON> issued a temporary restraining order Aug. 30, but about 20,000 of them were not affected because contracts already had been signed for their sale. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Nistler </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> deputy assistant secretary, said field offices around the country to expect about 2,500 sales contracts to be signed right away for the houses that were off the market since <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON> issued the order in a suit by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION>. Project lawyer <PERSON> Florence </PERSON> <PERSON> Roisman </PERSON> said Thursday that homeless advocates were `` deeply disappointed'' with the oon's resources. <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> also said it would be difficult to determine who was responsible for `` deficiencies'' in the bond's disclosure reports. He noted, too, that bondholders were already trying to recover their investments through a civil trial in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz </LOCATION>. In a 376-page report that brought to a close what had been described as the largest single investigation in <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> history, the commission's staff found that <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> tried to put the best spin possible on the construction and financial problems that led up to the default in 1983 and in some cases `` avoided disclosure of negative developments.'' Others, including the bond underwriters, bond counsel and the rating agencies, were n't agressive enough in asking questions and exercising `` due diligence'' to ensure that investors were aware of the supply system's mounting problems, the report said. The report, however, drew no legal conclusions. While taking no enforcement action, the commission decided to seek public comment on a proposed rule that would impose stricter disclosure requirements on issuers of municipal bonds and the securities firms that sell them. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s decision drew criticism from some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` It sends a message that if you mess up, mess up big because the principal regulatory agency does n't have the resources to pursue enforcement action,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON>, D-Ore. <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON> said the report `` dances around the key issues'' and he would ask Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, to hold a hearing on the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to drop the WPPSS <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, who had previously said it would be a `` outrage'' if the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> failed to act against those responsible for the default, said in a statement that his committee would look at the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s decision `` at the earliest possible time `` The decision to terminate the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> investigation without enforcement is not well received by the WPPSS bondholders or by me,'' <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> said. The report concluded that the default resulted from extensive cost overruns and construction delays at <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> Project No. 4 at the <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> nuclear reservation in southeastern <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state and No. 5 at Satsop, west of <LOCATION> Olympia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash </LOCATION>. Cost of the projects had soared from an initial estimate of slightly over $ 2 billion to almost $ 12 billion before construction was halted in 1981. Both projects were abandoned in January 1982 and in 1983 <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> quit making payments on the bonds after the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> held that the utilities' contracts with the consortium were illegal and thus unenforceable. Without payments from the 88 participating utilities, many in other states, <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> defaulted. As early as 1978, the report said <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> recognized it could face long-term financing problems. Top supply system officials told the 88 utilities participating in the projects in late 1980 that <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION>' `` cash flow coverage was so low that there was almost none at times,'' the report said. They warned that the projects might be terminated as a result of the cash flow situation. The report said the participants, also in late 1980, asked the supply system to study the possibility of slowing down construction or terminating the two projects. The request was kept confidential because of its possible impact on the financial markets and <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> continued to sell bonds, more than $ 400 million worth, before the projects were eventually scrubbed, the report said. The report found that <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> also failed to adquately disclose in the official bond statements that forecasts showed a drop in the demand for electricity in the Northwest.

 Small-town youths awed by easy money were used to build a major big-city drug empire in what a federal prosecutor Thursday called `` A Tale of Two Cities'' _ rural <PERSON> Marianna </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, and cocaine-infested <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. Cocaine, processed in `` cook-up houses'' by 14-year-old girls into crack, its smokeable form, was sold by boys, many under 16, in crack houses run by the Chambers ring, which once accounted for half of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s crack trade, prosecutors charge. Four Chambers brothers _ <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Marlowe </PERSON>, <PERSON> Otis </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> _ and 10 other people are on trial on federal charges including cocaine conspiracy, firearms and tax evasion counts. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> said in opening arguments that <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> came from <LOCATION> Marianna </LOCATION> in 1982 and built their empire on three secrets of success: recruiting, organization and discipline. <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>' first witness, former organization member <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Middleton </PERSON>, backed his descriptions of an expanding network of trusted lieutenants and child drug dealers, kept in line by a no-holds-barred `` wrecking crew or beat-up crew.'' Fourteen defendants, their attorneys, prosecutors and reporters outnumbered spectators in a small federal courtroom for the opening day of an expected six-week trial. Jury selection took four days. People passed through a metal detector to enter, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshals sat at both ends of the hallway in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s federal building. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Coonce </PERSON>, agent in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> office, had pledged tight security to avoid any possible reprisals against more than 50 government witnesses. Forty-one cars, including <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Cadillac </ORGANIZATION> and Jeep models; 250 weapons; $ 500,000 in cash and $ 500,000 in jewelry were seized in serving 107 search warrants that led to federal indictments, <PERSON> Coonce </PERSON> said earlier. Authorities described a drug ring that had as many as 400 employees, operated up to 300 crack houses and, at its peak in 1987, sold up to $ 3 million worth of cocaine a day. That ended with the indictments of 22 people in March. Four entered guilty pleas earlier and four remain fugitives. Defense attorneys, in their opening arguments, attacked <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>' case and `` Tale of Two Cities'' analogy, saying he is relying on shaky witnesses, many of whom are testifying to avoid prosecution for their own offenses <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, attorney for defendant <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON>, told jurors that by the time the trial is finished, `` You will be reading a different book: ` Much Ado About Nothing.''' <PERSON> Middleton </PERSON>, who was to take the stand again Friday, said she made money pickups for the organization for about six months under threats from <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> that the man she lived with would be hurt. She said she saw crack cocaine made and sold, saw organization members get paid up to $ 800 a week and saw people beaten who crossed the Chambers brothers. `` I got pulled into it. That's not me,'' said <PERSON> Middleton </PERSON>, who finally went to police and who testified in return for immunity from prosecution. She pointed out <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON> in the courtroom, identifying him as a `` wrecking crew'' member she knew as Fats. She said she once saw him carry a body out of an apartment building where the organization sold crack and put it in a garbage bin in a field across the street.

 A new survey released Thursday indicates that as many as 700,000 young American men may have at least 10 sex partners a year, putting them at `` considerable risk'' of sexually transmitted diseases including AIDS. The national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> reported that a survey of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sexual habits shows that `` most Americans appear to be at relatively low risk of infection'' with the virus that causes AIDS, acquired immune deficiency syndrome. `` However, a sizeable percentage of young, never-married men report more than 10 partners in the past 12 months,'' including 5 percent of those 18-29. The survey interviewed 1,481 people, asking them to write privately and submit anonymously their answers to four questions about their sexual habits. Three percent of the men interviewed reported five to 10 sex partners in the previous year. One in 100 reported more than 10 _ including 3 percent of the men between 18 and 29, 1 percent of the men 30-44 and 2 percent of the men 45-60. `` This is something that concerns us,'' said Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Darrow </PERSON>, a CDC AIDS specialist. `` You're talking about millions of people ... and we do n't know whether they're taking other kinds of precautions,'' such as discussing AIDS testing with partners and using condoms. Applied to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population, the survey indicates more than 700,000 single men aged 18-29 and more than 100,000 aged 30-44 may have 10 or more partners a year, leaving them `` at considerable risk'' of AIDS, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. AIDS is spread chiefly through sexual contact or the sharing of drug needles; persons with multiple sex partners are considered at increased risk for the deadly disease. More than 70,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cases have been reported, and federal health officials believe as many as 1.5 million Americans are infected with the virus that can cause AIDS. Overall, 22 percent of the respondents said they had had no sex partners in the previous year, and 60 percent reported only one partner. Eleven percent said two to four, 2 percent said five or more, and 6 percent did not answer the question. `` At least 80 percent seem to be at relatively low risk of infection'' from sex, <PERSON> Darrow </PERSON> said. People also were asked about the status of their sex partners _ their gender and whether they were spouses, friends, pick-ups or prostitutes. Six percent of the men and 1 percent of the women surveyed said at least one of their sex partners in the previous year was a `` casual date or pick-up.'' Well below 1 percent reported paying for sex. Of the men reporting sex in the previous year, 3 percent said their partners included males and another 6 percent did n't answer the question. Homosexual men make up the largest group of AIDS patients in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> researchers `` really did n't know what to expect'' from the survey, <PERSON> Darrow </PERSON> said, noting there have been no definitive scientific sexual behavior studies in recent years. The ground-breaking <PERSON> Kinsey </PERSON> report on sexual behavior is too unscientifically based and is 40 years old. The survey reported Thursday included adults living in households; prisoners and transients were not included, `` and they may be at greater risk,'' <PERSON> Darrow </PERSON> said. The survey was conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opinion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, a private center which has conducted surveys on social issues since 1972. The center receives funding from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, and shared its research with federal health officials, <PERSON> Darrow </PERSON> said. The survey was conducted between Feb. 14 and April 25. The margin of error varies from finding to finding, depending on a number of variables, but is believed to be less than 4 percent overall, <ORGANIZATION> NORC </ORGANIZATION> researchers said.

 Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> was stopped as he left the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday to hear an appeal from an Armenian dissident who wants to visit his ailing mother. <PERSON> Amvarsam </PERSON> <PERSON> Khlgatian </PERSON>, 61, had been waiting for two hours across the street carrying a placard that read, `` <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, Let Me Visit My Dying Mother,'' while <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> met inside with Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. As the motorcade started for the Soviet embassy, <PERSON> Khlgatian </PERSON> dashed into the street carrying his placard. The motorcade stopped and startled security agents wrestled Khlgatian to the ground. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> left his limousine to talk to the demonstrator for a few minutes. `` He said, ` Do n't worry, I ` ll take care of it','' <PERSON> Khlgatian </PERSON> said afterward. `` But he can do nothing. It's up to the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Khlgatian </PERSON> said he made a similar appeal to <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> a few months ago `` and he said the same thing.'' The protester said he was exiled from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1979 after serving 15 years in labor camps for attempting to escape to the West. He said he works as a machinist in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Khlgatian </PERSON> gave <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> a leaflet in which he described his mother as 80 years old and fatally ill. It said General Secretary <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, despite promises of humanization, had kept him from visiting her in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, the Armenian capital. `` For me, no matter who was and who is on the top, there was n't and is n't justice on the bottom,'' the leaflet said It concluded with an appeal for help.

 Tanks and troops rolled into two southern <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> republics Thursday where protesters in an ethnic dispute attacked a prosecutor's office, rallied by the hundreds of thousands and staged strikes. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> Perfiliev </PERSON> told a news briefing in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>: `` The situation is not improving. It has become even more threatening.'' Authorities imposed a 9 p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew in <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>, the main city of the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> region, center of the dispute between Armenians and Azerbaijanis that's been going on since February. Violence in the region this week killed one person and hurt 48. Protesters, who want the area to be taken from <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> and made part of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, attacked the city's prosecutor's office in <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION> Thursday. `` There are soldiers on every street, at every crossroad, checking passports and personal cars,'' said a man who answered the telephone at the state radio and television office, Gostelradio, in <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, in the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>, was virtually at a standstill and sealed off because of ethnic tension. In <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, capital of the Armenian republic, about 700,000 people flooded the streets for a three-hour rally Thursday night despite heavy presence by police and thousands of soldiers, said resident <PERSON> Arpine </PERSON> <PERSON> Popoyan </PERSON>. The Foreign Ministry closed <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> to foreign journalists Thursday, a day after barring travel to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. It gave no reason. Asked the mood of Armenians, Mrs. <PERSON> Popoyan </PERSON>'s 17-year-old son, <PERSON> Vahagen </PERSON>, replied: `` Fighting.'' Dozens of tanks and armored personnel carriers were deployed and soldiers guarded government and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> buildings in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Popoyan </PERSON> said by telephone. `` It's very tense. Everyone is at the edge,'' she said. She said several deputies of the Armenian Supreme Soviet, the republic's parliament, agreed at Thursday's rally to push again for an emergency session to renew demands to annex <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. A rally was set for Friday and Armenians vowed to pursue their general strike until they get an answer, she said. Armenian authorities on Wednesday refused to hold such a session. State-run television showed armored personnel carriers in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> and said similar measures were taken in 16 other areas of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> with a `` mixed population,'' apparently meaning areas where both Armenians and Azerbaijanis live. <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> has a population of 3.4 million. The official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said a strike that began in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> Sept. 16 spread to three other towns and an entire district of the republic. An editor for <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s official news agency, Armenpress, who demanded anonymity, said food stores were open in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, but public transportation was not working and many people were on the streets. <PERSON> Perfiliev </PERSON> said one man was killed and 48 people were hurt this week in clashes in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, which has been part of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> since 1923 despite its historical links to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and mostly Armenian population. He said the dead man and 32 of the injured were Armenians. The other casualties were Azerbaijani. Perfiliev reported beatings, mauraudings and more than 30 buildings burned down. <PERSON> Perfiliev </PERSON> blamed it on `` corrupt elements'' trying to distract attention from <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms. `` Such a situation, of course, can not be tolerated ...,'' he said. `` The alternative was to take urgent and tough measures.'' In <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>, a city 1,000 miles south of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, dozens of uniformed police manhandled Georgian nationalists Thursday when they tried to protest near the site of a U.S.-Soviet citizens conference. Activists said at least 15 demonstrators were detained. Although <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION> was under a curfew, most people stayed home voluntarily because they feared more violence, said the man at <LOCATION> Gostelradio </LOCATION>, who refused to give his name. Mrs. <PERSON> Popoyan </PERSON>'s husband, Armenian activist and former political prisoner <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Popoyan </PERSON>, said from <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> that soldiers patrolling <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION> had permission to search houses at will. Mrs. <PERSON> Popoyan </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION> residents, kept from going out on the streets, shouted from their windows in protest Wednesday night. The man at <LOCATION> Gostelradio </LOCATION> said food stores, the newspaper and radio and television stations were operating, but public transportation, schools and most workplaces in <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION> were closed. He said no demonstrations were held because of a ban and few people were on the streets. The Armenpress editor said protesters rallied Thursday morning in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, but `` there is n't any disorder, and there wo n't be.'' Radio <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> said protesters attacked the regional prosecutor's office in <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>, but did not say when `` There were also arson attacks. Several cars were put on fire. Shooting was heard in several places. These and other illegal activities claimed casualties. Law enforcement agencies took steps to put an end to mass-scale disorders,'' it said. Tension rose markedly in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> after a shoot-out Sunday in <LOCATION> Khadzhaly </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>, killed one man and wounded at least 25 people.

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government on Thursday banned a national anti-apartheid conference planned for this weekend, and a fourth activist took refuge in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consulate </ORGANIZATION> after escaping from detention. Organizers had depicted the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> conference as one of the most important anti-apartheid gatherings in 30 years. More than 70 groups, with members ranging from black militants to liberal white Parliament members, had planned to discuss strategies for countering repression of dissent. The ban was part of a crackdown on opposition. Earlier Thursday, authorities backed off in the case of the latest escape by a detainee, who joined three other anti-apartheid activists holed up at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Consulate. Police issued, then withdrew an arrest warrant for <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> Ngcobo </PERSON>, who escaped Wednesday while being treated at a hospital and fled to the 11th-floor consulate in a downtown <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> office building. Consular officials allowed <PERSON> Ngcobo </PERSON> to remain while his case is assessed, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Zavis </PERSON> said. The consular officials earlier provided refuge for three prominent activists who escaped Sept. 13. <PERSON> Zavis </PERSON> said he could not confirm reports that the consulate turned away a fifth fugitive Wednesday night. Local news reports said a black man sought by police was refused entry into the consulate and later was taken into custody under security legislation. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Thursday that the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION> given refuge agreed not to have contact with news media as a condition of their staying. This was so the consulate could continue normal operations and avoid activities incompatible with diplomatic activity, he said. Black activist <PERSON> Winnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> visited the consulate Wednesday and complained that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials would not let the detainees contact reporters. Police pledged not to arrest the three initial escapees if they leave the consulate, but Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> confirmed that a multipronged crackdown against other activists is under way. Across <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, more than two dozen activists were detained or barred from political activities this week, offices of anti-apartheid groups were raided, and pedestrians and motorists in urban centers were subjected to random searches. Brig. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mellet </PERSON>, spokesman for <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON>, announced the conference ban. He said one goal of the conference was to promote disruption of upcoming nationwide municipal elections. Activists advocate a boycott of the elections, saying the segregated black council seats at stake are components of a white-controlled system that excludes blacks from central government. <PERSON> Mellet </PERSON> said participants in the conference were sympathetic to the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement and were seeking to fill the vaccuum created by the banning in February of 17 major anti-apartheid groups. The groups included the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a nationwide coalition. The crackdown comes during an upsurge of bombings, including five in a 9-hour span late Wednesday and early Thursday. Authorities said 38 people were injured, including 18 whites at a <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> bus terminal and 19 blacks at a disco on the other side of the city. The disco owner said three white men left shortly before the blast without drinking their beer. Police have blamed most recent bombings on the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>. But activists believe right-wing vigilantes or a covert security force unit carried out the recent bombing of a <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> building used by anti-apartheid groups. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Ngcobo </PERSON>: `` He indicates that he is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and had been in detention for five months prior to his escape. He is now in temporary refuge with the three other ... activists.'' The three are <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> <PERSON> Morobe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Valli </PERSON> <PERSON> Moosa </PERSON>, leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> UDF </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Vusi </PERSON> <PERSON> Khanyile </PERSON>, chairman of the banned <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crisis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

 Troops fired live ammunition and plastic bullets to put down widespread Palestinian demonstrations Thursday, including an attack by masked, ax-wielding youths. Twenty-four Palestinians were wounded, Arab hospital officials said. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> escaped injury during a tour of the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> town of <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON> when a Palestinian assailant hurled a chunk of cement from a nearby rooftop. Soldiers rushed to the site but made no arrests. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said mass arrests of grass-roots activists in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> succeeded in curbing large-scale riots, but added: `` Have we succeeded in bringing stone throwing to a standstill? Not yet.'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said he did not see the rock hurled Thursday but said about 80 percent of the violence in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> involved stone-throwing. Also Thursday, the army said four soldiers would face trial in the beating death of an elderly <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> man, <PERSON> Khader </PERSON> <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarazi </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>'s Jabaliya refugee camp. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said they were to be charged with manslaughter. It said the soldiers struck the man with clubs after they broke into his home Aug. 22 to arrest Palestinian youths suspected of throwing stones. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, dozens of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> youths marched through the casbah, or market, chanting anti-Israeli slogans, waving <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags and holding pictures of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, an army spokesman said. The youths wore Arab headscarves wrapped around their faces and garbage bags over their clothes to hide their identities. They attacked troops with rocks and axes. Soldiers responded with plastic bullets and live ammunition, an army spokeswoman said. Sixteen Palestinians were wounded in the clash, including a 12-year-old shot in the right hand and two 16-year-olds hit in the stomach, officials at <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>' <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ittihad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> said. They said four other Palestinians were wounded in clashes in villages near <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. Other Arab hospital officials said four Palestinians were wounded in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, including a 13-year-old boy who was shot in the chest and rushed to <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hashomer </LOCATION> hospital in serious condition. Acording to the army and to a military spokesman, 11 Palestinians were wounded in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> and nearby <LOCATION> Burka </LOCATION> village and three were wounded in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, including one listed in serious condition. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> credited the use of plastic bullets against stone throwers for a recent upsurge in casualties and said they reduced violence in the territories. According to army orders, troops can fire plastic bullets at the legs of stone throwers even if soldiers' lives are not in danger. Unlike live ammunition, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials say plastic bullets are not generally lethal when fired at a distance of 20 yards or more. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> also said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would never relinquish control over the occupied territories to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> before peace negotiations as demanded by <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> last week in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. `` I would like to clarify that all the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> talk about the possibility that some international entity will come here is mere chatter,'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said. A think tank, the independent <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, on Thursday reported 191,700 Jews live on captured <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> land, about two-thirds in Israeli-annexed Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. After the 1967 war, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> occupied the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and annexed Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Also Thursday, six Americans whose passports were seized by the army for allegedly participating in an anti-Israeli demonstration said they refused to submit to Israeli questioning. `` We have neither committed or been charged with a crime,'' said one of the Americans, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Doares </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. A Foreign Ministry official said the six, who are on a tour sponsored by a pro-Palestinian lobby group in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, were `` very active'' in an illegal demonstration in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>. The Americans contend they were observing a march by <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> women from a distance when their passports were seized Monday.

 Democrat <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told a <LOCATION> Silicon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> audience Thursday that the Republicans' `` do-nothing trade policy'' has left the American military dangerously dependent on imported computer parts. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration turned its back while competitive American businesses such as semiconductor manufacturers were `` devastated by unfair competition,'' the vice presidential candidate told employees of the <ORGANIZATION> Intel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, one of the nation's premier producer of computer chips `` This administration talks tough on national defense ... but their do-nothing trade policy has left us dependent on <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for 40 percent of the computer chips used in our own weaponry,'' he said. `` I'm here to tell you that a Dukakis-Bentsen administration will not rest until strong, competitive American companies like <ORGANIZATION> Intel </ORGANIZATION> have an equal opportunity to compete around the world,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. `` There is one clear difference in this election: <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> support a trade policy for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' With <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> back in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was campaigning for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s 47 electoral votes which both sides consider crucial to winning the White House on Nov. 8. The area near the <ORGANIZATION> Intel </ORGANIZATION> plant voted for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> over his <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> challenger, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>, in 1984 by a margin of 58 percent to 41 percent, but <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was warmly welcomed in the crowded plant cafeteria. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator also delivered the same warning that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> gave in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> _ that the <ORGANIZATION> Bush-Quayle </ORGANIZATION> ticket will try to use Social Security funds to reduce the federal budget deficit if elected in November. Over the past eight years, the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has `` waged unrelenting warfare against Social Security,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said, calling it `` guerrilla warfare'' in a later appearance in <LOCATION> Everett </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>. And he urged the 300 workers outside the <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> plant in <LOCATION> Everett </LOCATION> to watch Sunday's debate because `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is n't going to be able to duck the issues any more `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> does n't get to vote very often,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> Intel </ORGANIZATION> employees. `` But one of the few votes he cast -LRB- as vice president -RRB- scored a direct hit on Social Security benefits for your parents and some of you.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> cited the occasion in May 1985 when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, presiding over the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> as vice president, cast the tie-breaking vote in favor of freezing cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security benefits. `` They can wrap themselves in the flag, but they ca n't hide from the truth on Social Security,'' he said. `` As <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, facts are troublesome things.'' He also accused his <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> counterpart, Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, of voting against programs benefiting the elderly. If the Republicans are elected, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said, `` man the barricades and get a firm grip on your Social Security care'' because <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will `` make a run at the benefits.'' Democrats `` will never tamper with the system or loot the trust fund,'' he said.

 The presidential campaigns of Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Thursday settled their squabble over the composition of the panel of journalists for their Sunday night debate. <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Debates </ORGANIZATION>, a group set up by both major political parties to organize the debate, said the agreement was reached early Thursday evening. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehrer </PERSON> of public television's `` The McNeil-Lehrer Report'' will serve as moderator for the Sunday showdown in <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. The panel of three journalists will be anchorman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Groer </PERSON> of The Orlando Sentinal and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mashek </PERSON> of The Atlanta Constitution, she said. The camps have not yet resolved who will serve on the panel for the second debate next month in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. The resolution came a day after the two camps agreed that the candidates will use lecterns of different heights for the debate.

The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> camp said that would be unfair to print journalists and it submitted to the commission a list of 10 reporters it said it would accept as members of the panel. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> announced that it will broadcast the debate on a delayed basis. The network's 122 affiliated stations will show the debate in its entirety at 11 p.m., following regular Sunday night programming.

 Leftist rebels lifted a crippling transport ban on Thursday, then killed at least 15 soldiers in an attack on an army post with mortars and catapult-launched dynamite, officials said. Eleven guerrillas were killed and 11 soldiers were wounded in the attack in eastern <LOCATION> Morazan </LOCATION> province, according to a communique issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. The raid lasted two to three hours and appeared to be one of the most successful guerrilla operations in recent months. Marxist-led rebels of the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> have fought the the U.S.-backed centrist government for nearly nine years. About 65,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed. Lt. <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said the attack began at 1 a.m. -LRB- 3 a.m. EDT -RRB- with rebels firing mortar rounds and charges of <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION> into a communications post on <LOCATION> Avocado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> Corinto </LOCATION>, 120 miles northeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, spokesman for the 3rd Army Brigade, spoke by telephone from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miguel </LOCATION>, headquarters for military operations in the eastern third of this small Central American country. He said the rebels used catapults, similar to those used in medieval times, to launch explosives into the base defended by about 50 men. The guerrillas then attacked with rifle fire, he said. The raid began an hour after the end of a guerrilla-imposed road traffic ban that paralyzed most transportation nationwide since Monday. In lifting the ban, the rebels called on supporters to step up sabotage of vehicles that ignored the measure. The guerrillas also stepped up sabotaging power transmission lines in several of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s 14 provinces. Bus and truck traffic returned to normal during morning rush hour. The rebels' clandestine <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Venceremos </ORGANIZATION> said the ban _ the fifth this year _ was lifted as of midnight Wednesday. At least three vehicles were burned during the ban, which reduced bus and truck traffic in the capital by about 70 percent. Traffic on provincial highways was almost completely paralyzed. Some buses and trucks that operated since Monday covered their license plates trying to avoid reprisals. The guerrillas blew up about 35 utility posts or high-tension wire towers after the transport ban began, military sources said. Four eastern provinces were without electricity early Thursday because of overnight sabotage.

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, claiming there is no longer any need to `` match the Soviets bullet for bullet and tank for tank,'' said Thursday he would work on reordering <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conventional defenses if elected. The `` Competitive Strategies Initiative'' would involve using conventional weaponry `` in new ways,'' put heavy emphasis on naval forces and use high technology to deploy and mobilize conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, aides said. Democratic rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has made beefed-up conventional forces a cornerstone of his campaign. Aides said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s comments, at a $ 3.1 million <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> fund-raiser in which he shared the stage with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, could pave the way _ under certain circumstances _ for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troop reductions in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in the future, although <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not automatically favor such a reduction. And one senior campaign adviser, speaking only on the condition of anonymity, said that elements of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s so-called `` Competitive Strategies Initiative'' would be embraced by the outgoing <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and announced within the next few days by <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>. `` It marks a change in the way we utilize forces, using conventional weaponry in new ways,'' the official said. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, here to help <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presidential candidacy and to raise money for the party, said Democrats `` use our words and borrow our tune but the song is way out of key.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said prevailing <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> views on national defense would make two prominent late Texans _ President <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Rayburn </PERSON> _ `` shake their heads in wonder and confusion.'' Serving as a warmup speaker for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of flip-flopping on such questions as support for the B-1 bomber. Without mentioning <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' name, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told 2,500 <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> faithful that `` we believe in a national defense that defends our shores and our allies by land, air and sea _ and very soon, space, through the Strategic Defense Initiative.'' `` But the opposition wants to reduce the size of our <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, right at a critical moment when the Soviets are building up their naval presence in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in particular, reiterated his call for a 600-ship <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides said the candidate's new defense proposal, likewise, would put heavy emphasis on naval forces. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, here after a brief foray into <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' backyard to collect the endorsement of a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> police union, discussed his defense proposals without getting into specifics. He said in prepared remarks his Competitive Strategies Initiative would be `` based on the idea of putting our strengths against our competitor's weaknesses.'' He said the initiative had been under study for two years in the `` Reagan-Bush <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>.'' He said he would make the program, and working on it with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies, `` a high priority in my administration.'' The plan is based on `` existing weapons systems and those we have in the pipeline now,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` It is designed to ensure that we need not match the Soviets bullet for bullet and tank for tank,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. In general, the proposal involves using high technology systems for mobilizing and deploying forces, principally for the defense of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in the wake of the new U.S.-Soviet treaty to eliminate intermediate-range nuclear missiles, aides said. Asked if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s remarks could suggest a movement toward reducing the number of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Alixe </PERSON> <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> said, `` it could. It could mean there would be less emphasis on that.'' However, she said that the initiative did not automatically mean that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> favored such a reduction. And <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s foreign-policy adviser, said that the proposal `` is simply a new management process for spending our money smarter in new weapons systems of the future.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would detail the proposal in the weeks ahead. In the speech here and in an earlier address to <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> activists and college students on the campus of <ORGANIZATION> Baylor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Waco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> accused the Democrats of moderating their views on national security issues in response to public opinion polls. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and Democratic running mate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> had adopted his and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s issues. `` You'll hear them say there are no disagreements between them and us about these bedrock principles,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` But it just does n't sound right. They use our words and borrow our tune, but the song is way out of key.'' The joint appearance by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was their second since <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was nominated as the Republican presidential candidate in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> last Aug. 17. The pair appeared together at a rally in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> a week later. During the Waco speech earlier, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> seemed to be poking fun at the attempt in recent weeks by the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign to burnish the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor's defense credentials, particularly the decision to have <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> don a helmet and pose in a military tank. `` Lately, some liberal leaders have seen what was happening to them in the polls and had a death-bed conversion,'' he told some 9,000 cheering students and others in the <ORGANIZATION> Baylor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> athletic center. `` They'd have you believe that they're born-again <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Pattons </PERSON>. But if we go the way they want to go, our defenses will run out of gas in no time.'' Gen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Patton </PERSON> was a renowned World War II combat hero.

 A tearful 19-year-old woman hugging a stuffed animal broke down on the witness stand Thursday while testifying that a group of men took turns raping her on the hood of a car as she tried to resist. `` I was screaming and telling him to stop,'' she said Thursday of 23-year-old <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, the first of 10 men indicted in the case to stand trial. `` He was holding my legs. I was trying to push him off.'' <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> is being tried in <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Duval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> on a charge of sexual assault. He also faces a charge of aggravated kidnapping. Later during her testimony, the woman was overcome with tears and said she was about to faint. Counselors from Crisis Services of <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION> escorted her from the small courtroom packed with a standing-room-only crowd of about 150. She resumed testifying Thursday afternoon, and faced cross-examination by defense attorney <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Pena </PERSON>, who is attempting to show that the woman was involved in an affair with the defendant and was a consenting sexual partner that night. The woman testified she had never been romantically involved with <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> asked the woman if she was drunk the night of the alleged gang rape, and she responded that she drank only half a beer. <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> asked why she waited several hours to report the incident to the police. `` Because we did n't have a phone and I did n't know where to go,'' she said. `` How many other times did <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> rape you?'' <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> asked. She testified earlier that <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> had raped her at her house three days before the gang rape, but that she had been afraid to tell anyone, including her husband. The woman, a mother of two, said the gang rape began while she walked a short distance home from a relative's home about midnight on March 26, after her husband had gone to a party. During the walk, she said, she declined to `` go riding'' with <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> and three other men indicted in the case, and, `` They grabbed me and pushed me in the car.'' She said <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> and the others were her neighbors in this <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> town of 5,000 people. The men took her north of town, outside a shed where an illegal cockfight was taking place, the woman testified. The woman said <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> stayed in the back seat with her and forced her to perform oral sex on him, while the others went to see the roosters fight. `` I was trying to pull myself up, but I could n't because his hands were real heavy and he was pushing me down,'' she said. After that, she said <PERSON> Corando </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> walked back to the car and told <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, `` to save him some.'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, 26, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, also faces sexual assault and aggravated kidnapping trials in connection with the alleged gang rape. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> pulled her head by the hair and forced her to perform oral sex while he stood outside the car, she said. Then she said he climbed in the back seat and told her, `` You're going to like this,'' before forcing her to have anal intercourse The woman named at least two other men who she said took turns raping and and sodomizing her simultaneously. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Briones </PERSON>, 29, also facing a sexual assault charge, only fondled her, she said, because he was impotent. <PERSON> Briones </PERSON> testified for the prosecution ealier in the trial, and was offered a recommendation for probation in return for his testimony.

<TEXT>
 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> came to his rival's back yard Thursday to accept the endorsement of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrolmen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s largest police union It was the second visit by the Republican presidential nominee to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> this month. The vote was viewed by Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as `` personally devastating,'' according to the attorney for the union. As <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> planned a hasty counter-rally outside his governor's office at the <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> visited a restaurant in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and criticized <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as being soft on crime `` Who was it said that the police are n't there when you need them?'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as he stood flanked by some 50 patrolmen, all of them elected representatives of the police union. `` I'm here to receive this endorsement but also to make it clear that I'm the one in this race who wants to strengthen law enforcement,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the room full of reporters, about 150 supporters and police. `` Our first priority must be to keep the criminals away from the people who want to live in peace and safety.'' Two hours after the mid-day rally, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> surrounded himself with scores of law enforcement officials, top elected officials and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said: `` We're here today to investigate a felony: assault and battery on the truth. `` What <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is doing to the truth in this campaign is a crime. We're here to give <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> what <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> Friday used to ask for: the facts, ma'am, just the facts.'' The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> rally stemmed from a 51-0 vote by elected officers of the patrolmen's association Wednesday to endorse <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for president. It was not the first time the union has endorsed a Republican. In 1980 and 1984 the association supported <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and in 1984 it endorsed Republican <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamie </PERSON> in his unsuccessful <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bid against <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> himself, in a conversation with union attorney <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> McGee </PERSON> on Wednesday afternoon, said according to <PERSON> McGee </PERSON> that the union endorsement would do him great harm. `` I hope these guys realize that if they go ahead and do this, that I would regard this as personally devastating to me,'' <PERSON> McGee </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as saying. In his rally Thursday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said that unlike <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, he supports providing federal assistance to local law enforcement agencies. And <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> countered criticism of his past support for furloughs for first-degree murderers by saying that the Reagan-Bush administration last year gave some 16,000 furloughs, some as long as 40 days, to convicted drug pushers. Patrolmen's Association President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Guiney </PERSON> told the crowd at the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> rally that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` is no friend of police.'' `` During his term as governor, he has presided over a revolving door criminal justice system,'' <PERSON> Guiney </PERSON> said. `` We are ever mindful of his total opposition to capital punishment, especially in view of our recent tragic loss of three outstanding officers who paid the supreme sacrifice in the line of duty.'' One of the patrolmen also criticized <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' absence in the past year from the funerals of those three officers killed on the job. Earlier this month <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> to spotlight what he called <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' tolerance of delay in cleaning up polluted <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been endorsed by the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the state district attorneys and the 14 county sheriffs, two of whom are Republican. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has also won the endorsement of a number of out-of-state law enforcement groups. The <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> police force is the largest in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> as is its patrolmen's union, which has 1,621 members. Endorsements are made by 54 patrolmen who are elected representatives. Of those, 51 attended the Wednesday night session and all voted for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.

 Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> touted his endorsement by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' hometown police union Thursday, prompting <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to surround himself with other law officers and accuse his rival of `` assault and battery on the truth.'' `` What <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is doing to the truth in this campaign is a crime,'' the Democratic presidential nominee said in perhaps his strongest attack on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to date. `` His administration has waged not a war on crime, but a war on crime programs.'' The sharp rhetoric came three days before <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> were to face each other in the first of their two nationally televised debates _ confrontations that both sides consider crucial. The bipartisan commission on debates announced Thursday that <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehrer </PERSON> of public television's <ORGANIZATION> MacNeil </ORGANIZATION> @ Lehrer NewsHour would be moderator Sunday in <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, and panelists would be <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Groer </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> Sentinel and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mashek </PERSON> of the Atlanta Constitution. And an <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> poll released Thursday showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> essentially tied, with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 45-41 lead softened by a 2 point margin of error. The lead for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was lower than the 47-40 recorded for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> last month, and the survey of 2,630 likely voters found he had lost support among <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Democrats, going from 35 percent to 25 percent. Furthermore, half the respondents thought <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was a bad choice to be <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate. Meanwhile, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was back on the campaign trail for his vice president in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, scorning `` born-again <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Pattons </PERSON>'' who say they support a strong national defense. It was an apparent reference to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who spent last week sounding hawkish as he laid out his defense policies and rode in a modern M-1 tank. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> spoke to students at <ORGANIZATION> Baylor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Waco </LOCATION>, then was joining <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at a big fund-raising dinner in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also stressed defense issues and hinted that the administration was on the verge of unveiling a new strategy for the defense of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> with conventional weaponry. Without offering specifics, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that what he called the `` Competitive Strategies Initiative'' would be `` based on the idea of putting our strengths against our competitor's weaknesses.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has offered what a `` conventional defense initiative'' to counter the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration emphasis on Star Wars. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> traveled to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> to pick up the endorsement of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrolmen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a 1,500 member union. `` I'm the one in this race who wants to strengthen law enforcement,'' declared <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` My opponent is strongly out of the American mainstream on issues such as fighting crime.'' Although <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has won the backing of other police groups in his state and in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s adopted home state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, a spokesman for the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> police group said its members felt <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would be more attentive to law enforcement needs than would the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Guiney </PERSON>, president of the association, called <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` no friend of police.'' He cited <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' opposition to the death penalty, his support for a former program granting weekend furloughs for convicted felons, and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' failure to attend funerals for three police officers recently. However, it was not the first time the union has endorsed a Republican. In 1980 and 1984 the association supported <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and in 1984 it endorsed Republican <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamie </PERSON> in his unsuccessful <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bid against <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>. The visit was <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s second to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> as the Republican presidential nominee. Earlier this month he denounced <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for failing to clean up pollution in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> responded a few hours after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke today with a rally _ scheduled hastily in hopes of blunting the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> endorsement _ on the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Statehouse steps. The governor was surrounded by police officers from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and eight other states. He declared <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a `` fugitive from the truth'' who has shamelessly portrayed himself as a crimefighter and advocate of the environment, education and elderly. He was joined by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, who accused <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of pandering. `` I'm tired of the simplistics and the distortions by people like the vice president,'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' counterpunch overshadowed his only previously planned event of the day _ an appearance at a senior citizens center where he accused <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of trying to harm Social Security. Accompanied by his 85-year-old mother <PERSON> Euterpe </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> blasted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for a 1985 vote against cost-of-living increases for Social Security recipients. He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> once described Social Security as `` largely a welfare program.'' `` When election time rolls around, Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> likes to say he is a great friend of older Americans,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` Maybe he thinks we all have amnesia.'' Democratic running mate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> campaigned in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Silicon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration turned its back while industries such as semi-conductor manufacturers were `` devastated by unfair competition. `` This administration talks tough on national defense ... but their do-nothing trade policy has left us dependent on <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for 40 percent of the computer chips used in our own weaponry,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. In other developments: _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides said their campaign will spend a modern record on television advertising The campaign plans to spend 60 percent of its $ 54 million budget _ or $ 32.4 million _ on television ads. _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> chief of staff <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> complained to a high-level <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> official about drug-money laundering during a visit five years ago But <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not discuss it with <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> strongman Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. He commented on a British television documentary quoting a former senior aide to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as saying <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had complained to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> about money laundering. That assertion is counter to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s contention that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration took action against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as soon as it learned of alleged drug activity

 Hurricane <PERSON> Helene </PERSON>'s winds strengthened to 110 mph in the <LOCATION> mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> on Thursday, but forecasters said the storm was still no threat to land. At 10:30 p.m. EDT, the center of the 250-mile wide storm was at latitude 14.1 north and longitude 44.3 west, or about 1,020 miles east of the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Barbados </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Helene </PERSON> was moving west-northwest at 10 mph and was expected to continue that track and speed through Thursday. `` This is a very good hurricane _ it's already something to reckon with,'' <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> forecaster <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> said. `` But the currents suggest it is going to turn to the north _ it's just too early to speculate.'' Air currents from a low pressure trough over the ocean may draw <PERSON> Helene </PERSON> northward into the open <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>, away from the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> islands and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Helene </PERSON> showed signs of northwest movement by late Thursday. But if it heads into the eastern <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, islands could be affected by early next week, said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>. In the meantime, <PERSON> Helene </PERSON> was growing stronger and more organized as it moved westward across the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> from its spawning grounds near the the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> off the African coast. <PERSON> Helene </PERSON> is the eighth named storm of the 1988 Atlantic hurricane season. Storms become hurricanes when sustained winds reach a minimum 74 mph. Of the season's three previous hurricanes, <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> swept across the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, killing hundreds, but the other two, <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Debby </PERSON>, caused only minor damage in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>.

 Government soldiers rounded up 10 people from this village, accused them of collaborating with leftist rebels and killed them with grenades and rifle fire, relatives and neighbors said Thursday. The killings Wednesday in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, a tiny farming town 30 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, appear to constitute the biggest mass slaying of civilians in this war-ravaged country in four years. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> reported earlier Thursday that 10 `` subversives'' were killed Wednesday just outside <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. It said troopers of the <ORGANIZATION> Jiboa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Battalion </ORGANIZATION> `` surprised a group of extremists of the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> who were moving through the area.'' It described the confrontation as `` fierce combat.'' Marxist-led rebels of the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>, have fought <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON>'s U.S.-backed centrist government for nearly nine years. But more than 10 witnesses to Wednesday's incident interviewed by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> said there was no combat and that the 10 men and women killed had been taken from their homes or detained as they carried out chores or walked along village paths on errands. Several of those interviewed by the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> were detained along with most of the village's inhabitants in the local schoolhouse. They said the three women and one of the men killed were taken from the schoolhouse and marched about a mile to a ravine where six other village men were detained. Three explosions, presumably grenades, were heard at about 3:30 p.m. Wednesday, followed by a steady fusillade of rifle fire, the villagers said. Local residents were prevented by the troopers from going the place of the killings Wednesday evening. The villagers found the bodies early Thursday morning. An officer at the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, asked about the villagers' version of events, said the armed forces had no further information to modify its earlier report. But the officer, who declined to give his name, said the matter would be investigated. The 10 bodies were covered while still in the ravine with a banner proclaiming a slogan of the leftist guerrilla group. Villagers put the bodies in hammocks Thursday afternoon and carried them to the local churchyard, where relatives mourned their dead. Some of the bodies were disfigured by explosions or shrapnel. Relatives identified the victims as: <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Argueta </PERSON>, 47; <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Zoila </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON>, 45; <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Sibrian </PERSON>, 27; <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfaro </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nicolas </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfaro </PERSON>, <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfaro </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ulises </PERSON> <PERSON> Sibrian </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Atilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Zepeda </PERSON>. The ages of the men were not known. <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> Argueta </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Atilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON>' common law wife, said five <LOCATION> Jiboa </LOCATION> troopers arrived at the family's adobe house at 5:30 a.m. Wednesday. She said they searched it thoroughly, then took her husband away and ordered her to remain inside with the couple's three children `` They said they were going to give him a talk, that they did that whenever they went into a village,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Argueta </PERSON>, her eyes red from crying, told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> in the churchyard. Mrs. <PERSON> Argueta </PERSON> is also the sister of <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Argueta </PERSON>, one of the slain women. <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Gumersinda </PERSON> <PERSON> Melendez </PERSON>, 28, said she and her daughter, <PERSON> Blanca </PERSON>, were walking to the nearby town of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sebastian </LOCATION> when they were detained by the troopers at 6:30 a.m. The two said they were held in the schoolhouse all day with about 35 of the village's approximately 70 residents, including about a dozen children. At mid-afternoon, the soldiers called the names of Ms. <PERSON> Argueta </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Sibrian </PERSON> along with those of <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfaro </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Emilia </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON>. The five stepped forward, were blindfolded and led out, they said. <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Emilia </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> that she was released outside the schoolhouse, apparently because the soldiers realized they wanted <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Zoila </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON> instead of her. The women said the soldiers had a list of names from which they appeared to be working. They said different soldiers who addressed the detainees in the schoolhouse accused the villagers of supporting the front. <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Emilia </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> she believed she was being led out to be killed when she was taken from the school. `` They called us collaborators -LRB- of the guerrillas -RRB-,'' she said. `` I do n't feel safe here anymore. I would like to leave, but I do n't have anywhere to go,'' she said. `` I feel a great fear about staying here,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Argueta </PERSON>. The last mass killing of non-combatants attributed to the army took place on Aug. 30, 1984 in the town of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vueltas </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Chalatenango </LOCATION> province. Thirty-four civilians were killed there, according to local and international human rights groups. No officer or soldier was prosecuted for that atrocity.

 President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> canceled on Thursday his scheduled visit to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> because the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government delayed visas for about two dozen members of his delegation, a government official announced. `` This arbitrary and illegal attitude constitutes a denial of Nicaraguan rights,'' Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> said in making the announcement at a news conference. On Wednesday, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s U.N. Ambassador <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON> <PERSON> Caldera </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was blocking visas for most Nicaraguans who wanted to attend <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s speech to the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, including <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s wife and children. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Rudi </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> said he was not aware of <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s cancellation of the trip. `` We have not seen those reports yet,'' he said. Asked if the visas might be expedited to allow the trip, <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> said, `` I could not say.'' A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> earlier denied the administration was blocking or delaying the visas. Earlier this month the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> criticized the leftist <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> government for refusing to allow the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to replace Ambassador <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> and seven other diplomats the Sandinista government expelled on July 11. The Sandinista government accused the diplomats of trying to destabilize the country. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in turn expelled Nicaraguan Ambassador <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Tunnerman </PERSON> and seven of his colleagues. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> family members, his doctor, chief of protocol and many of his senior advisers were among the 22 to 25 Nicaraguans whose visas were not processed in time for the Sept. 28 address, <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON> said. The Sandinista government protested `` the unjustified delay'' in issuing the visas, according to a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> communique broadcast over state-run radio Wednesday night. It said <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s representatives to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> and the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had been instructed to `` intercede before the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> so that without major delays the visas in question are granted.'' The statement said the state of U.S.-Nicaraguan relations should not be a factor in the issuance of the visas. `` In adopting this type of attitude, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> clearly ignores those commitments it has assumed as the host country of international organizations, specifically violating existing stipulations in the agreement between the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> relative to the site of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> statement said. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> told the Nicaraguan mission that <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> and some senior Nicaraguan officials would have received their visas in time for their scheduled arrival Friday, <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON> said on Wednesday. But he said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> also told the Nicaraguan Mission that the other 22 to 25 visas would not be decided until Oct. 4, a week after <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> was to speak to the 159-member <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since 1981 has supported rebels seeking to overthrow <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Sandinista government. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> has said that in addition to refusing replacements for <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> and the seven other expelled diplomats, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> is not issuing visas to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats assigned to replace envoys being routinely reassigned or to personnel seeking to visit the embassy on official business.

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Rebellious soldiers wound down their purge of repressive army commanders Thursday but continued hunting henchmen of the deposed <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> dynasty, independent radio reports said. The new military government of Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Prosper </PERSON> <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> appealed for an end to the lawlessness that began over the weekend, when a coup toppled Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> and sent him into exile in the neighboring <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. A military communique carried on state television said: `` Formal instructions have been passed on to the forces of order to arrest all individuals committing acts of brigandage and pillaging.'' It said violators would be `` duly tried and punished.'' The army announced retirements or discharges of 29 officers, most of whom were removed by rebellious soldiers. Radio Metropole, meanwhile, said staff at the army general headquarters issued a 16-point declaration demanding elections, higher pay, medical benefits, subsidized housing and commissary privileges. It appeared the unit was speaking for itself, although their demands reflected sentiments expressed earlier by enlisted men who carried out the coup Saturday night. <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haiti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inter </ORGANIZATION> reported that soldiers hunted for members of the <ORGANIZATION> Tonton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Macoutes </ORGANIZATION>, who have long terrorized the population. The Tonton Macoutes were the dreaded private army of <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON>'s regime and that of his son, <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON>. The 29-year <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> dictatorship ended when the younger <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> was forced into exile in February 1986. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>, the former army adjutant, assumed the presidency early Sunday. Since then, rank-and-file soldiers nationwide have revolted against their commanders, depositing them handcuffed outside army headquarters in <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION>, the capital. <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haiti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inter </ORGANIZATION> reported the ouster Thursday of two more commanders _ in southwestern Cotes de Fer and the northern port of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marc </LOCATION>. That brought to 21 the number of commanders who served under <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> known to have been forcibly removed. Capt. <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> <PERSON> Ravix </PERSON>, commander of the 40-man <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marc </ORGANIZATION> barracks and reputed Macoutes sympathizer, was ousted one day after soldiers fired on demonstrators there, killing a 12-year-old boy and wounding three people. The Cotes de Fer commander was not identified. <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haiti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inter </ORGANIZATION> said that after <PERSON> Ravix </PERSON> was arrested and brought to <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION>, soldiers launched a hunt for <ORGANIZATION> Tonton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Macoutes </ORGANIZATION>. The High Command on Thursday night announced the retirement of 26 officers and the discharge of three others, most of them already forced from command. <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Desmangles </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, was removed by underlings. <PERSON> Tele-Haiti </PERSON> said the asssistant minister of immigration also was removed by lower-ranking personnel, but his name was not reported. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Degraff </PERSON>, the government's assistant director of information, said removal of unpopular officers was proceeding peacefully. `` The ouster movement should cease very soon,'' <PERSON> Degraff </PERSON> said. `` Loss of control ... is still possible, but I have seen an improvement in the situation.'' Sporadic nighttime gunfire continued and there were reports of more reprisal attacks, but for the most part the capital was calm Thursday. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>'s country retreat in Foret des Pins outside <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION> was among the houses reported pillaged. `` What is happening now could mean the possible elimination of Macoutism,'' <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Bajeux </PERSON>, a leading human rights activist and a center-left opposition leader. `` Now we can construct democracy. Soldiers are asking for justice, law and order under the 1987 constitution.'' <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> suspended the constitution, which was approved by 99 percent of the voters in a referendum in March 1987. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> said democracy was `` the ultimate goal of the military.'' On Monday he named a new Cabinet of 11 civilians and one military man, but has never mentioned restoration of the constitution or elections. Dr. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Roy </PERSON>, founder of the <ORGANIZATION> Haitian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> and co-author of the 1987 constitution, said he thought the political situation remained dangerously unsettled. He said the purge of Macoutes under way now should have happened when <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> was overthrown. `` Macoutes were not punished then; they were encouraged by the government,'' he said. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> headed a junta that promised a transition to democracy. However, independently run general elections Nov. 29 were thwarted when armed thugs supported by soldiers killed at least 33 people at polling stations. <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON>, a civilian, was elected president in January in military-run balloting that was boycotted by leading presidential candidates amd marred by widespread irregularities. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> ousted him in June.

<HEAD>U.N. Chief Says Peace In South-West Africa Closer Than Ever</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said Thursday that independence is `` closer than ever'' for <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The territory, commonly known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, is <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s last colony and has been ruled by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in defiance of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> resolutions. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> arrived early Thursday on his first visit to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> since 1983 to discuss recent regional peace initiatives which have revived the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>'s 10-year-old plan for Namibian independence. `` We are closer than ever to a solution to the problem,'' the Peruvian diplomat said at a cocktail party after a day of talks with Namibian and South African officials. `` We hope that in the very near future you will have next to our country a sister republic, the republic of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>,'' he said. Earlier, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> met for more than two hours with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>. Both emerged to say progress had been made. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> was host of the subsequent reception, attended by more than 200 guests of all races at a former presidential residence in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>. `` I would be kidding you if I said the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> was a popular concept in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> told <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> at the reception. `` But it is a privilege to have you here.'' <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has agreed to end its 73-year rule over <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> and allow <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observers to oversee the transition to independence, but only if the estimated 50,000 Cuban troops in neighboring <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> withdraw. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has agreed in principle to withdraw its troops, but there is dispute over the timetable. U.S.-mediated talks involving <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, aimed at setting this timetable, are to resume Monday in <LOCATION> Brazzaville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION>. Most opposition parties in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> rejected an invitation by <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> to come to <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> for consultations, but members of the territory's transitional, multiracial Cabinet met with him for more than an hour Thursday. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> was scheduled to meet President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> on Friday, then travel to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> for talks with leaders of its Marxist government.

 House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> denied Thursday that he revealed anything classified when he criticized a covert <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> operation in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, while Republicans pressed for formal ethics and intelligence investigations of the speaker's remarks. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, who has become a lightning rod for Democrats on <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> policy, found himself again embroiled in controversy for his revelation two days earlier that the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> had instigated demonstrations aimed at provoking the leftist <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> government and sabotaging peace talks with the Contra rebels.

 The House on Thursday passed election year anti-drug legislation that would severely punish recreational users and murderers alike, but it could face constitutional tests if enacted into law. The 375-30 vote is not the final word on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' latest effort to respond to Americans' fears over drug abuse. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> still must consider its own anti-drug legislation, and a conference will likely be needed to reconcile competing versions. Despite constitutional concerns, even by sponsors, the tug of election-year politics was so strong that <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members appeared willing to enact the toughest possible bill and let the courts decide the legal questions later.

 The number of giant profitable corporations that legally paid no federal income tax was cut by more than half last year, according to a new study, but backers of the landmark 1986 tax overhaul said Thursday the figure may never drop to zero.

Some of the 16 disputed the report. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Huard </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION>, criticized the report for what he called `` this horror-story type of argument.''

Defense attorney <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said the government's case is really `` for the birds.'' <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> told the jury that the government would seek to prove `` solely by circumstantial evidence'' that the birds came from <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. The attorney said the defendants are breeders who were only moving the birds from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to Marathon in the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION> when they were arrested. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> received a distress signal from a boat in the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Straits </LOCATION> on April 3, which led to the discovery of a boat at Matecumbe Key with the birds aboard. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents said correspondence on the ship, including a letter from a woman asking to buy `` a girdle, size medium, that I need very much to go out,'' showed the boat had been in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>.

Each defendant is charged with three felony counts, one of conspiracy to violate the Lacy Act and two counts each of violation of the act itself.

 Born out of wedlock to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> GI and a Welsh woman during World War II, <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> McGlade </PERSON> for years knew only her father's name and one clue _ as a small boy, he had lived in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. As a teen-ager, she would visit <LOCATION> Stratford </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s birthplace, on the infinitesimal chance that some American tourist might mention her dad She wrote to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senators, government officials and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, and after 14 years of searching, she found him in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> McGlade </PERSON> now helps others less lucky, heading one of two British groups that help hundreds of `` war babies'' look for their roots. Often equipped with little information, they face tight privacy laws, intransigent bureaucracies and the lingering stigma of illegitimacy. Some give up; most say they can not. `` You're always told, ` For God's sake do n't tell anybody your father was an American,''' said Mrs. <PERSON> McGlade </PERSON>, 43, whose father left <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> not knowing her mother was pregnant. `` I kept it quiet for my mum's sake.'' But after she founded War Babes, she says she got hundreds of phone calls from people saying, `` I'm the same as you. I'm looking. The group now has 300 members. The Birmirk.'' Well, that's not the only reason. `` I wanted to go to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> so my son could play golf down there,'' she adds. `` Those were the major points. However, I love eccentric character roles, and they do n't come around very often. Fortunately, I have finally reached an age -LRB- 51 -RRB- when I can do them and not worry about any of that -LRB- glamour -RRB- stuff anymore.'' <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> plays the mean superintendent of an orphanage in `` The New Adventures of <LOCATION> Pippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Longstockings </LOCATION>,'' based on the popular children's stories. `` I love meanies, and this goes back to Capt. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> in ` Private Benjamin.' You know why? Because they have no sense of humor. People who are mean or unkind or rigid _ think about it _ can not laugh at themselves If we ca n't laugh at ourselves and the human condition, we're going to be mean.'' Amazingly, <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> can laugh, this despite a 1982 auto accident that broke both her legs and made her face look like, in her former husband's words, `` E.T. on a pillow.'' Months and months of plastic surgery followed, along with two sessions in the <ORGANIZATION> Betty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> because of her addiction to painkillers. The recovery lasted four years, and now her face shows no evidence of the ordeal. Nor does her spirit, even though she has also undergone a masectomy. Her humor remains wickedly offbeat, but she also speaks about serious matters, too. Such as her work for Mothers Against Drunk Driving -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> MADD </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-. The Los Angeles-born <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, was educated in convent schools, then studied at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dramatic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Her first Broadway show, `` Little <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Sunshine </PERSON>,'' lasted two years, then she toured in `` The Miracle Worker'' for two years. She was a member of the original company of `` Hello, Dolly'' when producer <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Lear </PERSON> spotted her and cast her for a comedic role in his film `` Divorce, American Style.'' She followed with a series of eccentric characters in `` The Cheap Detective,'' `` The Sting,'' `` Murder by Death,'' `` Scarecrow,'' `` At Long Last Love'' and `` The Last Picture Show.'' <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> recently came to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> from her <LOCATION> Ojai </LOCATION> horse ranch to make spot announcements for <ORGANIZATION> MADD </ORGANIZATION>'s Drive for Life Day on Sept. 3, `` which happens to be my birthday.'' Her feelings about drunken driving stem only partly from her accident. `` Four years before, I had stopped drinking; I went to A.A. -LRB- Alcoholics Anonymous -RRB-,'' she said. `` Goldie -LRB- Hawn, her close friend and ` Private Benjamin' co-star -RRB- and I had n't had anything to drink over dinner. -LRB- The driver who hit her on a badly lighted street -RRB- had n't had anything to drink.'' Having experienced what can happen on the streets even to sober people, <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> feels strongly about those who drive under the influence. Two recent films infuriated her. `` I never would have seen ` License to Drive' except that my dear friend <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> is in it,'' she said. `` My sons and I just sat there stunned by the lack of conscience that would propel people to do this. Why? `` We walked out after my friend <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, one of the writers of ` Private Benjamin,' did a drunken driving scene, singing wonderful old <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> songs. People were laughing, they thought it was so funny. I looked at my sons and we stood up and walked out. `` I have n't seen ` Arthur 2 On the Rocks.' I was offered the part of a social worker, and I really wanted to work with <PERSON> Dudley </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>. I read the script, in which -LRB- <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Liza </PERSON> <PERSON> Minnelli </PERSON> -RRB- wanted to adopt a baby, and the social worker was all for it. `` I said to the producers, ` People's consciousnesses are raised now. Do you think you're going to get away with this? No woman worth her salt would give a child or encourage a couple to adopt a baby if there is alcoholism in the family. I'm an adult child of alcholics, so I know what I'm talking about.' `` I had to walk away from that job. And I could have used that money, too.''

 Standing in front of a big, circular barn near <LOCATION> Hancock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, the Rev. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Turpee </PERSON> described how the Shakers, a small, close-knit Christian community, considered round barns more efficient in farming. `` The efficiency of the Shaker barn meant that there would be more time to worship and serve God,'' said <PERSON> Turpee </PERSON>, an American Baptist minister from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, in the opening scene on a new interfaith cable TV network, <ORGANIZATION> VISN </ORGANIZATION>. Vision <ORGANIZATION> Interfaith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Satellite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> started operations Monday, the country's first broadly ecumenical network involving a wide spectrum of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> religious traditions. To begin each day of broadcasts, network co-host Turpee, or a woman colleague still to be named, will offer a short description of some religious group that has made an impact on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> life. The network's initial fare also represented a combination that planners say will be standard _ music, dramas with ethical points, call-in talk shows, documentaries and magazine-type exploration of issues. `` We're providing programs of a morals-faith kind that has been at the core of our country's whole value system, but which largely has not been on national television,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Wilford </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bane </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. Bane, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> and the network's interim general manager, said, `` It's going to broaden the perspective and give a more rounded picture of what religious life is all about. Even `` for viewers without strong religious convictions,'' he said, it will provide `` entertaining and throught-provoking alternatives to ordinary television.'' With 10 major multisystem cable companies under agreement with the network, it has a potential of reaching 18.5 million households, but initially was estimated available to only about 6 million households. This was expected to grow toward the higher mark, and beyond, as local systems adjust channel assignments. Start-up financing has come through the cable industry, whose fees are expected to cover the central operational budget of about $ 6 million annually. Denominations initially are footing most production costs, however foundation gifts and commercial advertising are expected once the number of subscribers is determined. The new network has rules against any soliciting of money or proselytizing. Launching of the network came at a time many cable systems were seeking replacements for programs of scandal-tainted televangelists such as <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>. The Rev. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON>, an Episcopalian and board chairman of the network, said most religious television lately has emphasized `` personal pietism exclusively slanted toward a narrow perspective.'' It `` gave a distorted image of American religious life,'' he said. <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON>, rector of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s richly endowed <ORGANIZATION> Trinity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> where the new network has offices, said it will reflect historic faiths that have been `` the backbone of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' Besides mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, Greek Orthodox and Jewish bodies the network also involves such groups as the Mennonites, <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, Seveneth-day Adventists and Mormons. `` For the first time we have an example on television of the way religion ought to work in a democracy, with tolerance and respect,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baskin </PERSON>, the network's director of faith group relations. Although <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops decided against using the network, participation was voted by the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Syndicators </ORGANIZATION>, including church orders and institutions active in TV production. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON>, communications officer for the Church of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> of Latter-day Saints -LRB- Mormons -RRB-, said <ORGANIZATION> VISN </ORGANIZATION> will offer `` top-quality, values-oriented programming,'' appealing to a `` broad spectrum of viewers.'' The network's program director, <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>, a Presbyterian, corralled a varied composite for opening week, ranging from dramas produced by Seventh-day Adventists to magazine shows produced by Roman Catholics and Lutherans. At the outset, broadcast schedules were limited to five hours on weekdays, 1 p.m. to 6 p.m. -LRB- EDT -RRB-, and longer on weekends, from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Saturdays, and 6 a. m. to 5 p.m. Sundays. Children's shows have a big place only on Saturdays, along with weekend Bible study shows, dramas and worship. The network expected to expand to a 12-hour daily schedule by the first of the year, including prime evening time. The Rev. <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> <PERSON> Caliandro </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> and the network's director of program development, predicted the network will be reaching 30 million households within two years Besides denominationally produced programs, he said the network acquires programs from other producers, and also will produce programs itself, with some now in planning stages with various academic institutions, including: Programs on biomedical issues with the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, on world religions with <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>, on everyday ethical problems faced by Americans with <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, and on interdisciplinary viewpoints with Notre Dame.

<HEAD>Export Labor a Main Source of Foreign Currency for Philippines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIGUEL C. SUAREZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 With jobs scarce at home, so many Filipinos have gone to work abroad that they have become one of their country's main sources of foreign currency and a key factor in keeping the economy going. Hundreds of thousands leave each year and many of them are trained workers who take jobs far below their capabilities because of the higher pay abroad. Teachers, for example, work as maids overseas because the wages are much higher than a teacher's salary at home. Even so, President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> calls these export workers the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> `` new heroes.'' The estimated 1.5 million to 2.5 million overseas contract workers remain a steady source of income for the country's faltering economy Overseas workers sent home $ 791.9 million in 1987, making them the country's third largest source of foreign exchange after exports of electronic components and garments. <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> figures indicate that foreign-worker remittances for the first half of 1988 totaled $ 419.3 million. The money does n't go directly to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> government but the government benefits by its flowing into the economy. In general, the workers send some of their foreign wages home to their families. The families exchange the foreign currencies at banks or other financial houses for <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> pesos. The foreign currencies then circulate through the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> financial system. The currencies might be purchased by a <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> importer, for example, to buy foreign goods or by the government to pay off part of the nation's foreign debt. <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Achacoso </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Overseas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> POEA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, says 450,000 workers with contracts approved by his agency left for work abroad last year. That does not include uncounted thousands who leave without seeking help from the <ORGANIZATION> POEA </ORGANIZATION>. Those with <ORGANIZATION> POEA </ORGANIZATION> approved contracts included 60,000 maids, some of whom left skilled professions in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> to work as domestics abroad. <PERSON> Achacoso </PERSON> said the exodus has left shortages in some key skills at home. Shipping companies, for example, say they have problems finding skippers for ferry boats in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> archipelago as well as crews for domestic oil and chemical tankers. Nurses are also in short supply, `` and pretty soon, we might have a shortage of computer experts or programmers,'' Achacoso said. But Achacoso denies there has been a `` brain drain,'' and he said the foreign exchange earnings outweigh the disadvantages are. `` You ca n't speak of a brain drain because most of these people do not have jobs here,'' he said. `` Those who were employed here and left, simply opened up positions for the unemployed here.'' President <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> told Filipino maids in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> last April that overseas workers helped reduce the unemployment rate to about 9 percent and if they had remained at home, `` you could have been part of that statistic.'' The worker exodus began in the mid-1970's when <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> oil countries hired thousands of foreigners to build roads, office buildings, hotels and homes and to manage new development projects. Even though the oil boom has faded, the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> remains the major destination of Filipino workers. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> alone employs at least 300,000 of them as nurses, office clerks, public transport drivers, janitors and as private servants. Families of overseas workers often are the only ones with money to build homes or buy new appliances in rural areas. But overseas workers sometimes suffer abuses. `` The problems are with those who go there as tourists,'' he said. `` The moment their visas expire, they are open to a lot of abuses, and they can range from rape to being forced into prostitution, non-payment of salaries and being beaten up.'' <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Catequista </PERSON>, a 31-year-old accountant, recently applied for a job abroad with <ORGANIZATION> POEA </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'd like office work _ clerical, bookkeeping, anything,'' he told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He added that he had earned 2,500 pesos -LRB- $ 125 -RRB- a month at a local bank until it closed in 1985. He has since been earning about the same amount selling encyclopedias because he can not find a steady job. <PERSON> Josefina </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahilga </PERSON>, 38, who trained as a teacher, took a job as a maid abroad after she could not find a teaching post and ended up earning 2,000 pesos -LRB- $ 100 -RRB- a month rolling cigarettes in a tobacco factory. As a maid in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, she earns the equivalent of $ 450 a month plus free board and lodging and has seen much of the world. Before coming home on for a six-month leave, she joined her German employer on a family ski vacation in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>. Others cite reasons beyond economics for working abroad. `` It's always the money _ and going to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said a former X-ray technician who works as a maid in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. `` They always think it will be easier to get to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from -LRB- other countries -RRB- than from the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>More `Hang-the-Expense' Cars in 1989</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 European automakers must think this is the year for you to take the plunge on that sports car with enough horsepower to achieve Earth orbit or on the luxury barge with faucets for red and white wine in the back seat. They're offering more models than ever before, 40, that get caught by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> `` gas-guzzler'' excise tax, according to the annual fuel economy ratings released by the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday for 1989 models. Five cars bearing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> names are also taxed. Two of them are largely made in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and are aimed at the same hang-the-expense market segment that the Europeans are going after. The other three are the only entirely <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> models ever to pay the tax, which they also paid in 1987 but escaped last year. As usual, the Japanese are the mileage champs. For the fourth straight year the fuel-stingiest cars are the Japanese-made Geo Metro, formerly the <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION>, and the two-seater <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> Civic CRX HF. The <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION>'s mileage was 53 miles per gallon in the city, 1 mpg below last year's figure for the same car, and 58 on the highway test, the same as last year. <PERSON> Geo </PERSON> is the new nameplate <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is putting on the imports of its Chevrolet division. The Civic's figures are identical to last year's: 50 mpg city, 56 mpg highway. The gas-guzzler tax, unique to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, assesses a penalty in the form of an excise that rises with declining fuel economy. It starts at $ 500 and goes up to $ 3,850. It was enacted in 1975, when fears of fuel shortages were rampant, and aimed at discouraging the unthrifty. In all, 45 models _ some of them identical except for trim _ are official gas-guzzlers. Last year's list included only 24, and the year before that the count was only 18. This year's includes five Rolls-Royces that escaped in previous years through a now-closed loophole that exempted cars of more than 6,000 pounds gross vehicle weight. European models that will pay the tax come from Rolls and its <LOCATION> Bentley </LOCATION> badge, plus Maserati, <ORGANIZATION> Ferrari </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Porsche </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Aston-Martin </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Volvo </ORGANIZATION> and BMW. The proliferation of guzzlers reflects a growing desire for performance and status, analysts say. `` Around here it's almost a status symbol to have paid a $ 3,000 penalty tax,'' commented <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> <PERSON> Stasse </PERSON>, auto editor of The Register in <LOCATION> Shrewsbury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, in affluent <LOCATION> Monmouth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. `` If you have a car in your lineup that does not live up to its performance image, you're in more trouble today than if you have an official gas-guzzler,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a senior editor at <ORGANIZATION> Ward </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automotive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publications </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Ditlow </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, an advocacy group that frequently has opposed relaxation of government fuel standards, said: `` We are going in the wrong direction. We ought to be headed the other way and making gas-sippers.'' But manufacturers, he said, `` think they'll make more in profits than they pay in penalties.'' `` The tax really is n't objected to by the buyer'' of luxury cars, said <PERSON> Kyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Cadillac </ORGANIZATION> division. `` It does not alter <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s commitment to stay away from the gas-guzzler tax on U.S.-built cars.'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> was commenting on the <ORGANIZATION> Cadillac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allante </ORGANIZATION>, a $ 50,000-plus two-seater introduced last year to compete against the upscale Europeans. A larger engine this year brought it under the tax with a rating of 15 mpg in the city and 23 mpg on the highway, adding $ 650 to the sticker price. The other taxed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> entry is one model of the Chrysler TC by <PERSON> Maserati </PERSON>, which had readings of 17 and 21. Other TC models escape the tax, but not the one with the turbocharged 2.5-liter engine -LRB- 152 cubic inches -RRB- without the top-gear lockup feature on the three-speed automatic. This car is built in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> using many U.S.-supplied components. The Cadillac Allante is built in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> using an Italian body. The other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> gas-guzzlers are the Chrysler Fifth Avenue and its identical twins, the Dodge Diplomat and the Plymouth Grand Fury. They get 16 mpg in the city and 23 mpg out of town, according to <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, compared with 17-23 last year and 16-21 in 1987. Repeat tests of the same car can yield slightly differing results. `` The car has not changed,'' said <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Cervone </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. The Fifth Avenue family is in its last year. Successors were introduced last year: the <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yorker </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynasty </ORGANIZATION>, rated at 18 mpg city and 26 mpg highway for 1989. In all, Japanese and Korean manufacturers captured the top 10 spots, as they did last year. Because Japanese-owned plants in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> have in the past supplied the same cars to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market simultaneously, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> no longer lists the top domestic models. But the top U.S.-manufactured car from a Big Three company appears to be a Ford Escort recorded at 32-42. The biggest guzzlers this year are four Aston-Martin sports cars new to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, all 8-11 and carrying the top penalty of $ 3,850.

<TEXT>
 CBS might as well come on the air Saturday night and announce, `` Hey, Bonehead! The Olympics are on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>! Why are n't you watching!? Instead, the network offers a remarkably lame study in the obvious, `` Bodywatching,'' based on the <ORGANIZATION> Desmond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> books on body language. Did we know that the facial expression for joy is the same in every culture _ a smile? Did we know that hands express emotion? Did we know that hello is good-bye reversed? OF COURSE, WE DID! WE'RE NOT STUPID! GET TO THE SEX! The special actually reveals _ stop the presses _ how men's bodies are different than women's But this is network television, so do n't expect to see the good parts. `` Bodywatching'' starts off by examining the body language of door-to-door salesmen. Rap pleasantly on the door, one vacuum merchant suggests to another. Talk your way in the door. Make the vacuum cleaner look easy to use. This is scientific? Eventually, `` Bodywatching'' slinks up to the subject it constantly suggests, first with a woman who designs brassieres. She says her job is not unlike designing a suspension bridge. `` You have to somehow get the bust up!'' `` Push-up bras create curves that are highly sexual!'' gushes narrator <PERSON> Burgess </PERSON> <PERSON> Meredith </PERSON>, whose body language is thankfully unseen. On to a beach in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> _ hairy chests, string bikinis. `` Simply put, it's really about mating!'' <PERSON> Meredith </PERSON> squeals. For some reason, much of the first half of the special is taken up with following a blind sculptor to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> where he gets to feel <PERSON> Michelangelo </PERSON>'s masterpiece, `` <PERSON> David </PERSON>.'' This is rather, er, touching, but it does n't seem to have much to do with body language. `` Remember, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> is blind!'' <PERSON> Meredith </PERSON> exclaims irritatingly several minutes into the piece. Apparently the writers think the viewers are, too. The best body language for `` Bodywatching'' is turning the channel.

 If these are really the best young comedians of today, standup comedy is doomed. <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION> has scraped together a `` Twelfth Annual Young Comedians Show,'' airing Sunday and Sept. 30. Past installments boast a number of finds: <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Leno </PERSON>, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Reubens </PERSON> -LRB- Pee-wee Herman -RRB-, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and <PERSON> Louie </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, among them. This time around, even host <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> is n't in particularly fine form. The only standout of the five comics he introduces is the closing act, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeni </PERSON>, and he is n't particularly special. His bit about fighting in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is pretty funny _ it takes 40 minutes to actually work up to violence, after various stages, such as determining the opponent has a problem, as in, `` You got a problem? Hey, what's your problem, man?'' <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Radman </PERSON> trots out an old bit about crossing the Canadian border for a gig only to get into a confused argument with a border guard who thinks she said `` Canadian'' instead of `` comedian.'' If <PERSON> Radman </PERSON> does n't get some new material, there'll be no such problem. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Dillery </PERSON> has some decent material and a unique style. With his baby face and slight figure, he says he once tried to get a job in construction. `` The foreman looked at me and said, ` You can have the job. Just fill this out.' He handed me a shirt.'' <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>' litany of unhappy material _ he makes fun of a grandfather with facial paralysis, for pity's sake _ eventually sinks to dumb sex jokes interrupted line by line with his operatic singing. <PERSON> Haywood </PERSON> <PERSON> Banks </PERSON> is embarrassingly desperate to cram his mish-mash of material into a cohesive gimmick, so he dresses inexplicably like a nerd. He pushes far beyond its potential one bit in which he holds up a sign that says, `` This.'' `` Did you see this? Look at this! What's this doing on the floor?'' He follows up with `` That,'' `` Something'' and `` Nothing.'' Perhaps <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION> should consider doing a young comedians show every other year. Or every five years.

<TEXT>
 In the tumultuous days of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s cultural revolution, Grace King was exiled to the provinces to work on a farm. Today, her income is in the `` six figures'' and she owns an apartment on <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s fashionable East Side. Not surprisingly, she has no plans to return to her homeland. `` Going back would close off all our possibilities,'' Ms. <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. `` It would be too much of a sacrifice.'' Still, Ms. <PERSON> King </PERSON> remains a citizen of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, one of a growing number of Chinese who have chosen to seek their fortunes in American businesses and at American universities. Sons and daughters of high-ranking <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members, and even party members themselves, the Chinese came as students, part of <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>'s program of modernization. Some are taking jobs to round out their American education, gaining practical experience that will better enable them to contribute to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s development once they return home. Others have become enamored of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and have decided to settle here. The largest group af all, however, do n't know where they will end up, torn as they are between appreciation of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> freedom and ties to their homeland. Ms. <PERSON> King </PERSON>, 32, arrived in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> nine years ago from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. After graduating from <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> with a master's degree in business administration in 1984, she took a job with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> as an investment banker. Ms. <PERSON> King </PERSON>, the daughter of two high-ranking <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members, saw her family ripped apart by the ultra-leftist Cultural Revolution of 1966-1976. Her well-educated parents were purged from the party, lost their jobs and were kicked from their apartment. As part of Chinese leader <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>'s program that forced intellectuals to do physical labor, Ms. <PERSON> King </PERSON> herself was sent to the countryside to farm. During those years, she spent much of her spare time in political meetings, hearing harangues against the capitalism and imperialism of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s then-enemy No. 1, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But then came a rapprochement between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and educational opportunities in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> King </PERSON> jumped at her chance. `` I'm really happy that I came,'' she said in a recent interview. `` It gave me a chance to see a different world.'' Like many of her countrymen who've decided to stay, Ms. <PERSON> King </PERSON> says she's here for her career. `` In <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, advancement still does n't depend so much on talent and results,'' she said. `` There are other things, like your attitude, and your political ideology. I ca n't tolerate that.'' <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Orleans </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> scholar at the <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who is writing a book on Chinese students in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, estimates that at least 22,000 of the 62,000 who have come here as students since 1979 have decided to stay. That fact, he believes, prompted <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to consider slashing drastically the number of Chinese students allowed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Official Chinese documents seen in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in March indicated that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has debated cutting the number from around 18,000 in 1987 to 600. But those plans, it appears, have not been put into place. <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, an expert on the Chinese legal system and modernization drive, sees the mainland Chinese generation in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> as crucial to the country's modernization _ regardless of whether they return. `` These people will help their country no matter where they are,'' he said. `` It's difficult for a Westerner to understand the depths of their patriotism.'' In addition, he said, `` it's vital that the Chinese have people who know the practice as well as the theory'' _ and that is not only true in business. <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Quing </PERSON>, a 27-year-old postdoctoral fellow in physics at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, says the kind of experience he's getting would be unattainable in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` Experimental physics requires a lot of equipment and supplies, and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> just does n't have the resources,'' said Hu. `` Certainly if I go back I will disappear from the world of academia.'' Ms. <PERSON> King </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> say that even if they did return, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, a poor country with 1 billion people, would n't be able to use their skills. <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ting </PERSON>'s father, former Chinese Premier <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaoqi </PERSON>, was the main target of the Cultural Revolution and died imprisoned and alone in a hospital in western <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1969. Ms. <PERSON> Liu </PERSON>, 36, came to this country eight years ago and in 1984 became the first woman since Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was founded in 1949 to graduate from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` The Chinese leaders say they want us to give our lives to help the country grow,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Liu </PERSON>, 36, who works for <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>. `` But have n't we given enough? I can see compromising to help one's country, but never sacrifice.'' Ms. <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> says she plans on settling here. `` But I may change,'' she said. `` If <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> continues to open to the West, I may go back.'' <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> predicts that in the future, more Chinese will try to stay. `` First, the Chinese are just beginning to realize that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> does n't just throw people out of the country if they are here legally,'' he said. `` Even though their government is calling them back, the students are beginning to understand that they can stay anyway.'' The politcal crackdown and official warnings that followed a recent series of student protests calling for more democracy in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> make <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> `` look that much better,'' he said. Still, some students plan to return, among them <PERSON> Mei </PERSON> <PERSON> Shan </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Kissinger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> with degrees from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>. `` My generation is THE generation that can change <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Mei </PERSON>, 40, who spent eight years in Inner <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION> during the Cultural Revolution repairing farm machinery and now does geo-political risk analysis for the consulting firm. `` We are the only ones who know the country and have expertise. The younger ones, they may have more desire for democracy or fancy things, but they do n't really have the driving force. They did n't experience the Cultural Revolution so they have little understanding of bitterness For me, the bitterness has been my strength.'' <PERSON> Mei </PERSON> acknowledges he is taking a chance in going back to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` Sure I might not be able to do what I want to do,'' he said. `` But not being in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, even now, I somehow feel guilty.''

<HEAD>Inflation Stays At 5.2 Percent In August, Government Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Higher rents and gasoline prices largely replaced food as the sharpest spurs to higher prices that kept inflation at an annualized rate of 5.2 percent during August, the government said. Separate goverment reports also released Wednesday showed a modest rise in personal income and a drop in housing construction. The news had little impact on the financial markets, where stocks, bonds, oil prices and the dollar were little changed. Trading was more dramatic in precious metals. Gold prices tumbled below the $ 400-a-troy-ounce level in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for the first time since early last year. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold for current delivery fell $ 6.90 a troy ounce to close at $ 398.40, the first time the metal closed below $ 400 since Feb. 18, 1987, when it fetched $ 392.70. Analysts have attributed the recently depressed gold market to growing investor disillusionment with bullion as a hedge against inflation. In its report on inflation, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said food and beverage prices rose 0.5 percent in August as the effects of the drought in the Farm Belt began to ease. Prices jumped 0.9 percent in July when the greatest impact of the dry weather began hitting consumer pocketbooks. But gasoline prices jumped a whopping 3 percent in August, the biggest increase in 12 months, and despite lower utility bills and home energy costs, shelter expenses rose 0.6 percent in August, their largest increase in seven months. But analysts agreed there was nothing alarming in the numbers. `` The scare that we're off to the races or that an inflationary sprial is under way has not materialized and it wo n't materialize,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> WEFA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a <PERSON> Bala </PERSON> <PERSON> Cynwyd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, consulting firm Separately, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said personal income rose a modest 0.2 percent in August, the smallest gain in eight months, although much of it represented declines in both farm subsidies and farm income. Wages and salaries were up just 0.3 percent. After adjustments for inflation, the government said, Americans' average weekly earnings fell 1.3 percent in August The decline in workers' buying power was the third in the past four months and the worst since the government began keeping tabs on real earnings in 1964. The decrease stemmed from a 0.9 percent drop in the average number of hours worked, from 34.9 hours to 34.6 hours, and the 0.4 percent hike in consumer prices. Average hourly earnings were $ 9.24, unchanged from July. Another <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report showed housing construction fell 3.3 percent last month, with a steep drop in new apartments outweighing a small gain in single-family home building. For the first eight months of this year, housing starts are running 9.9 percent below the same period in 1987.

 The oil futures market remains cautious in advance of next week's meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> price monitoring committee, analysts say. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the November contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, settled 19 cents higher at $ 14.56 a barrel Wednesday. Tuesday was the last day of the crude contract for October delivery. Other contract month were mixed at the close. Wholesale unleaded gasoline for October delivery gained 0.92 cent to close at 45.35 cents a gallon, while other contract months also closed higher. The October wholesale heating oil contract lost 0.23 cent to settle at 41.09 cents a gallon. Other heating oil contracts settled mixed on the day. Skepticism about the outcome of the upcoming meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION>' pricing committee has made traders relucant to sell, analysts said. The meeting is scheduled for Sunday and Monday. `` This is a market that sees considerable storm clouds on the horizon,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a research analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` Crude prices are holding up probably because there's some chance that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> can pull a rabbit out of the hat.'' There is speculation that such a meeting could lead to a gathering of all 13 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members and a possible reduction in the cartel's oil output. Recent reports have suggested that several <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> countries are producing far above their assigned quotas, helping to flood world markets with oil and keeping prices weak. Nevertheless, near-month contracts for crude oil and gasoline continued to gain strength from falling inventories in the face of strong demand. Oil brokers said demand is up nearly 2 percent from last year. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil stocks were down by 6.212 million barrels in the week ended Sept. 16, while gasoline stocks fell by 2.58 million barrels.

<TEXT>
 Representatives of 24 Third World governments get together today to discuss ways to win more help from richer countries, as formal sessions begin for the joint annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>. Informal meetings have been going on all week during the arrival of delegates from the 151 member governments, as well as representatives of banks and industrial companies. At the top of most governments' concerns is the burden of interest payments on developing countries' debt, due to reach $ 1.2 billion by the end of this year. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the biggest debtor _ <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, which owes about $ 120 billion _ is to sign a new $ 82 billion agreement with its creditor banks, including $ 5.2 billion in new loans to help the nation cover its obligations for 1987, 1988 and the first half of next year. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> suspended interest payments on its debt in February 1987, but officially ended the moratorium on Wednesday. But new money lent by banks goes largely to pay interest on old debt. Third World governments will ask wealthier governments, and the bank and fund, to increase their lending. Later in the week, the wealthier countries will meet on their own problems as well as those of the Third World. The most important session will be by the `` Group of Seven,'' comprising the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. The Third World debt problem has been getting much vocal sympathy in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. A `` Counter-Congress'' consisting of critics of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> also opens on Thursday. On Wednesday, former West German Chancellor <PERSON> Willy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON> appealed for debt reductions for developing nations. With President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s administration taking the lead, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> have resisted such pleas as counterproductive. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has the largest share of voting strength in both entities. Critics of the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> say the need to make interest payments, and conditions set by the fund and bank for new loans, compel governments to raise prices and to reduce wages. Fund and bank officials argue that such policies are needed to prevent worse suffering, and to put the debtor countries into better position to borrow again. Mobilizing criticism here has been the left-wing <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION>, whichhas representatives in the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> legislature and the West German parliament. The group, which says it disapproves of violence as a political method, plans a mass demonstration in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> on Sunday, when it hopes to bring 40,000 protesters into the streets. The Greens also have taken the lead in organizing a `` Permanent Peoples' Tribunal'' to meet Monday and accuse the bank and fund of damaging the environment and violating the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> charter. Spokesmen for the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> say they will furnish information to the organizers but will not send representatives to appear at the four-day session.

 <ORGANIZATION> Buick </ORGANIZATION> says its 1989 line further splits a perception of a few years ago that it was difficult to tell the automobiles from Oldsmobiles or other <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> cars. `` When you looked at the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Buick </ORGANIZATION> and Oldsmobile -RRB- cars on the road a year or two ago, there was n't much difference,'' Buick General Manager <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Mertz </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` But they're going one way and we're going another.'' <ORGANIZATION> Buick </ORGANIZATION> introduced its new lineup of cars for the coming model year on Wednesday, saying the decline in the <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> division's sales has ended. Oldsmobile, <ORGANIZATION> Cadillac </ORGANIZATION> and Chevrolet introduced their 1989 versions earlier this month. In the early 1980s, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> was criticized for making too many cars that looked too much alike. But recently, including this month's introductions of 1989 models, executives from each of <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s car divisions have stressed the differences between their cars and those of other divisions Chevrolet has been seen as aiming its new cars, especially through the new Geo line, at economy-conscious buyers, and Oldsmobile is shifting its sights to a market that is younger and more interested in high technology than the segment traditionally associated with its cars. <PERSON> Mertz </PERSON> predicted at a news conference that <ORGANIZATION> Buick </ORGANIZATION>'s sales in the'89 model year would show slight gains from the previous model year. `` We have arrested the -LRB- sales -RRB- downturn,'' he said. `` November was the low.'' He speculated final figures for the model year due early next month should show <ORGANIZATION> Buick </ORGANIZATION> held 5.7 percent of the market. That share, <PERSON> Mertz </PERSON> said, should rise to 6 percent to 6.5 percent during the coming year. Much of the sales gain is expected from the <LOCATION> Riviera </LOCATION>, a two-door coupe being lengthened by 11 inches in 1989, mainly in the rear of the car, to about 16 -LCB- feet. `` We see an 18,000 to 22,000 range in'89, about twice that of the current year,'' <PERSON> Mertz </PERSON> said of Riviera sales. <ORGANIZATION> Buick </ORGANIZATION>'s two-seater <PERSON> Reatta </PERSON>, with a base price of $ 26,700, will return for 1989 after its introduction last January. <ORGANIZATION> Buick </ORGANIZATION> has sold 2,500 of the cars and production is quickening toward a 1989 goal of 7,000 to 8,000, <PERSON> Mertz </PERSON> said. Reatta is the sixth-shortest but is one of the heaviest of <ORGANIZATION> Buick </ORGANIZATION>'s 16-car lineup, weighing in at 3,394 pounds. Only the <LOCATION> Riviera </LOCATION> coupe and two full-size station wagons are heavier. Officials said <ORGANIZATION> Buick </ORGANIZATION> would continue its Skylark and Skyhawk models, with base prices starting at $ 9,285, and `` We will have a small but steady market in full-size wagons,'' <PERSON> Mertz </PERSON> said. In the middle of the model year, <ORGANIZATION> Buick </ORGANIZATION> will introduce its Park Avenue Ultra, a luxury sedan with full leather interiors, multiple seat adjustments and other features. No price has been set.

<TEXT>
 Executives of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suzuki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> say the company has recovered strongly since a private report in June alleged that its Samurai utility vehicle was prone to flipping. `` I think the consumers are reassured,'' <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> said at a news conference Wednesday to introduce the'89 <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> line of two utility vehicles and a car. `` Right now, we've sucked the pipeline -LRB- for Samurais -RRB- dry ... `` It just shows the consumer confidence in the vehicle,'' <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> said of the rebound `` I think we're stronger.'' <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> predicted selling somewhere around 2,000 Samurais monthly in the 1989 model year. Last June, <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> was stung by reports by <ORGANIZATION> Consumers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, publisher of Consumer Reports, that the Samurai was dangerously prone to rolling over. The company denied the charges, but watched its June sales plummet 63.8 percent, to 2,199 from 6,074 in May. But by August, aided by a major buyer incentives campaign, sales had rebounded to 12,208 vehicles. This coming model year, the Samurai will be back in <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON>'s 200 dealers in 39 states, joined by two new models: the Swift automobile and the Sidekick four-wheel-drive vehicle. The Swift, to be available in two models, is a companion for <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet </ORGANIZATION>'s newly introduced <ORGANIZATION> Geo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION>, an economy-minded car built by <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The Sidekick will be linked the Geo Tracker, a four-wheel drive vehicle also built in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. In April, production of those Suzukis and Chevrolets will be moved to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> officials insisted Sidekick and Samurai sales should not overlap. Sidekicks, they said, were aimed for an older market than were Samurais, which are built a little more for off-road use _ a bit shorter and narrower, but with more ground clearance than the Sidekick. The Sidekick comes in a number of variations, depending on, among other things, whether it's equipped with a 1.3 - or 1.6-liter engine and whether it has a cloth or hard top Base price for the Samurai will be $ 8,495 and the Sidekick will go for a base of $ 8,995. The Swift GLX has a base price of $ 7,495 and the GTi will retail for $ 8,995. Between now and April, <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> said, it hoped to sell 30,000 Sidekicks and 10,000 of both Swift models. Like the Samurai, the Sidekick will be brought to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as a truck.

<HEAD>Mass. Bans Mandatory Arbitration Between Stockbrokers, Investors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The securities industry is expected to mount a constitutional challenge to new <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> regulations designed to protect small investors by barring agreements that prevent investors from suing their stockbrokers. Responding to a flood of investor complaints after last year's stock market crash, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> today becomes the first state to ban such agreements The new regulations outlaw contracts that require arbitration in disputes over losses. Securities industry officials say <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> is treading on thin constitutional ice in enacting the guidelines because the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last year upheld contracts that make arbitration agreements a precondition for doing business. `` Any lender has preconditions on what terms they lend you money,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON>, general counsel of the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday. `` It's not unreasonable to say if we have a dispute we're not going to go through the very expensive and inefficient method of litigation.'' <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON>, who testified against the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> rule at a July hearing, predicted securities industry groups would sue the state over the mandatory arbitration ban. Officials said 16 other states are planning similar regulations. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' new rules, to be filed today by the secretary of state's office, take effect Jan. 1, 1989. `` We're concerned about investors having a choice,'' said Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Meehan </PERSON>. `` We do n't want them to be in a position where they have no choice but to sign away their day in court.'' Most brokerage firms require customers to settle disputes through an arbitration hearing sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION> or other market organizations. Arbitration is cheaper and faster than suing, but investors have only a limited right to appeal. While big institutional investors can negotiate contracts with brokerages, individual investors usually have little choice but to agree, often unknowingly, to arbitration. A <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> survey this year of 65 firms handling 90 percent of all customer accounts found virtually all require arbitration, particularly for customers who borrow money from the firm through margin accounts or trade in risky stock options. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> officials said they have received hundreds of complaints since the Oct. 19 market crash from disgruntled investors who did n't realize they had waived their right to sue for losses. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> said it received 1,175 arbitration cases through August compared with 616 for the same period of 1987 and a total of 1,000 for all last year. Securities lawyers said mandatory arbitration agreements often are buried in `` boilerplate gobbledygook'' of contracts in sections on margin accounts or options. `` I know of very few industries that try to incorporate such restrictions in their agreements or have been allowed to do that to such an extent,'' said <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Cantwell </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, securities lawyer who opposes mandatory arbitration. <PERSON> Cantwell </PERSON> said the market crash led to more investor complaints only because people started losing money. `` One, two, three years before the crash, a lot of improper practices by brokers simply went unnoticed or would n't be focused on by investigators because things were going well,'' he said. In addition to the state action, a bill introduced in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in July would make it illegal for a broker to turn away a customer's business for refusing to sign an arbitration clause and would reform the arbitration process. `` It would probably be more beneficial if the arbitration system itself was fairer and took into consideration the customer's point of view more frequently than it does now,'' said <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, editor of the journal of the Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Individual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION>. Analysts say the system favors brokers because investors are allowed a limited number of challenges and arbitration boards generally consist of former securities officials and can be insensitive to small investors' concerns. `` Arbitration remains and probably will remain the primary dispute resolution for customers with complaints against their brokers,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administrators </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, an organization of state regulators. `` But that does n't mean it should be exclusive or individuals should be denied their fundamental rights.'' The association said the number of its arbitration cases quintupled from 800 in 1980 to 4,100 last year and could climb above 6,000 this year. But <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON> said only a very small percentage of complaints to the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> are about arbitration. He said most brokerage firms do n't require customers with cash accounts to sign arbitration clauses and customers who want to borrow money on margin can go to banks or elsewhere. According to the secretary of state's office, the 16 other states planning to impose similar regulations are: <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the No. 2 computer maker, is opening its doors to outside technology. Analysts say <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION>'s acquisition of a 5 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> Mips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> marks a move to accept and implement technological advances occurring outside the company. Digital announced plans Wednesday to develop computer work stations based on the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> company's technology. Work stations are expensive desktop computers that typically are used for work that requires extensive manipulation of numbers or sophisticated graphics, such as science, engineering, design and financial modeling. `` This is an acceptance on <ORGANIZATION> DEC </ORGANIZATION>'s part that the computer user's dollar is being spent on work stations and small systems,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Watts </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Needham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` I think they feel that internally they've got enough on their hands in terms of keeping their own product line up to date and competitive, and if they want to tap other segments of the market they have to look outside,'' he said <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> said it is lining up with <ORGANIZATION> Mips </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Sunnyvale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, to speed new work station products to the marketplace. The Maynard-based computer giant is second to <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Microsystems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in the fast-growing work station field. Under the agreement, <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> will used Mips-designed microprocessors that use reduced instruction set computing, or Risc, a way to speed up computing by simplifying the steps a processor has to carry out. The faster Risc microprocessors are used increasingly in work stations. `` With the addition of Risc technology, <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> will offer customers even more versatility in computer performance to match specific application demands,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Strecker </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> vice president. Digital stock closed at $ 92.62 -LCB- in composite <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exhange </ORGANIZATION> trading Wednesday, up 12 -LCB- cents. Analysts said they expect <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> to unveil a work station using <ORGANIZATION> Mips </ORGANIZATION> chip technology by the end of the year. They said the decision by <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> marks the first time it has strayed from its reliance on its own Vax computer design. Analysts also said the <ORGANIZATION> Mips </ORGANIZATION> deal marks a concession to industry standards because Risc-based systems work well with Unix, the standard operating software made by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION>. Digital also acquired the right to use future <ORGANIZATION> Mips </ORGANIZATION> technology. In the past, <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> has designed all its computer components itself.

<HEAD>Polaroid Sues To Block Shamrock Buyout</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 After advising its stockholders to ignore two hostile takeover attempts, <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has sued to block <ORGANIZATION> Shamrock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s unwanted bid. The suit filed Tuesday in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> seeks to prohibit the <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, - based <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> from acquiring any shares of <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> stock or attempting another tender offer and asks that the company divest itself of <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> stock it now owns The suit was filed after <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> urged its stockholders to reject as inadequate a sweetened $ 2.6 billion takeover bid by <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>. Last month, <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors turned down <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>'s first unsolicited offer. The complaint alleges <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> engaged in a variety of securities law violations, including fraudulent, deceptive and manipulative acts. The suit also claims that <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> failed to disclose material information to stockholders. `` Polaroid is taking a more aggressive stance,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Relyea </PERSON>, a photography analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Eberstadt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Polaroid officials allege in the suit that <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>'s offer to buy <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> shares at $ 42 is `` illusory.'' They said the move either was designed to allow <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> to reap a quick premium by selling its own <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> stock, or to allow <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> to pressure <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> into a merger at a price that would be detrimental to other stockholders. <PERSON> Relyea </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> may slow <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> down with the lawsuit, echoing what he said was a widely-held view that <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> actually may be paving the way for another company to take over <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> while it makes a tidy profit. The suit also claims <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> violated the federal reporting requirements by failing to disclose the identity of all members of its ownership group. And the suit alleges <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> is trying to exclude the <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> employee stock ownership plan from its offer, which is contrary to federal requirements that all stockholders receive equal treatment in a tender offer. Shamrock spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Grimaldi </PERSON> said Wednesday that the company had not seen the suit and could not comment. <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> has asked the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to conduct a hearing on its request for a preliminary injunction against <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>'s offer before Oct. 6 Last month, <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> rejected an unsolicited offer from <LOCATION> Shamrock </LOCATION> that would have paid stockholders $ 40 a share plus 40 percent of the eventual award in <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 5.7 billion patent infringement lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Analysts valued the offer at about $ 44 a share given a $ 1 billion settlement in the <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> case After advising stockholders Tuesday to reject the sweetened bid, <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> also filed notice with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that it has begun preliminary negotiations with third parties about issuing preferred stock to them, a step that would make the company harder to take over. <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>, which is owned by the family of <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Disney </PERSON>, nephew of the late animator <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>, says that if its bid succeeds it would drop <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s fledgling venture into 35mm film, sell most of the company's undeveloped real estate, narrow the company's manufacturing facilities and simplify <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s research and development activities to focus on the company's core businesses The offer hinged on the invalidation of <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION>'s recent issuance of 9.7 million shares to a new employee stock ownership plan, a move <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> made early in its attempt to block <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> has renewed calls for federal mediators to declare an impasse in contract talks with its <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union, after 98 percent of the union's voting members rejected the carrier's latest cost-cutting contract offer. `` The predictable defeat of the contract proposal ... should send another strong message to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> that the two parties are at an impasse,'' <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON>, senior <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> vice president of human resources, said Wednesday. `` The board must act quickly to release the parties from dead-end mediation to resolve these issues,'' he said. Contract talks began nine months ago. The union vote tallied Wednesday showed 81 percent of the union's 9,500 mechanics and ground-support workers cast ballots, with 98 percent voting `` no,'' and 90 ballots in favor of the proposal that local President <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> says would slash pay in half. Eastern has lost about $ 1 billion in the past decade and posted a second-quarter loss of $ 89.8 million. The company says the $ 161 million in wage concessions it seeks represent pay cuts of 10 to 20 percent. An impasse could be declared if federal mediator <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bickford </PERSON> told the board he could do no more. If the board agreed, both parties would have a chance for arbitration. If either party declined, that would begin a 30-day cooling off period, after which the union would become free to strike and Eastern could impose its conditions unilaterally. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, who expects negotiations to resume soon, said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s offer was unacceptable because it would cut pay, sick days, vacation time and medical benefits The vote `` makes it crystal-clear that the membership were very concerned, by the number who turned out. The people were very angry,'' said <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>. But Eastern says cuts are essential to restore the carrier to profitability. On Sept. 10, the Miami-based carrier eliminated 4,000 jobs, and two weeks earlier it cut 12 percent of its routes, ending service to 14 cities. `` We believe it was our best offer,'' <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON> said of the proposal offered in July. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> claimed that <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s parent firm <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, hoped for a strike. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> reiterated his contentions that <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> aims to give <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> assets to sister carrier <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, which is largely non-union. `` Absolutely not true,'' Ms. <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON> said. `` What we do want is a 30-day cooling-off period. We believe the only way we can reach a settlement is if we have a deadline. Without a deadline, there's no incentive for the <ORGANIZATION> IAM </ORGANIZATION> to settle.'' Eastern also is negotiating a contract with its pilots union, which with the flight attendants union took 20 percent wage cuts in 1986. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> blames the company's money troubles on poor management, and said the union offered to take a one-year pay freeze.

 Financial uncertainty caused by the drought are forcing farmers to hold off buying new machinery for their fields, dashing hopes for a banner year in the farm equipment industry, according to some salesmen. `` This year will certainly slow down next year, maybe not as much, but there wil be a cloud hanging over us. It takes a lot of years for a farmer to recover a loss,'' said <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Hennessey </PERSON>, a territory manager for <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Idea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Coldwater </LOCATION>. `` Normally, they'll trade it in on a 3-5 year basis, and this would've been the greatest fall in eight years. But then the drought hit and delayed their opportunity to buy,'' said B.E. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, southern <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> marketing manager for Case IH. <PERSON> Hennessey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> were among approximately 500 commercial exhibitors at the three-day Farm Science Review, which ends Thursday. The agricultural exposition included about $ 40 million worth of farm equipment. The number of hours a farmer uses a tractor varies, but Case's C.L <PERSON> Lephart </PERSON> said an average for a cash grain farmer would be about 250 hours a year. Normally, a farmer may trade that in after five years, but now they are allowing their equipment to depreciate and trading it in with as many as 7,000 hours on it. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said this year's drought was a particular letdown because analysts finally were anticipating a good year after years of a depressed farm economy. `` They'd finally got their debt load paid off, which would've permitted them to come back and buy, but now ...'' said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, his voice trailing off <PERSON> Lephart </PERSON>, Case marketing manager for northwest <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, said the drought led to a new marketing plan. `` Discounts, financing, leases. We're seeing a lot more of all of these,'' <PERSON> Lephart </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> parts marketing manager <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hothem </PERSON> said the company hopes to cash in on a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> projection that there will be as many as 25 million new acres to till next year. While equipment sales have been slow, a different type of machinery has moved out of the storerooms and onto the farms. Tillage equipment, such as field cultivators, have sold better than usual `` because no-tillage did n't work out,'' <PERSON> Hennessey </PERSON> said, referring to a farming method aimed at soil conservation `` Conventional and mechanical tillage is coming back into play,'' <PERSON> Lepart </PERSON> said. Lepart and <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> think 1989 will be a better year for sales, but say they wo n't be able to put profits into perspective until all crops are harvested. `` There's certainly a lot of room for optimism,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. The Farm Science Review, on the 992-acre <ORGANIZATION> Molly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caren </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, about 25 miles west of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, included field demonstrations and exhibits by farm equipment manufacturers and dealers.

 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to revise an advertising plan that state authorities say would boost car prices while illegally forcing dealers to participate, according to Attorney General <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. Separately, a group of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> auto dealers has sued to block a similar advertising plan in their state. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> division planned to increase the amount its dealer franchises pay for their cars by 1 percent _ an average of $ 40 to $ 50 a car _ to finance a dealers association that would run the automaker's national advertising campaigns. The company offered dealers who joined the association a 25 percent discount on the surcharge, but told those who did not join that they would not receive the discount, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said Wednesday in announcing the settlement. Under the plan, the dealers would pass on the surcharge to car buyers. Chevrolet planned to begin the program with its September shipments and tacked the 1 percent charge on to its dealers' bills for this month. `` A lot of dealers complained about it,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said he learned about the Chevrolet plan in August. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Herndon </PERSON>, solicitor general for the attorney general's office, investigated the plan, then informed <LOCATION> Chevrolet </LOCATION> that it violated <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> law. Under the law, autmobile dealers can not be required to participate in a dealers association. `` This type of deceptive business practice is a violation of fair trade competition, and the consumer is the ultimate victim,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` Obviously, if <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> dealers have to compete with other <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> dealers -LRB- in advertising -RRB-, it means better prices for consumers,'' <PERSON> Herndon </PERSON> said. The attorney general's office and Chevrolet last week negotiated a settlement under which dealers will participate in the ad plan only if they want, and then pay the discounted fee. Those who do n't participate will be paid an amount equivalent to the 25 percent discount Dealers did not pay the September charge, <PERSON> Herndon </PERSON> said. At least 27 other states have auto dealer laws similar to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s, the attorney general said. Other automakers _ including <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> _ have tried similar tactics, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and three <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> dealerships sued <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and its <ORGANIZATION> GMC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Truck </ORGANIZATION> and Chevrolet divisions in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, alleging a similar advertising program in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> violates state law prohibiting mandatory participation in a dealers association. They plaintiffs want the court to stop the program and award them any damages allowed under state law, plus double the amount <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> has collected under the program. The Sept. 8 suit has not been scheduled for trial. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> has not filed a response.

<HEAD>U.S. Official Says United States, EEC Far Apart on Meat Hormones,

<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its European trading partners remain far apart on solving disputes over a ban on hormone-treated meat and support for civil aircraft development, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said Thursday. But <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kingon </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, told a news conference that trade relations between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the 12-nation European trading bloc are `` actually pretty good.'' `` We have succeeded in the last year and a half of cleaning the table of most of the troublesome trade issues that existed some two years ago between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the community,'' he said. Trade between the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will likely exceed more than $ 160 billion this year, up from $ 145 billion in 1987 and $ 131 billion in 1986, <PERSON> Kingon </PERSON> said. Two key disputes remaining, he said, are European enforcement of a ban on meat from animals treated with growth hormones and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> objections to government support for <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrie </ORGANIZATION>, a four-nation European consortium that competes with <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kingon </PERSON> said little progress has been made on either issue and no resolution was in sight The meat hormone dispute, he said, `` is perhaps the most difficult problem on the table.'' An <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, who demanded anonymity, said, `` No new initiative can be expected from the -LRB- community -RRB- on hormones. There is a deadlock.'' The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> says it wants to ban imports of all hormone-treated meat for health reasons. Late last year, it decided to delay implementation of the ban until Jan. 1, 1989. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had threatened to take retaliatory action if the ban was imposed. It contends the use of hormones to fatten animals, which is a common practice among American farmers, is not a health risk. <PERSON> Kingon </PERSON> predicted the issue would wind up in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, an international body that solves disputes between trading partners. On the Airbus issue, <PERSON> Kingon </PERSON> said negotiations were continuing. But, he said, `` I would not want to mislead you to say we are close to a solution because we're not.'' A key objective of U.S.-European negotiations has been to set `` effective discipline'' on new infusions of capital and on the conditions under which government support may be provided to future civil aircraft programs. The four governments involved in the Airbus program are <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> is made up of <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>SEC Said to Authorizes Civil Charges Against New York Bond House</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has authorized its staff to charge <ORGANIZATION> Matthews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Wright </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and several officers of the bond house with fraud and other abuses in connection with the underwriting of more than $ 1 billion in municipal bonds, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday. Quoting what it called people familiar with the situation, the newspaper said the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> took the unannounced step at a closed-door meeting Tuesday. The reported action followed a major inquiry into the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> firm's activities. <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> McCue </PERSON> declined comment on the Journal report, in accordance with the agency's policy on enforcement matters. But the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> had stated in a previously published notice that its agenda for the Tuesday session included `` institution of administrative proceedings of an enforcement nature.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Aufhauser </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Matthews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> attorney, was not immediately available to comment, a receptionist said. The Journal quoted him as saying he'd had discussions with the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> staff but could not elaborate. <ORGANIZATION> Matthews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has consistently denied wrongdoing and has asserted its underwriting practices conform with industry practices. The Journal quoted sources as saying the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> action means the agency's enforcement staff will enter into settlement negotiations with <ORGANIZATION> Matthews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. If those fail, the sources were quoted as saying, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> may charge the firm with a range of alleged abuses. Most of the charges stem from <ORGANIZATION> Matthews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s role as an underwriter of 25 municipal bond deals in 1985 and 1986, the sources were quoted as saying. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> case does n't include the firm's best-known deals, $ 380 million in questionable issues underwritten for <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION> and the Northern Mariana islands in 1984 and 1985, the newspaper quoted sources as saying. It was unclear why these were omitted, but the newspaper said it may have been because other government enforcement agencies are scrutinizing them. Last year a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION> charged <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Abba </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, the firm's executive vice president, with fraud, bribery and obstruction of justice. He's pleaded innocent and will go on trial in January. In August, the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> decreed that interest income on the <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION> and Mariana bonds are n't tax-exempt. This is significant because the tax-exempt status of such issues is a major selling point of municipal bonds.

 The co-chairman of the congressionally appointed <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> says he did not call for tax hikes or cuts in Social Security to help erase the federal deficit, despite several reports to the contrary. `` I am somewhat surprised that there has been so much interest in my remarks'' in a speech Tuesday to an economic consulting firm, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> said in a statement Wednesday. `` Let me make it clear that I did not call for or endorse cuts in the Social Security programs. Nor did I endorse a tax increase. `` I did tell the cold, statistical truth about the size of the deficit. I further stated that the views expressed were my own.'' <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> said Tuesday in a speech that Social Security, <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> and other government entitlement programs would have to be cut and spending would also have to be reduced in defense programs in order to get the deficit under control. `` We have to go to Social Security, <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> and entitlements generally and we have to go to defense,'' <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> said, adding that he realized how politically charged such comments were. `` That means you are withholding money from the sick, the elderly and the defense of the nation,'' he said in the Tuesday speech. Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said Wednesday if the commission recommended cuts in Social Security `` they wo n't get to first base in a Dukakis-Bentsen administration. `` I oppose reductions in scheduled payments to Social Security recipients, and I am committed to maintaining full benefits and full cost of living increases,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> added. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> presidential campaign also denounced <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>' suggestions `` Any request -LRB- by the economic commission -RRB- for new taxes or tax increases or a raid on the Social Security system would be bounced back immediately with the stamp ` Return to Sender.' We would not take delivery on either of those proposals,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, a lawyer and former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said in his clarifying statement that defense expenditures account for 28 percent of the federal budget and entitlement programs account for 47 percent. `` That leads to an inescapable conclusion: to the extent that we reduce the debt by reducing outlays, it has to be done largely in defense and entitlements,'' he said in the statement. Nevertheless, reports of <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>' remarks spurred a vehement Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, to promise Social Security will `` never'' be cut to help wipe out the federal deficit. `` As chairman of the -LRB- Finance -RRB- subcomittee on Social Security, I'm here to say never,'' <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> said at a news conference Wednesday. `` It must n't be done and it wo n't be.'' <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> is one of the commission's 12 members, and, in fact, the body was created by legislation he sponsored, at the urging of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>. `` We have finally got the Social Security system in stable, solid, surplus condition,'' <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> said. `` To start raiding the trust fund would be unforgivable, given what we did in 1983.'' That year, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed Social Security reforms that resulted in $ 160 billion worth of additional revenues and benefit reductions over the years 1983 to 1990, according to <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>. `` That was the contribution of the Social Security system to reducing the deficit, a contribution already made,'' he said. The commission is composed of six Republicans and six Democrats appointed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. After the November election, the new president will appoint two new members, one from each party.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> will ask for an international trade inquiry into <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> restrictions on imports of sugar, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said. The Commission will make the request at a meeting Thursday of the Council of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the international trade organization meeting in <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> and studying ways to improve world trade relations. The panel will be asked to examine the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s contention that the long-standing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> import curbs are inconsistent with international trading rules, said the spokeswoman, who declined to be named. The EEC and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials had two inconclusive rounds of talks on the issue in July and early in September, she said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has imposed import restrictions on sugar, dairy products, peanuts and cotton for many years ince it was granted a waiver from international trade rules in 1955. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> contends that the protection enabled <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farmers to build up their production of the commodities. Sugar production in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> rose to 5.4 million tons in 1986 from 4.2 million tons in 1955, according to the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>. The spokeswoman said that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> import quota for sugar in 1988 amounted to 700,000 metric tons while the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> imported 4 million tons of sugar last year. The spokeswoman said that the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> had similar complaints about the other products covered by the waiver but is still reviewing those cases. She also said that the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> would express to the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> its concern about the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade bill which it believes to be protectionist and potentially damaging for the <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> round of international trade talks.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Share prices were lower at midday Thursday, as players took profits in the wake of two consecutive days of strong gains. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was down 7 points, or 0.4 percent, at 1,789.8 at about 12:30 p.m. The index traded narrowly throughout the morning. At its best, the index was down 3.1 points, and at its worst it lost 8.7 points. Volume was light to moderate, with 231.3 million shares changing hands by midday, compared with 260.9 million shares at the same time Wednesday. Sentiment was cautious ahead of Tuesday's British trade report for August, dealers said. `` Until we get these trade figures out of the way, I do n't think we're going to roar away,'' said one equity salesman. Most of Thursday morning's trading was limited to a few speculative stocks, dealers said. `` The market is at the moment really all about rumors and takeovers,'' the salesman said. `` It's frankly pretty low quality business.''

<TEXT>
 Two companies are trying to add some glitter to the drab copper and iron-ore mining scene of far northern <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. It started as a glint in a <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> metallurgist's eye. First Dow, and now a <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> company, <ORGANIZATION> Crystal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exploration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, entered the search for diamonds in the state's <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>. Seven Kimberlite pipes _ volcanic rock shafts that can yield the earth's hardest mineral _ have been discovered. Core drilling has unearthed a scattering of sand-grain sized diamonds, too few and too small for commercial production. But the explorers say the search is young. The pipe formations are in a 40-mile area around <LOCATION> Iron </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> and Crystal Falls, at the western end of the <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> along the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> border. In the few places on earth they are found, Kimberlite pipes occur in clusters of up to several dozen, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Huml </PERSON>, a Dow research associate. <PERSON> Huml </PERSON>, a metallurgist by trade and geologist by avocation, said he thinks there are more than a dozen Kimberlite pipes in the <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>. Dow has searched for six years. Now more exploration and mining expertise is needed, <PERSON> Huml </PERSON> said. `` Dow is not a hard-rock mining company.'' Dow recently sold its mineral leases and geological data, for an undisclosed amount, to <ORGANIZATION> Crystal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exploration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> subsidiary of <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Restech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>. Restech has mineral exploration and gold mining operations in western <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> It will carry on the search, while <PERSON> Dow </PERSON> holds onto an option to take part in the exploration and development, and to share in any profits. Occasional diamond finds in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> farm fields in the late 1800s and early 1900s long had geologists looking to the north, said <ORGANIZATION> Crystal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exploration </ORGANIZATION>'s president, <PERSON> Sigfried </PERSON> <PERSON> Muessig </PERSON>. <PERSON> Muessig </PERSON> said a Kimberlite pipe, named for <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> in the diamond-mining region of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, is the only formation known to produce the gems. `` It is a cylindrical formation where volcanic rock has come up 120 miles from the bowels of the earth, and the heat and pressure have formed the diamonds,'' he said. `` It's a very rare occurrence,'' <PERSON> Huml </PERSON> said. Other Kimberlite pipes have been found in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. None commercially produce diamonds. There were no volcanic remnants in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, so geologists thought glaciers carried the diamonds there from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Muessig </PERSON> said. But he said the focus shifted in 1981 when the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey found a Kimberlite formation _ the <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ellen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pipe </LOCATION> _ about 10 miles northeast of Crystal Falls. It was evidence that volcanoes smoked and spewed nearly 200 million years ago in the <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, and possibly generated the heat and compression forces to leave a diamond treasure behind. The glaciers flattened the volcanoes, but since 1981 Dow has found six more Kimberlite pipes _ several hundred feet across at the surface and covered by volcanic debris, <PERSON> Huml </PERSON> said. In Dow's explorations, he said, `` We have found microdiamonds, generally small, less than a millimeter in diameter. They are grain-sized.'' But the explorers still think the western <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> was the source of the gems found in farm fields to the south. `` We think there is good potential, because of the historical finds,'' <PERSON> Muessig </PERSON> said. Crystal Exploration will do more sampling in the already discovered pipes in the next year, <PERSON> Muessig </PERSON> said, and will continue exploring for more Kimberlite formations, `` in hopes the next pipe we discover will have gem-quality stones.''

 The stock market held steady today, continuing its recent indecisive pattern. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 1.07 to 2,091.57 in the first half hour of trading. Gainers and losers were evenly balanced in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 415 up, 424 down and 515 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 19.59 million shares as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street. Analysts said nothing had happened to break the standoff that set in several weeks ago on Wall Street. Some prominent analysts and policymakers, including Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, have been warning of the dangers of revived inflation. Yet the price of gold, a primary gauge of inflationary expectations, has fallen below $ 400 an ounce this week for the first time in more than a year and a half. Similarly, brokers say, there is widespread confusion and uncertainty among investors about prospects for continued economic growth in 1989 under a new administration whose makeup and policies are not yet known.

<HEAD>Northwest Airlines Rejects $200 Million Offer to Sell Land in

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> has rejected a $ 200 million offer from Japanese real estate developers to sell land it owns in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, officials of the airline said. Northwest officials declined Wednesday to discuss details of the purchase offer from <ORGANIZATION> Koshin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> or say why it was rejected. `` We do n't have any property that's for sale,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Redmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>. But in a letter to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> real estate agent for <ORGANIZATION> Koshin </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vice </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON> said the airline believes the land is worth more than has been offered and said it `` has been retained for possible further development by us in connection with our business in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.'' The developers wanted to build high-rise condominiums on the 50,000-square-foot plot, which would have been sold to property-starved <PERSON> Japa </PERSON> - nese consumers for $ 10 million to $ 15 million apiece <ORGANIZATION> Koshin </ORGANIZATION> hoped to place 60 to 65 units on the property. <ORGANIZATION> KOAR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a Los Angeles-based real estate firm representing <ORGANIZATION> Koshin </ORGANIZATION>, said the property sought by <ORGANIZATION> Koshin </ORGANIZATION> contains five or six small two-story buildings that the airline uses to house employees, including flight crews and corporate staff members, on both a permanent and temporary basis. <ORGANIZATION> KOAR </ORGANIZATION> officials said the property is surrounded by exclusive residences, department stores and high-rise office buildings. Because of the scarcity of land and the density of the population in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, developers there are willing to buy property for $ 4,000 per square foot, which is the amount turned down by Northwest. <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> would not describe the property and said <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> did not want to discuss its real estate holdings. <ORGANIZATION> KOAR </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> has owned the property for more than 30 years, which would mean that it obtained it at a fraction of the price it could fetch today. <ORGANIZATION> KOAR </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Koshin </ORGANIZATION> together own 366,600 shares of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> stock, which represents about 1.3 percent of outstanding shares. The price of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> stock rose 87.5 cents to $ 50.125 Wednesday, as news of the offer by <ORGANIZATION> Koshin </ORGANIZATION> circulated broadly among brokers. <ORGANIZATION> KOAR </ORGANIZATION> officials said <ORGANIZATION> Koshin </ORGANIZATION> has been trying to initiate discussions with <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> officials about a land deal since May to no avail. <ORGANIZATION> Koshin </ORGANIZATION> made its most recent all-cash offer two weeks ago, in which it `` implored <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> to act in its shareholders' best interests,'' said <ORGANIZATION> KOAR </ORGANIZATION> officials. Northwest responded Sept. 12 with a letter from <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON>, which was provided to the <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION> KOAR </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothman </PERSON>, the newspaper said.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> today announced that no enforcement action would be taken against those involved in the sale and default of $ 2.25 billion of <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supply </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> bonds. In a 376-page report on its five-year investigation, the commission staff criticized several parties involved in the sale of the WPPSS bonds, which were issued to finance two nuclear power projects that eventually were terminated. The report concluded that enforcement action was unnecessary because of a civil trial, difficulty in determining responsibility for disclosure statements attached to the bonds and concern that the commission lacked the resources to pursue the case. However, because of settlements in the civil trial, parties considered most responsible in the sale of the bonds will not be required to argue their cases in a public forum. Bondholders are suing 15 utilities that are members of <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION>, the construction arm of the state's public utilities, plus a financial advisor and two engineering firms in a trial that began Sept. 7 in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz </LOCATION>. Most parties originally named as defendants in the suit, including <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> itself, have settled out of court for a total of $ 461 million, including $ 96 million in contested insurance claims. The report concluded that the default, the largest in municipal bond history, resulted from extensive cost overruns and construction delays at <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> Project No. 4 at the <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> nuclear reservation in southeastern <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state and No. 5 at Satsop, west of <LOCATION> Olympia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION>, which issued the bonds, was responsible for the official statements used to sell them but `` avoided disclosure of negative developments,'' the report said `` Most significantly, the supply system failed to disclose that, in October 1980, participants, who were concerned about rising project costs and falling power demands, asked the supply system to study a possible slowdown or termination of the projects.'' Work was halted on the projects in 1981, both were abandoned in January 1982 and in 1983 <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> quit making payments on the bonds after the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> held that the utilities' contracts with the consortium were illegal and thus unenforceable Without payments from the 88 participating utilities, many in other states, <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> defaulted. The commission report also faulted the <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> bond counsel, the firm of <ORGANIZATION> Wood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dawson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Hellman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, which was responsible for assuring that the disclosures accompanying the bond sales were clear on the requirements that participating utilities pay for the projects. `` Although opinions on legal issues frequently contain some uncertainty, the state of the law was not as clear as those relying on the counsel's opinions might reasonably have assumed,'' the report said. `` Further steps were not taken to clarify legal matters.'' <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawson </PERSON> settled outside court in the federal trial in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> for $ 500,000. Bond underwriters, including some of the largest brokerage houses on Wall Street, also were `` in a position to discover inadequacies'' in the disclosures, the report said. `` They did not, however, conduct the kind of investigation in the offerings of these competitively bid bonds that they perform in negotiated bond sales and in corporate securities offerings,'' the report said. Bond underwriters settled in the massive lawsuit for $ 92 million. Despite the size of that settlement, representatives of the 24,000 bond buyers with claims in the federal lawsuit said it was less than the profit of the underwriting firms in selling the WPPSS bonds. Besides the 15 utilities, defendants in the trial include the firm of <ORGANIZATION> Blyth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION>, financial advisor to <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION>, and the construction engineering firms of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Constructors and <ORGANIZATION> Ebasco </ORGANIZATION>.

 Stock prices gave ground today in selling apparently prompted by impatience over the market's recent sluggish performance. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 11.02 to 2,079.48 by 11 a.m. on Wall Street. Losers outnumbered gainers by about 9 to 5 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 397 up, 721 down and 564 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 48.84 million shares at midmorning. Analysts said the market's sluggish recent behavior apparently convinced some investors that stocks were unable to break out of the trading range in which they have fluctuated for several months now. They also noted an absence of conviction about the business outlook to encourage any buying. Some prominent analysts and policymakers, including Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, have been warning of the dangers of revived inflation. Yet the price of gold, a primary gauge of inflationary expectations, has fallen below $ 400 an ounce this week for the first time in more than a year and a half. Similarly, brokers say, there is widespread confusion and uncertainty among investors about prospects for continued economic growth in 1989 under a new administration whose makeup and policies are not yet known. Among actively traded blue chips, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> fell -LCB- to 44 -LCB-; <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> dropped -LRB- to 49 ~; <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> lost -RRB- to 27 -LCB-, and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> was unchanged at 26 -LCB- <ORGANIZATION> Reebok </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, which reported a higher order backlog than a year ago, rose -RRB- to 11 in active trading.

 Grain and soybean futures prices opened narrowly mixed today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> with little news in the market to influence prices. Soybean futures posted slight gains at the opening in reaction to a Soviet newspaper report that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s grain harvest this year would be smaller than the relatively good harvests of the two previous years. But soybeans quickly turned lower on reports of beneficial rain in the soybean-growing region of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and selling linked to the advancing corn and soybean harvest in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. Harvest pressure is overhanging the grain markets as well, limiting the potential for strong rallies, analysts said. `` There really is not much of a story developing,'' said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>, grain specialist with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` The harvest is progressing and in general the market is a little bit tired.'' In early trading, wheat was 1 \ cents to 2 cents lower with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.21 \ a bushel; corn was unchanged to 1 -LCB- cents lower with December at $ 2.86 -RCB- a bushel; oats were 1 cent lower to 1 cent higher with December at $ 2.55 a bushel; soybeans were 3 -LCB- cents lower to \ cent higher with November at $ 8.36 -LCB- a Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .12 cent lower to .18 cent higher with October at 69.27 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .35 cent lower to .15 cent higher with September at 79.40 cents a pound; hogs were .35 cent lower to .13 cent higher with October at 38.90 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .20 cent to .55 cent higher with February at 50.87 cents a pound.

 The nation's savings institutions continued to lose billions of dollars, but at a slightly slower rate in the second quarter of this year when compared to the previous six months, the government said today. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said the nation's 3,000 <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls lost $ 3.6 billion in the April-June period, an improvement over a $ 3.9 billion loss in the first quarter and a record $ 4.0 billion loss in the last three months of 1987. The report came as the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> predicted that taxpayers will have to provide $ 20 billion in a `` bailout-to-come'' to solve the financial crisis confronting the industry. In a speech prepared for delivery on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor today, Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, D-Wis., said it was his `` reluctant but profound conviction'' that the problem `` has grown beyond industry resources. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Barth </PERSON>, chief economist for the bank board, said, however, `` I like to think we have bottomed out and things wo n't get much worse.'' `` But there's still a serious problem,'' he aded. S & amp; Ls lost a record $ 7.8 billion last year and seem certain to surpass that this year, having lost $ 7.5 billion in the first six months. As in the past, the industry's losses in the second quarter were concentrated in a relatively few number of institutions and in one state _ <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, which has been hard hit by the collapse of oil prices. The 271 thrift institutions in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> accounted for $ 3.2 billion of the loss. The 20 worst institutions in the nation _ 17 of them in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> _ lost $ 2.6 billion. There were 497 insolvent institutions, down from 509 in the first quarter. The bank board resolved the cases of 26 institutions in the April-June period, and 14 more institutions slipped into the red. Twenty-nine percent of the industry lost money _ $ 5.1 billion in the second quarter _ more than offsetting the $ 1.5 billion profit earned by the remmaining 71 percent. <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, in his speech, <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> said the taxpayers will have to contribute $ 20 billion toward fixing the problem and he accused the new treasury secretary of being `` nonchalant'' about the crisis. Even if the next <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> appropriates the $ 20 billion, healthy <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls will need to contribute another $ 30 billion over the next several years, he said. `` The bailout-to-come will be the largest ever in the history of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. It will be far bigger than the combined cost of the assistance ... to <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> -LRB- </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> -LRB- </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>,'' he said. Despite that, he said, `` the administration has its head buried in the sand'' and <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> in his confirmation hearing last week `` was nonchalant about the S & amp; L mess.'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, who replaced <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, contended that the industry-financed <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which guarantees S & amp; L deposits up to $ 100,000, has as much as it can spend for now. Estimates of the cost of cleaning up the industry vary from the bank board's $ 31 billion to private projections as high as $ 100 billion. The current bank board estimate is well within its $ 42 billion 10-year revenue projection, but the agency has said it will issue an revised cost estimate this fall. An official of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the auditing arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> last week that the problem was in the $ 45 billion to $ 50 billion range and would require money from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a trade group representing commercial banks, this week pegged the cost at $ 74 billion. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> on Wednesday ordered a top deputy, Undersecretary <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>, to look into the rapidly growing cost estimates. He called on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to consider several steps, including authorizing an additional $ 5 billion in borrowing by <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION>, before appropriating tax money. A senior <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> has enough funds to operate `` well into next year.'' However, if the higher cost estimates appear to be valid, `` then we'll say what this means to funding <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION>, how much it needs and how it should get it,'' he said. Federal regulators have greatly accelerated the pace of <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L closings and mergers since mid-August, committing more than $ 13 billion in aid to resolve the cases of more than 50 institutions. However, <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> charged that, `` The regulators are engaging in sham resolutions. ... These are garbage deals with garbage thrifts.'' The rescues have brought little money from private investors and the acquiring institutions themselves often are thinly capitalized, he said. In other cases, regulators are striking `` Faustian bargains'' with investors who plan to use S & amp; L deposits to further their own business ventures, he said. <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyle </PERSON>, a spokesman for the bank board, said the bank board has brought in substantial private capital with its rescues _ $ 1 billion since July 1987 _ and expects to bring another $ 750 million in by the end of this year. Sen. <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Garn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, the senior Republican on the banking committee, issued a statement assailing `` sanctimonious attempts'' and `` partisan charges'' to shift the blame for the S & amp; L crisis onto the administration. While he did not mention <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> by name, he said he was `` outraged by repeated efforts to get the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> taxpayers to pick up the tab.''

<HEAD>Three Years After Plaza Accord, Currency Markets Still Unsettled</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Today marks the third anniversary of the Plaza Accord, a five-nation agreement that might be described as the Kellogg-Briand Pact of the financial world. The Kellogg-Briand Pact of 1928 was an international agreement to renounce war as an instrument of national policy. In light of subsequent conflicts _ World War II comes immediately to mind _ Kellogg-Briand was a miserable failure. The Plaza Accord of Sept. 22, 1985, was an agreement by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to push down the exchange value of the dollar. The idea was that a cheaper dollar would help shrink the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit and reduce protectionist sentiments in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. At first, the Plaza Accord looked like a smash success. The dollar tumbled all through 1985 and 1986 and into 1987. Only a few impolite skeptics said the dollar would have fallen even without the accord. Then, some funny things happened. First, the finance ministers got together again at the <LOCATION> Louvre </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in February 1987 and decided that further declines in the dollar would be counterproductive. Naturally, the dollar kept falling. Then it rose. Then it fell steeply at the end of 1987. This year it has risen _ up a fat 14 percent against a marketbasket of foreign currencies since Jan. 1. In light of these gyrations, it has begun to seem as though the finance leaders are standing at the bow of an ocean liner with a toy wheel, trying to convince the other passengers they are steering. All this time, people began to notice the cheaper dollar was not working wonders on the trade deficit. Instead of shrinking, the gap set records in 1986 and again in 1987. It has taken until this year to see big improvements. As time went on, it has become increasingly clear that: 1. Central bankers and finance ministers do n't have much control over currency rates. 2. Currency rates do not have nearly as much to do with trade balances as everyone had thought. This is not to say the 3-year-old Plaza Accord was a waste of time. It was a valuable beginning toward cooperation in an interdependent world. But this is where the comparison with Kellogg-Briand comes in. In 1985 as in 1928, agreements between nations depend on the signatories' willingness to adapt their national goals to the greater international good. And that is a hard sell. Currency rates will never be stable as long as nations pursue widely differing economic policies: abhorrence of inflation in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> vs. relative tolerance of it in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, for example. The gold standard for currencies forced policy coordination on the nations, but its fatal flaw was that it put all the burden of adjustment on weak-currency countries. That gave undue leverage to the slow-growth West Germanys of the world. Businesses want stable currency rates so they can plan where to locate plants, how much to manufacture for export, from which nations to buy components and so on. Three years after the Plaza Accord, however, the goal of stable currencies is beginning to look like a distant dream. Economists' estimates of the `` proper'' value of the dollar are all over the map, from 100 yen to 200 yen -LRB- the current rate is 134 -RRB- Differing economic policies have something to do with the instability, as do differing predictions for the trade deficit. Adding to the complexity is that trade flows are not the only controlling factor in rates. Investment flows are at least as important _ meaning that if Japanese for whatever reason crave <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Treasury bonds and factories, they will keep the dollar in strong demand even though they have little interest in importing American products. Stabilize currencies? Abolish war? Good luck.

 <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 1.2 billion bid for rival <ORGANIZATION> Irving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has staggered to the one-year mark with neither side ready to throw in the towel, or even call the outcome. At first, it had the distinction of being the first-ever hostile takeover fight between two big American banks. Now it has become the lengthiest such battle among major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporations. The strain of the bidding marathon clearly has taken its toll at both large <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> institutions by distracting management from their usual work, confusing stockholders and piling up millions of dollars in legal and other expenses. A third, friendly contender, Milan-based <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerciale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Italiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SpA </ORGANIZATION>, recently was forced out of the running due to an unfavorable ruling by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which is patiently overseeing the proposed merger process. `` It's the economic equivalent of the Iran-Iraq war because of the length and the substantial casualties,'' said <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, an attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>. `` At least we're not using poison gas,'' the bank's chairman, <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacot </PERSON>, said jokingly in a recent interview. `` Only ` poison pills' are involved.'' The outcome of the Irving-Bank of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> war, which began on Sept. 25, 1987, is likely to be decided in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state court, where, among other things, <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s `` poison pill'' anti-takeover defense is under attack. Some observers say the entire process could drag on into the winter. In the meantime, the takeover attempt appears to have turned into a struggle of personalities between <PERSON> Bacot </PERSON> and <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s equally strong-minded chairman, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> A. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>. Analysts say <PERSON> Bacot </PERSON> is determined to merge the two banks not only because the two would fit nicely together but because he fears <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> itself could become a takeover target if a big <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> or foreign bank decided to enter the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> market. A merger would nearly double <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>'s size, making it the 11th largest banking company in the country and a more elusive target. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, analysts say, has his own vision of running his bank and believes it is worth much more than the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>'s offer, especially given its past investments in technological advances. Both men have held only a handful of face-to-face meetings since <PERSON> Bacot </PERSON> formally proposed the merger, and each time talks have broken off without any signs of progress. No new talks are planned because, <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> said, `` we see absolutely nothing to be gained at this stage.'' `` I think the financial issues were certainly important to Irving early on and now, but ... it clearly has become a personal issue,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Starr </PERSON>, a banking analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Duff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phelps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, a partner of <ORGANIZATION> Sullivan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Cromwell </LOCATION>, which has represented many firms in takeovers, agreed. `` My own judgment is that they have created this fiction that the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> is evil and horrible ... It's almost a crusade.'' That is an unfortunate turn of events, many analysts contend, since both banks have similar markets and services and would work well together. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> has waged a tough defense to <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>'s persistent overtures, from poison pills to proxy fights A recently instituted `` flip-in'' provision to its poison pill would make an unsolicited merger prohibitively expensive by giving all <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> shareholders, except <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, the right to buy $ 400 of stock for $ 200 once <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> acquires 20 percent of <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>. `` The Irving board has taken enough action of a defensive nature and the burden is now on them to be able to show that they are not merely trying to entrench themselves and <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s management,'' said <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Nad </PERSON>, publisher of the monthly newsletter Directorship, an authority on corporate boards. `` That's a very fine line to walk.'' <PERSON> Bacot </PERSON> says he first broached the idea of a merger at a luncheon with <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> about five years ago. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> was n't very receptive then, he recalled. He conceded that <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> probably `` resents the fact we put an offer on the table like that'' after it had turned down the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> privately. What's particularly noteworthy about this battle is that it's occurring in an industry where hostile takeovers are rare Even in the best of circumstances, the complex, time-consuming regulatory requirements that other industries are spared could make some banks think twice about a merger. When the bid first emerged, some experts predicted hostile bids could become more commonplace, particularly among aggressive regional institutions. They're not so sure anymore. `` Hostile takeovers have no place in banking,'' <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> said recently. `` They are a severe threat to the stability of the banking industry and the soundness of the economy.'' New ground, though, was broken on the regulatory front. For one thing, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> declined to make any distinction between a friendly or hostile offer in approving <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>'s application in February. And in August, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> decided to treat foreign owners of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks much the same as domestic owners by requiring Instituto per la <ORGANIZATION> Ricostruzione </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industriale </ORGANIZATION>, the parent of `` white knight'' <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerciale </ORGANIZATION>, to apply separately to the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> IRI </ORGANIZATION>, which balked at the idea, is controlled by the Italian government and accounts for about a quarter of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s gross national product. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Falise </PERSON>, who says he was forced to devote all his time to the takeover fight, said <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> is negotiating with `` several'' foreign and domestic banks about a possible merger. However, analysts say if an offer happens to emerge it must be extremely attractive to win over shareholders at this late date. <ORGANIZATION> Banca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerciale </ORGANIZATION> had offered $ 84 a share for 51 percent of <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s approximately 18 million common shares outstanding before withdrawing its bid. The merger proposal was part of a complex defensive restructuring plan that included sale of Irving assets, cost-cutting measures and a special cash dividend. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, which owns about 4.9 percent of <LOCATION> Irving </LOCATION>, is offering $ 15 in cash and 1.575 shares of its own stock for each of <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>'s roughly 18 million common shares outstanding. <PERSON> Bacot </PERSON> maintains his bid is just as attracive now as it was a year ago, although the cash portion has declined significantly. If he had to do things over again, he'd still bid for <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bacot </PERSON> said. `` We would n't have stuck with it that long unless we felt that way,'' he said. `` It gets a little frustrating. You have to have a lot of patience.''

 Prices fell on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Thursday in modest trading, with activity again focused on takeover rumors following Wednesday's bid for <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fields </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>, which would be the largest ever takeover of a British company. Consolidated Gold Fields' shares, whose sharp gains Wednesday helped pull the entire market higher, were depressed Thursday as excitement subsided over <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>'s 2.9 billion-pound, or $ 4.8 billion, bid. But takeover speculation in half a dozen other stocks, sparked by the move on <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fields </ORGANIZATION>, buoyed the market against an otherwise bearish tone. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index closed 8.1 points, or 0.5 percent, lower at 1,788.7. Volume dropped to 393.6 million shares from 438.6 million shares Wednesday. Overall, losers among the market's 100 leading shares far outnumbered gainers, 61 to 22. The declines mirrored the mood on Wall Street, though late in the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> day the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average recovered and pushed to a slight advance. Consolidated Gold Fields ended 55 pence lower at 13.45 pounds, a relatively modest retreat after its 322-pence gain Wednesday.

<TEXT>
 Several senators today criticized airline deregulation and the rash of mergers it has spawned, complaining they have given large air carriers monopoly power in some parts of the country and resulted in higher fares but less service. `` Simply stated, people are paying more to fly today because the airlines have developed monopoly hubs,'' declared Sen. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. He complained that a fare from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, was $ 120 in 1977, before airline deregulation, but that recently he paid $ 510 for the same trip. But the committee at a hearing aimed at examining airline pricing practices were told by <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnley </PERSON> that air travelers have benefited by the deregulation of the industry with average air fares declining 13 percent in the last decade. He attributed an average 8 percent increase in domestic air fares during the first six months of the year to increased costs for fuel, new aircraft and a number of government-required safety initiatives. As an example of competition benefiting air travelers, <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> cited a recent decision by <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> to offer a $ 39 off-season fare between the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Airline deregulation has resulted in `` a substantial improvement in overall competition'' to the benefit of the public, insisted <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION>. But the explanation did n't satisfy a number of the senators including <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>; Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>, R-Mo., and Sen. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.D. </LOCATION>, who said fares and service to their parts of the country have suffered `` It's cheaper to fly across the nation than it is to fly across <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. That is a very bizarre situation,'' complained <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON>, who suggested `` some re-regulation'' would be in order that would require ticket prices to be linked to miles traveled. <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> and <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>, the ranking Repubican on the committee, also warned that airline fare and service practices could lead to some additional government controls on the industry. `` In certain airports competition does not exist. Airlines get a lock on an airport and when they get a lock they can do pretty much what they please,'' declared <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>. He cited <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> dominance at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> where the airline controls 83 percent of the flights since its merger two years ago with <ORGANIZATION> Ozark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION>, once its chief competitor. Single airlines also dominate at <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Burnley </LOCATION>, however, defended his department's approval of 21 airline mergers in recent years and maintained that even at the airports cited by the senators competition has been maintained. `` Not only has new entry -LRB- by airlines -RRB- occurred at each of these hubs, but competing incumbent carriers continue to provide competitive service,'' said <LOCATION> Burnley </LOCATION>. But when pressed by <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>, <PERSON> Burnely </PERSON> said the department has been disappointed at the level of competition as <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>' <LOCATION> Lambert </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION> since <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s merger with Ozark. He said the department had expected, for example, that <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> would move into the competitive void created by the TWA-Ozark merger with as many as 60 flights a day instead of the 22 or 23 flights a day it currently operates through <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. `` I'd like to know why that has occurred,'' said <LOCATION> Burnley </LOCATION>, promising the department would examine the competitive situation at the airport.

 Stock prices gave ground today in selling apparently prompted by impatience over the market's recent sluggish performance. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 12.26 to 2,078.24 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street. Losers outnumbered gainers by about 7 to 4 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 489 up, 836 down and 537 unchanged. Analysts said the market's sluggish recent behavior apparently convinced some investors that stocks were unable to break out of the trading range in which they have fluctuated for several months now. They also noted an absence of conviction about the business outlook to encourage any buying. Some prominent analysts and policymakers, including Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, have been warning of the dangers of revived inflation. Yet the price of gold, a primary gauge of inflationary expectations, has fallen below $ 400 an ounce this week for the first time in more than a year and a half. Similarly, brokers say, there is widespread confusion and uncertainty among investors about prospects for continued economic growth in 1989 under a new administration whose makeup and policies are not yet known.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> ruled today that the owners of the <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, nuclear power plant must prove they could one day pay to shut down the plant if they are to be allowed to operate. The commission voted unanimously to require the owners the submit a plan within 30 days that shows a `` reasonable assurance that adequate funding'' would be available for decommissioning the plant. Even if that issue is resolved, the commission still has another finance-related issue facing it _ whether the owners are financially qualified to operate the plant. <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> officials expressed confidence the decommissioning question would be resolved in their favor. `` We're in the process of answering those questions right now and we're confident this wo n't be an issue barring us from low-power testing,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sher </PERSON>, spokesman for the reactor's owner. Two financial problems with <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> prompted opponents to challenge the owners' financial fitness. In January, <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION>, the lead owner of the reactor, filed for bankruptcy reorganization. <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lando </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said last week that the commission would not approve a low-power license until it was satisfied <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> could run safely despite the bankruptcy proceedings. The second question revolves around the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wholesale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which in June withdrew from the project and halted its $ 2 million-a-month payments. <ORGANIZATION> MMWEC </ORGANIZATION> owns 12 percent of the plant and other <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> owners are working to secure investors to cover <ORGANIZATION> MMWEC </ORGANIZATION>'s payments through 1989. The idle $ 5.6 billion reactor is losing $ 50 million each month in maintenance and finance costs. If granted a low-power license, the reactor could operate at 5 percent of full power and would need to be granted a further permit to operate at more than 5 percent of capacity.

<TEXT>
 One of three Hunts facing a $ 134 million federal court judgment did not follow the lead of his brothers in filing personal bankruptcy petitions because he did not have as much potential exposure in the claim, a spokesman said Thursday. Heirs to one of the world's greatest fortunes, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, two of the multimillionaire <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> brothers, filed bankruptcy Wednesday. But attorneys say the filings wo n't affect previous Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings involving the brothers' <ORGANIZATION> Placid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, owned by their trust estates. Jurors in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> federal court decided Aug. 20 the two Hunts, their brother <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> and three other defendants must pay damages for conspiring in the late 1970s to corner the world's silver market, and ruining the investments of <ORGANIZATION> Minpeco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION>, the Peruvian government's mineral marketing company `` They -LRB- the brothers -RRB- are very upbeat. There is not anybody hanging their head over this,'' said a spokesman, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON>, executive vice president for the <ORGANIZATION> Hunt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. He said <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> did not file a personal bankruptcy petition because he does not have the exposure of the other two brothers. But the spokesman did not rule out the possibility of a later filing. `` It was his -LRB- <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON>'s -RRB- option not to file,'' said <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON>. `` He does not have the involvement in the potential silver litigation that <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> have. He does have some exposure, but not nearly as much.'' <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON> declined to discuss why <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> may be less involved in silver lawsuits than his brothers. The Hunts are optimistic about chances of getting a new trial or having damages reduced in their legal fight with the Peruvian government's mining company, said <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON>. `` This -LRB- reorganization -RRB- was a business decision, but they realized the decision would be painful to themselves and their family,'' the spokesman said. `` They are absolutely determined to fight this, what we are calling the outrageous Minpeco verdict.'' Meanwhile, the Chapter 11 reorganizations will avoid a `` fire sale'' in the wake of a required $ 225 million bond to appeal the court award to <LOCATION> Minpeco </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lasker </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> allowed a temporary stay against the bond. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, in a statement, said the personal filing will give him time `` to continue the fight to correct the injustice of the jury verdict .... The thought of even a dime going to the government of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> is repugnant.'' The Hunts maintain that <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, as the second-largest producer of silver in the world, could only have profited as the silver price rose. A <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, bankruptcy attorney who is general counsel to <ORGANIZATION> Placid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> said he was not surprised by the personal filings. `` The ensuing events in the silver market and their results have made it clear that the individual brothers would have to take some action to be able to operate their original businesses,'' said <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Anisman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Doby </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Wilson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Skillern </PERSON>. Confirmation hearings for Placid, which begin Monday before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Abramson </PERSON>, should be completed by the end of next week, he said. `` I do n't think it -LRB- the personal bankruptcy petitions -RRB- have any effect on Placid,'' he said. `` I believe Placid's reorganization will proceed and it will be a reorganized company. `` By the end of next week, we should have confirmation in which we satisfy that the plan is feasible, that the company can pay for everything the -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- Bankruptcy Code provides and, regarding deferred obligations, whether there is a reasonable basis for the business plan so that creditors who vote for the plan have a reasonable chance of getting their money,'' said <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON> said the two Hunts' personal bankruptcy petitions did not list value of their assets but that, `` as the case proceeds through the bankruptcy court, those values will be established.'' However, brief summaries of their assets detailed 13,649 Byzantine coins and 44 pieces of a Roman and Greek bronze collection for <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>'s petition noted ancient coins and `` various art objects and bronze statues.'' Bunker Hunt listed oil and gas properties in 40 counties nationwide, three gas plants, 14 ranches, 1,390 acres of raw land, a condo in <LOCATION> Kauai </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, five cars and a host of other assets, the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> listed half-interest in a ski lodge in <LOCATION> Vail </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION> between one-third and one-fourteenth interest in 3,442 acres in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, a 3-year-old Cadillac and a 15-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benz </ORGANIZATION>, according to the newspaper. Rarely have brothers <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> offered public glimpses of their empire, once valued at some $ 6 billion. But the silver crash prompted a $ 1.6 billion loss for Bunker and <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON>, who had bought 59 million ounces of silver, once estimated as one-third of the world's supply. Other heavy losses in oil and real estate have, according to some estimates, cut the trio's wealth to about $ 1 billion.

 Stock prices gave ground Thursday in selling apparently prompted by impatience over the market's recent sluggish performance. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down more than 18 points at its midafternoon low, closed with a 10.49 loss at 2,080.01. Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 8 to 5 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 556 up, 881 down and 518 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 150.67 million shares, up from 127.40 million Wednesday, when activity was curtailed somewhat by the observance of the Jewish holiday Yom Kippur. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 177.06 million shares. Analysts said the market's uninspired behavior of late apparently convinced some investors that stocks were unable to break out of the trading range in which they have fluctuated for several months now. They also noted an absence of conviction about the business outlook to encourage any buying. Some prominent analysts and policymakers, including Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, have been warning of the dangers of revived inflation. Yet the price of gold, a primary gauge of inflationary expectations, has fallen below $ 400 an ounce this week for the first time in more than a year and a half. Similarly, brokers say, there is widespread confusion and uncertainty among investors about prospects for continued economic growth in 1989 under a new administration whose makeup and policies are not yet known. Among actively traded blue chips, <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> dropped 1 \ to 112; <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- to 27 -RCB-; <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> -LCB- to 49 -LCB-; <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> -LCB- to 44 -LCB-, and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> \ to 26 Middle South Utilities, also among the volume leaders, rose -RRB- to 14 \, trading at a new 52-week high The company said it will consider more transactions like a sale-leaseback deal it announced earlier this week involving one of its nuclear power plants. Such transactions would stand to improve the company's prospects for restoring its dividend. <ORGANIZATION> Coleman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> rose 3 -LRB- to 39 -LRB-. Analysts said news of the death of the company's chairman prompted investors to conclude that it might become a takeover candidate. <ORGANIZATION> Reebok </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, which reported a higher order backlog than a year ago, rose | to 11 \ in active trading As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market lost $ 8.99 billion, or 0.30 percent, in value. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks dropped .56 to 152.08. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's industrial index fell 1.29 to 308.82, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index was down 0.98 at 269.18.

 The gas-guzzlers are back. The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s annual survey of auto gasoline mileage released Thursday shows more models than ever paying the special gas-guzzler tax on fuel-hungry cars, most of them expensive European luxury models. The mileage champs are unchanged for the fourth straight year. The top two cars are again Japanese: a <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> import and a <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>. In the luxury gas-guzzler category for the first time are two cars bearing American nameplates, the <ORGANIZATION> Cadillac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allante </ORGANIZATION> and the Chrysler TC by <PERSON> Maserati </PERSON>. Both have heavy Italian input _ the <ORGANIZATION> Cadillac </ORGANIZATION>'s body and more than half the car by value is imported from <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> is assembled in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> using many U.S-supplied components. These are not the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cars to pay the tax. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s venerable Chrysler Fifth Avenue and its nearly identical siblings, the Dodge Diplomat and the <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fury </ORGANIZATION>, were taxed in the 1987 model year. They return to official guzzler status for 1989, the last year of their production run, after a year with mileage ratings good enough to take them off the list. Many analysts have noted buyer indifference to fuel economy in recent years of stable or declining gasoline prices. The new models, though, reflect an increasing concern with high performance, according to one observer. `` If you have a car in your lineup that does not live up to its performance image, you're in more trouble today than if you have an official gas-guzzler,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a senior editor at <ORGANIZATION> Ward </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automotive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publications </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Ditlow </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, an advocacy group that has frequently opposed relaxation of government fuel standards, said: `` We are going in the wrong direction. We ought to be headed the other way and making gas-sippers.'' But manufacturers, he said, `` think they'll make more in profits than they pay in penalties.'' `` The tax really is n't objected to by the buyer'' of such luxurious chariots, said <PERSON> Kyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s Cadillac Division. `` It does not alter <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s commitment to stay away from the gas-guzzler tax on U.S.-built cars.'' The guzzlers are proliferating. For 1987, 18 models paid the tax. Last year, 24 models were taxed. This year 45 models are assessed, counting five Rolls-Royces that escaped previously because their gross vehicle weight exceeded 6,000 pounds, the cutoff specified by the law. The 1986 tax law changes closed that loophole. Other manufacturers with models subject to the tax are <ORGANIZATION> Maserati </ORGANIZATION> under its own name, <ORGANIZATION> Ferrari </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Porsche </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Aston-Martin </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Volvo </ORGANIZATION> and BMW. The Geo Metro recorded 53 miles per gallon in the city and 58 mpg on the highway. <PERSON> Geo </PERSON> is the new nameplate from <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for the various imports of its Chevrolet Division. The <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION>, built by <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Suzuki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> affiliate, was sold in previous years as the <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION>. Second place went to the two-seater <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> Civic CRX HF, also for the fourth year in a row, at 50 mpg city, 56 highway. Last year's ratings for the two cars were the same, with the exception that the Sprint recorded 54 mpg in city traffic. Engineers say repeat tests can yield different numbers, and this variability is probably what happened to the Fifth Avenue family, said <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Cervone </PERSON>. `` The car has not changed,'' he said. Yet in the 1987 model year it got 16 mpg in the city and 21 mpg on this highway; last year it was 17-23 and this year it is 16-23. The tax, enacted in 1975 to encourage efficiency when fuel shortages were feared, gradually tightened until reaching its present form for 1986 models. It is $ 500, the minimum, for the Fifth Avenue, Diplomat and Gran Fury. The Allante, a $ 50,000-plus two-seater, got an announced 16 mpg in the city and 24 mpg on the highway last year and was not taxed. It fell to 15 mpg city, 23 highway this year with the use of a larger engine. Buyers _ <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> has n't found many _ will have to pay $ 650 more. The taxed <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> TC </ORGANIZATION> by <LOCATION> Maserati </LOCATION> _ some models escape _ is the turbocharged version using the 2.5-liter -LRB- 152 cubic inches -RRB- engine and without top-gear `` lockup'' in the automatic transmission. It measured 17 mpg in the city and 21 mpg on the highway. Cough up another $ 500. The most fuel-profligate cars this year are four sports cars made by the British specialty manufacturer Aston-Martin and being sold in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for the first time, all rated 8-11. That's worth the top sticker addition of $ 3,850. Another 1975 law requires manufacturers and importers to meet minimum mileage standards averaged over their fleets, or face heavy fines. The current standard is 27.5 mpg, calculated from test results before <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> applies deflation factors to the mileages it publishes. The <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is considering a petition from <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> for a lower standard for 1989 and 1990, as the department permitted for 1986 through 1988. The tax applies to 22.5 mpg and below on the same calculation.

<TEXT>
 The two broadest measures of the nation's money supply rose in the week ended Sept. 12, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,037.1 billion in the week ended Sept. 12 from $ 3,035.7 billion the previous week. An even broader measure, M3, increased to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,853.4 billion from $ 3,849.5 billion. On the other hand, the narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell to a seasonally adjusted $ 782.1 billion from a revised $ 783.1 billion. M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations of $ 100,000. In judging its monetary policy, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has indicated it is monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the difference between short - and long-term interest rates It also has shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply measures. For the latest 13 weeks, M1 averaged $ 781.6 billion, a 6.1 percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 13 weeks. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said in mid-1988 that it reaffirmed its target for annual growth in M2 and M3 at between 4 percent and 8 percent, which is slightly lower than the 1987 target of 5.5 percent to 8.5 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has not set a specific target range for M1 since early 1987.

 The number of giant profitable corporations that legally paid no federal income tax was cut by more than half last year, according to a new study, but backers of the landmark 1986 tax overhaul said Thursday the figure may never drop to zero. Sixteen of 250 profitable companies surveyed by <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> were able to wipe out their entire federal liability, down from 40 in 1986 and 72 in 1982, according to Citizens for <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based research group funded by unions, churches and social groups. Some of the 16 disputed the report. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Huard </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION>, criticized the report for what he called `` this horror-story type of argument.'' It is unfair to look at a company's taxes for one year only, he said, adding that `` the nature of corporate profits and tax accounting being what it is, you are going to get these cyclical variations from year to year.'' Citizens for <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> said most of the change was caused by the sweeping law enacted in 1986, which reduced or removed several individual and corporate deductions and credits while cutting tax rates. `` Tax reform has passed the most critical test of its effectiveness,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McIntyre </PERSON>, director of the organization. `` Tax reform may not have have made things less complex ... -LRB- or -RRB- cut everyone's tax bill,'' <PERSON> McIntyre </PERSON> told a news conference. `` But tax reform has made great strides toward a system that puts all profitable corporations back on the tax rolls. And that should, over time, help restore public confidence in our tax system.'' Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>, R-Ore., and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, key authors of the 1986 law, voiced the same sentiments <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON> said he was surprised that the number of legal tax avoiders had dropped so quickly. Some companies continue to hold `` loss carrybacks,'' which are excess deductions that are used to wipe out past years' tax liabilities and generate a current-year refund, <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON> noted. As those carrybacks are used up, he predicted, the number of companies paying no tax will continue to dwindle. But there may never be a time when every profitable company pays a tax, he said, because `` companies may come up with things that we did n't think about'' when writing the law. The bigget single corporate tax benefit remains accelerated depreciation, which permits companies to recapture through the tax system part of the money spent for plant and equipment. The report listed these 16 companies as having paid no federal income tax last year: <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Aetna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Casualty, <ORGANIZATION> Baxter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travenol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Light, <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Corning </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION>, Greyhound, <PERSON> Ogden </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Sequa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Rubber, <ORGANIZATION> Consumers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utilities </ORGANIZATION>. All but <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> actually received refunds last year of past-year taxes, the report said. General Motors, largely due to increased depreciation of automaking equipment, received $ 742 million, while <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> received $ 123.5 million, in large part because of large tax payments to foreign countries, the report said. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartnett </PERSON> disputed the report's findings with regard to the auto company, saying <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> paid $ 73 million in federal income taxes in 1987. He said the company's 1987 tax liability was less than in past years `` because of our nominal <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> operating profit, our heavy investment in new and renovated plants and other factors.'' `` The report ... is wrong in saying that <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> paid no federal income tax last year,'' said <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marti </PERSON> <PERSON> Easterbrook </PERSON>. While the company will receive a refund, she said, `` our net tax payment -LRB- afer the refund -RRB- will be in the millions of dollars.'' <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Krupnick </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Aetna </ORGANIZATION>, denied the report's allegation that the giant insurer received a $ 32 million refund `` We sent in a check for $ 17 million and got no refund,'' she said. The annual survey of corporate taxes is based chiefly on stockholder reports filed by 250 of the nation's largest profitable corporations. The report deals only with taxes paid to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government during a given tax year and does not accout for deferrals that could fall due in a future year. Thus, an international company with large tax payments to foreign governments could be listed as paying no <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> taxes, as could one that bought a large amount of equipment last year, resulting in a deferral of liability. Among key findings: _ The 250 paid $ 9 billion more in federal income last year than they would have paid under the old law _ As a group, the 250 companies last year paid $ 27 billion in taxes on profits of $ 123 billion, a 22 percent rate Five years earlier, they paid less than 12 percent on $ 87 billion net earnings. _ The 14 largest corporations that paid no taxes in 1982 through 1985 paid at an effective rate of 30 percent last year This list included <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T, <ORGANIZATION> DuPont </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION>. _ The 128 corporations that were off the federal tax rolls in at least one year from 1981 through 1985 paid an average rate of 19.5 percent last year Their average rate in 1981-85 was 3.7 percent. _ The combined effective tax rate on the 250 corporations in the survey rose from 14.9 percent in 1981-85 to 22.1 percent in 1987 Their combined profits averaged $ 102 billion in each of the earlier years and $ 123 billion last year. _ The number of giant profitable companies paying a tax rate of less than 10 percent has been cut in half, to 55 _ About two-thirds of the 250 companies are paying a higher tax rate than before the new law was enacted About one-fifth are paying a lower rate.

 Members of a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee on Thursday faulted airline deregulation for raising airfares for many Americans and leaving some cities dominated by carriers that control local air service. But Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnley </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that even though `` the airline industry has its flaws,'' nearly 10 years of deregulation has benefited most travelers. `` Overall the airline industry has become much more competitive as to price and service as a result of economic deregulation,'' <PERSON> Burnley </PERSON> told the legislators. <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> cited statistics showing that since 1978, domestic air traffic has grown from 275 million passengers to more than 450 million, while average fares have declined 13 percent, adjusted for inflation. The secretary said that if most Americans are asked if deregulation has been helpful, `` You'll find an overwhelming perception that the country has benefited enormously.'' <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION>'s defense, however, did little to ease the concerns of members of the committee, many of whom come from sparsely populated states. `` My fares have zoomed up, up and away, and my service has gone down,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, chairman of the panel. <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> said it now costs him $ 510 to fly from <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, compared with $ 120 in 1977, before deregulation, which marks its 10th anniversary next month. Sen. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.D. </LOCATION>, said it costs $ 269 to fly from <LOCATION> Aberdeen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Rapid </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, while a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> ticket can cost $ 239. `` That is a very bizarre result,'' he said. `` Our small cities and towns are really suffering from this thing.'' Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the committee, also complained that some airlines have been able to dominate air traffic so thoroughly in individual cities that `` competition does n't really exist.'' He said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> must determine `` whether deregulation is truly working and if it's not working, what are we supposed to do about it.'' With the 1986 merger between <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ozark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> controls 82 percent of traffic at Lambert-St. Louis International Airport A report released Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, an investigating arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, found that after the merger, the number of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> routes served by two or more carriers fell from 64 to 36, while <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> fares from the city grew by 13 percent to 18 percent. <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON>, who was chief of the now-defunct <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> in 1978 when deregulation was created, told the senators that `` the airline industry is today far more competitive than it was under regulation.'' To deal with problems faced by cities dominated by individual airlines, he suggested tougher enforcement of antitrust laws when airline mergers are being considered, allowing foreign airlines to purchase <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> carriers, and taxing frequent flyer tickets to discourage repeated use of the same airline. When deregulation began, advocates argued that airlines would not be able to charge excessively high fares because competitors would be spawned who would set lower prices. But critics have argued that it has been difficult for new airlines to start up because of the high costs involved and the lack of available space at many airports. Competition has also been diminished by the 26 airline mergers since 1985, and the increased dominance by individual carriers at certain airports across the country. Both sides in the dispute generally agree that deregulation has benefited vacation travelers who are able to take advantage of the proliferation of discount fares. But passengers who must fly with insufficient advance notice or on inflexible schedules and those flying between small communities often find it difficult to find bargain fares. With <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> planning to adjourn next month, it is unlikely that any legislation directed at the problems cited will be passed this year. But lawmakers' comments made it clear that airline deregulation is likely to come under close scrutiny when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> returns in January.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is opening its doors to the once-feared copying machine through joint ventures with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> partners. Two copying ventures announced this week were hailed as landmarks in the policies of glasnost and perestroika, or openness and restructuring, begun by Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. AlphaGraphics Printshops of the Future, a <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, Ariz.-based chain of more than 250 print shops, announced on Thursday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that it plans to open its first two shops in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> this winter. <ORGANIZATION> AlphaGraphics </ORGANIZATION> said it will have two full-service shops that will primarily serve foreign businesses, members of the diplomatic press corps, Soviet government agencies and citizens who have access to hard currency. A day earlier, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopata </PERSON> held a news conference at the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Consulate </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> to announce plans to open kiosks in 18 hotels in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> this winter. The kiosks will offer overnight copying and printing services as well as selling computers and software, audio-visual products, advertising advice and American souvenirs, books and magazines, <PERSON> Lopata </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has long exercised tight control over access to copiers, duplicating machines and printing presses, all of which are owned by the state. Lack of access to such services has been an obstacle to the many unofficial newspapers and journals that have sprung up under glasnost. `` It's a very, very major political advance,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hough </PERSON>, a Soviet expert at <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` -LRB- Copying -RRB- machines have been under lock and key and it's been virtually illegal for most people to make copies in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Frazer </PERSON>, program officer at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, called the venture `` extremely radical because even most Soviet government bureaucrats do not have access to copying machines.'' AlphaGraphics is planning larger and more complete copying operations than <PERSON> Lopata </PERSON>, who plans to use the kiosks as collection points for copying that will be done at a central location. A 50-pound document that would cost $ 600 to $ 700 and take four days or so to ship from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> could be sent electronically and printed at an AlphaGraphics shop for about $ 30, without danger of being stuck in customs, said <PERSON> Rodger </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, the president and founder. <PERSON> Lopata </PERSON> said he sees his venture as a starting point for a wide variety of businesses. `` This is a truly pioneering event,'' <PERSON> Lopata </PERSON> told a crowded news conference Wednesday. `` This will also be one of the first facilities to allow printing to the average Soviet citizen.'' <PERSON> Lopata </PERSON> said the new business will be open to all Soviets, charging rubles and dollars. Plans are to open offices in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in January, <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> next summer and <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> a few months later, he said. The joint venture is an outgrowth of the <LOCATION> Gorbachev-Reagan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit meeting earlier this year, said Soviet Deputy Consul General <PERSON> Gennadiy </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zolotov </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lopata </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Unicorn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> is in a venture with MIR, the Soviet publishing house, and the Soviet cooperative <PERSON> Sintez </PERSON>. Dubbed Sovaminco, standing for <ORGANIZATION> Soviet-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the business was registered as a legal entity this week in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Zolotov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lopata </PERSON>. The company is jointly owned by <ORGANIZATION> MIR </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Sintez </PERSON> and Unicorn. AlphaGraphics' franchisee, Toronto-based <ORGANIZATION> Phargo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consulting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, is in a venture with <ORGANIZATION> Kniga </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>.

 The dollar gained ground in quiet trading Thursday despite a bout of central bank intervention. Gold prices fell overseas but recovered somewhat in domestic dealings. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted bullion at $ 399 a troy ounce, up from $ 396.35 late Wednesday, when the metal slid below the $ 400-an-ounce level for the first time in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since early last year. Dealers attributed the rise in domestic gold prices to technical factors. Trading in currency markets was dull. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Holland </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Discount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> intervened when the dollar topped 1.88 West German marks. Because the market was thin, `` it did n't take much to turn the dollar around,'' he said. Many dealers were waiting on the sidelines for Saturday's meeting of the leading industrialized democracies While no policy changes are expected to result from the Group of Seven gathering in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, a cloud of caution still hung over the markets. The G-7 nations include the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>.

In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where the business day ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s begins, the dollar rose 0.29 Japanese yen to a closing 134.47 yen. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it fell to 134.45 yen. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar rose to 134.69 yen from 134.29 yen on Wednesday.

Later in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, it cost $ 1.6702 to buy one pound, less expensive than Wednesday's $ 1.6738. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Wednesday's rates, included: 1.8763 West German marks, up from 1.8745; 1.5851 Swiss francs, up from 1.5820; 6.3860 French francs, up from 6.3650; 1,399.25 Italian lire, up from 1.395.75, and 1.2187 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2159.

<HEAD>Late Rally Called Key Reversal For Grain Futures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 A late rally that pushed grain and soybean futures prices higher Thursday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> could mark a key reversal in the market's recent downward trend, analysts said. On other markets, gold struggled back to $ 400 an ounce; copper surged; frozen pork bellies rose sharply while livestock futures were mixed; energy futures were mostly higher; and stock-index futures retreated. Soybeans for November delivery, which had traded as high as $ 9.03 -LCB- a bushel just one week earlier, swung in a 28-cent range Thursday, plunging to $ 8.15 but settling near the day's high at $ 8.42, 4 -LCB- cents above Wednesday's final price. Corn and wheat futures also finished moderately higher but were less volatile due to the supportive influence of new export business, analysts said. `` The -LRB- soybean -RRB- market liquidated early until there just was n't any selling left below $ 8.20 Then the strength in the wheat and corn really supported the bean complex,'' said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON>, a grain analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> futures brokerage. `` I think the market told us today that it's in good shape,'' he said. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>, grain specialist with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the drop to $ 8.15 `` appears now in hindsight to have been the end of the liquidation,'' he said. `` Today could be a bullish key reversal,'' agreed <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Balletto </PERSON>, soybean market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Much of the buying apparently was based on indications of increased global demand for grain and soybeans, particularly by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. A large purchase this week of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybean oil by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> also supported the soybean complex, analysts said. Talk that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> were nearing agreement on a new long-term grain agreement further fueled the rally, analysts said. Wheat settled 5 -LCB- cents to 6 -RCB- cents higher with the December contract at $ 4.26 -LCB- a bushel; corn was -RCB- cent to 3 -LCB- cents higher with December at $ 2.91 \ a bushel; oats were unchanged to 4 \ cents higher with December at $ 2.58 \ a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent lower to 5 \ cents higher with November at $ Silver futures posted solid gains on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Commodity Exchange and gold for October delivery rallied to $ 400 a troy ounce, the psychologically important level the contract had breached a day earlier. `` My gut feeling is that there's not much of any significance here,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbanel </PERSON>, director of futures trading for <ORGANIZATION> Gruntal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. He said the inflation-sensitive gold market reacted to higher grain prices but that the lack of strong inflationary signals would continue to depress speculative buying. Buying could surface below $ 390 a troy ounce, a level that gold is likely to reach within two or three weeks, he said. Gold settled 60 cents to 80 cents higher with October at $ 400 a troy ounce; silver was 7.1 cents to 7.3 cents higher with September at $ 6.25 a troy ounce. Copper futures soared on the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, resuming a month-long upward trend linked to tight supplies and growing demand, analysts said. Copper settled 1.8 cents to 3.05 cents higher with September at $ 1.1535, a new lifetime high for that contract. Frozen pork belly futures surged as much as 1.82 cents a pound on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in a technical rally in the absence of fresh supply-and-demand factors, analysts said. Hog futures were mostly higher in anticipation of a heavy weekend kill and cattle futures were mixed. The bearish effect of weaker cash cattle markets was offset by expectations for higher cash prices, analysts said. Live cattle settled .40 cent lower to .43 cent higher with October at 69.40 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .55 cent lower to .02 cent higher with September at 79.20 cents a pound; hogs were unchanged to .57 cent higher with October at 39.25 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .95 cent to 1.82 cents higher with February at 52.15 cents a pound. Oil futures prices ended mostly higher on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as the market awaited this weekend's <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> price committee meeting. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 5 cents to 9 cents higher with November at $ 14.65 a barrel; heating oil was .03 cent lower to .07 cent higher with October at 41.06 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .10 cent lower to .50 cent higher with October at 45.85 cents a gallon. Stock-index futures retreated on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for December delivery of stocks on the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled 1.2 points lower at 272.10.

<HEAD>Bond Prices End Slightly Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Bond prices finished slightly lower Thursday in sporadic trading, failing to sustain their early gains of the session. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s closely watched 30-year issue slipped \ point, or $ 2.50 for every $ 1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves inversely to its price and is often an indicator of interest rate trends, rose to 9.03 percent from 9.01 percent late Wednesday. Analysts said bond prices advanced early in the trading day in response to Wednesday's positive news on inflation, but lost ground later as gold prices rebounded. The government reported Wednesday that while consumer prices rose 0.4 percent in August, inflation remained in check at the same 5.2 percent annual rate as in July. `` That makes bonds look good,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sebastian </PERSON>, executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Clayton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, an investment firm in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Gold prices continued to slump early in the session, trading below $ 400 a troy ounce. The news on consumer prices and the fall in gold were positive for bond prices, because they indicate an absence of inflationary pressures. But the bond market's early gains soon were eroded when gold recovered, analysts said. The metal finished in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> at around $ 399 an ounce, up from $ 396.35 late Wednesday. In the secondary market for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds, prices of short-term government issues slipped 1-32 point to 3-32 point, intermediate maturities declined 3-32 point to 3-16 point, and 20-year issues were down \ point, according to <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a financial information service. The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $ 10 in the price of a bond with a $ 1,000 face value. The <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Bond Index, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, fell 1.48 to 1,143.46. Meanwhile, corporate bonds inched higher. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, was up 0.09 at 290.13. Yields on three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills, meanwhile, rose 2 basis points to 7.41 percent and a discount rate of 7.19 percent. Yields on six-month bills jumped 5 basis points to 7.78 percent and a discount of 7.40 percent. Yields on one-year bills rose 3 basis points to 8.05 percent and a discount rate of 7.52 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the annualized return on an investment in a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bill. The discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at maturity. The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was quoted late in the day at 8 5-16 percent, down from 8 ~ percent late Wednesday

 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> failed Thursday to break a Republican filibuster of a bill clouded in presidential politics to raise the $ 3.35 an hour minimum wage for the first time since 1981. On a 53-43 vote _ seven short of the 60 needed _ the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> refused to limit to 30 more hours debate on legislation by Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., to raise the wage floor to $ 3.75 in January, $ 4.15 in 1990 and $ 4.55 in 1991 `` It's only clear that there is a deliberate attempt to stall action on this bill,'' said Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, who called the Republican tactics a Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, the leader of the Republican opposition to any increase in the minimum wage that does not include a subminimum wage for new hires, said the issue needs extended debate. `` I know a little bit about filibustering and I've certainly led my share around here,'' <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said. `` But I only lead them on very, very important issues where we really have to have extended debate or what I would call extended educational dialogue. This particular bill needs a lot of that.'' <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> a week ago introduced the first Republican amendment in the debate _ a 90-day, 80 percent subminimum wage applicable to all new hires. As a parlimentary tactic, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> immediately offered a substitute amendment slightly expanding a currently allowed but little used 85 percent subminimum wage for full-time students who work no more than 20 hours a week. Since then, there have been no votes in five days of debate. Under the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s rules, approval of <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s substitute would effectively kill what Republicans call a subminimum training wage that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> have coupled to their approval of any incease in the $ 3.35 wage floor. `` We're not going to get a fair hearing on the training wage because the labor leaders do n't want it,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. `` It's not the Republicans versus the Democrats; it's the Republicans versus the labor leaders. They're telling us we can take this or leave it; we're not going to play that game. <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said Republicans supporting the filibuster `` obviously know that the presidential nominee of their party, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, was n't serious when he told Americans he wanted an increase in the minimum wage.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has declined to specify in the past two weeks how a big an increase in the minimum wage he could support, saying any raise should be coupled to a subminimum training wage. His vice presidential running mate, Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, R-Ind., this week again mentioned a raise to $ 4 over two years, a proposal he submitted to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> two months ago <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> scheduled a second cloture vote for Friday in an effort to break the logjam amid indications that some of the support for the filibuster may be waning. `` We may not be successful tomorrow, but we're going to try,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. Three Republicans _ Sens. <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> _ joined 50 Democrats in Thursday's vote to end the filibuster. Three Democrats _ Sens. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Exon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelby </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> _ joined Republians in voting to allow it to continue. `` It's an open secret in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> that the White House has asked the Republicans to vote in favor of a filibuster,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. `` And the <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION> has asked them to keep on voting for a filibuster tomorrow and next week.'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and other supporters of a minimum wage increase say it would only restore the 30 percent loss of purchasing power that inflation has taken away from workers on that `` bottom rung'' since it was last raised in 1981. Proponents said the raise will directly benfit some 15 million workers now paid below $ 4.55 an hour. <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, however, said only about 2 million of the minimum wage earners are what he called `` working poor'' heads of households. `` The minimum wage really is irrelvevant except that by pushing up the bottom some 38 percent ... every other wage scale in the country has to go up correspondingly, and the cost of every good and service in this country has to go up correspondingly,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> estimates that raising the minimum wage would increase the rate of inflation by 0.2 to 0.3 percentage points a year. Inflation so far the first eight months of 1988 is running at 4.6 percent.

The case was transferred to state district court in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> so it could be decided by Friday, when some <PERSON> Gearhart </PERSON> creditors had the right to withdraw their consent to the merger. `` We decided to withdraw our case,'' said <PERSON> Dusek </PERSON>, adding that the antitrust questions no longer existed. `` There is an agreed, final judgment.'' <PERSON> Mattox </PERSON> had contended the merger would eliminate competition in the wireline services industry. The attorney general's challenge came only days after <ORGANIZATION> Halliburton </ORGANIZATION> had reached a final agreement on the merger with <PERSON> Gearhart </PERSON> debtholders and creditors. The merger also had won the approval of <PERSON> Gearhart </PERSON> shareholders and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gearhart </PERSON>, a struggling Fort Worth-based oilfield services company that employs 7,000 people worldwide, said it would file for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings if the merger was not completed.
