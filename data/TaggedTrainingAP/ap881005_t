 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sought a temporary restraining order Wednesday in an attempt to stop the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> from barring newly sentenced prisoners from its overcrowded jail facilities. The department filed suit in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> after the district failed to accept the federal government's offer of short-term help to alleviate jail overcrowding in exchange for a commitment by the district to quickly increase its space for housing prisoners. The offer by Associate Attorney General <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> would have assigned to federal prison facilities up to 200 newly sentenced people. That offer would have lasted until Oct. 14, and the city would have resumed accepting prisoners Oct. 17. Under the offer, the people temporarily housed in federal facilities from Oct. 4 to Oct. 14 would have been returned to the district by Jan. 1. The city had until 3:30 p.m. Wednesday to accept the offer and did not do so, said a statement issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Federal prisons now hold nearly 2,000 city prisoners. The crisis was triggered last Thursday, when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>'s ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to comply with a court-ordered inmate cap at the jail. He gave the District a five-day grace period before the decree took effect at noon Tuesday. An appeals court decision, handed down the same day as <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>'s ruling, requires the <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to bring the population at the overcrowded Central Facility at <LOCATION> Lorton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> in line with a court-ordered cap by Nov. The <ORGANIZATION> D.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> closed its overcrowded prison system to new inmates Tuesday to comply with the court order, and placed responsibility for housing them in the hands of the attorney general. In a six-page letter to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> said the pace of new prison construction in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> `` has been totally inadequate.'' `` The District has been unwilling to take the obvious emergency measure of placing on vacant sites within the District the modular facilities which other jurisdictions have used to provide quick accommodations for excess prison populations,'' said <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>. The city submitted a report to <LOCATION> Bryant </LOCATION> on Wednesday morning explaining its plan for reducing the jail population, a spokeswoman for <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> said. In addition to closing the prison system, the city announced plans to release 350 inmates early, transfer 130 to penal institutions in other states, and hire contractors to post bond for some indigent inmates awaiting trial. District of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> and federal officials met for hours Wednesday in an unsuccessful effort to resolve their differences. Meanwhile, the <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> police department's traffic branch holding cell was turned over to the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> to house some prisoners temporarily, according to police spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON>. And police station houses were placed on alert to prepare to accept overflow prisoners.

 <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said he thought he `` did fine'' in Wednesday night's vice presidential debate, and that Republican opponent <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> did not adequately explain what he would do if he suddenly became president. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> received a telephone call from Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> immediately after the debate, then left for a rally at a nearby hotel. There, the Democratic vice presidential nominee was cheered by 700 supporters. A large sign declared, `` And the winner is <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>.'' Asked if he thought he had won the debate, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said, `` I think I did fine, and I enjoyed it. I had fun. I think we made our points.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> referred to the repeated questioning of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> about the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee's qualifications to assume the presidency. `` I stood up there for 90 minutes listening to Senator <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> say what he was going to do if he was president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and I still did n't know. Finally I realized all he was going to do was go back to that script again,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> called <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> to wish him well before the debate. The Democratic ticket planned a reunion Thursday at a steel plant rally near <LOCATION> Longview </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> on Tuesday night after four days of intense preparations, first in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and then in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. He took time to spend with his wife and three children and planned to work out in the hotel gym to help him relax before the debate. B.A. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> accompanied her husband to the private tour of the debate site Wednesday afternoon. Afterward, according to press secretary <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, 67, picked up his wife and carried her off the stage. `` She looked like she was willing to go with him anywhere,'' he said. Much of his preparation was devoted to making <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> comfortable with the format of the debate, which limited the candidates to two-minute answers and one-minute responses, aides said. `` It's a matter of taking the language of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and putting it in a form that's suitable for television,'' <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON> said. Although his advisers admitted helping <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> `` frame his answers,'' <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON> said, `` we have not armed him with a lot of cute one-liners. That's not really his style.'' `` I think we'll leave the one-liners to <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Ailes </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dach </PERSON>, referring to the Republican media strategist who has been coaching the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidate. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and other Democrats have tried to exploit public uneasiness about <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s qualifications for the job, and public polls show <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is a drag on the Republican ticket. A strong performance by the 41-year-old <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> could turn that around. `` I do n't think people are going to judge this just by the fact he does n't stumble,'' <PERSON> Dach </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> needed `` an extremely strong performance'' to overcome the public's doubts.

 Republicans declared that <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> exceeded expectations in the vice presidential debate Wednesday night, while Democrats said the confrontation demonstrated <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s experience and qualifications for president As expected, reaction to the 90-minute debate held in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, and broadcast nationally, was strongly partisan, with backers of Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> praising <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s performance, and supporters of Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, declaring <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> the victor. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> described President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as `` gratified'' by the outcome and said the president called <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> to congratulate him. Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> said, `` Neither scored a knockout, but <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> looked and sounded more presidential.'' `` I do n't think there's any question <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> made himself an asset to the ticket tonight,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, a national co-chairman of the <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign. `` Prior to tonight he was not.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s jibe at <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> when the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator compared his experience to that of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> drew a mixed reaction. `` <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was a friend of mine,'' the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat told <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. `` Senator, you're no <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>.'' `` That was uncalled for, senator,'' retorted <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. `` It threw a chill over the whole debate, a sour note,'' said Atlanta-based pollster <PERSON> Clairbourne </PERSON> <PERSON> Darden </PERSON>. `` It changed from then on, the way you looked at <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>.'' But Democrats said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> looked bad when he tried to compare himself with <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. `` I think <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s worst moment was when he tried to cpmpare himself to <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>,'' said Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> -RRB- was forced to think for himself and it did n't go over,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Tenn. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Teichner </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> pollster, said he saw no clear winner `` Because of the low expectations for <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, the polls will probably show that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> probably won,'' said <PERSON> Teichner </PERSON>. `` As for whether the debate will help in the overall race, I think it's a wash.'' <PERSON> Merle </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, a political scientist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` I think <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> did a better job I think the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ticket ought to be helped by his performance.'' But he also praised <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> who, he said, `` performed well enough that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign will not have to engage in extensive damage control after tonight. But I think he was out-debated by <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Neuman </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voters </ORGANIZATION>, called the debate a draw. `` I do n't see that one outshone the other particularly,'' she said. `` I think they came off pretty well as they intended. Whether the voters won, I'm still trying to figure out.''

<HEAD>Haitian Merchants Block Dominican Consulate; Priest Applauds

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ About 100 Haitian merchants blocked the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> consulate Wednesday, claiming Dominican soldiers were confiscating their goods, Radio Haiti-Inter reported. In another development, the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> priest who escaped injury when thugs massacred his parishioners three weeks ago made his first public comment on the attack Wednesday and applauded the Haitian soldiers' rebellion. The merchants, who in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> resell merchandise bought in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, claim the incidents occurred from Sept. 26 to Oct. 1. Most of the incidents occurred at <LOCATION> Barahona </LOCATION>, a small town in southwestern <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> near the Haitian border. The merchants claimed the Dominicans said it was `` a special control'' measure ordered by Dominican President <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Balaguer </PERSON>. An unidentified witness alleged the soldiers pointed their rifles at them and confiscated the goods to sell them. In a recorded radio address broadcast by local stations, the Rev. <PERSON> Jean-Bertrand </PERSON> <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON> paid tribute to the 13 parishioners who died and the more than 70 who were wounded Sept. 11 when men with guns, machetes and metal skewers attacked his St. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> church. `` Like <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>, the victims of the massacre of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bosco </ORGANIZATION> fell in a bloodbath of love for the liberation of their country,'' <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON>, an advocate of Marxist liberation theology who has been condemned by the church hierarchy, saluted `` the valiant soldiers who have decided to continue the house-cleaning operation.'' But he did not praise Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Prosper </PERSON> <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>, the country's new leader, associating him with other officiers linked to the <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> regimes of the past. `` The people do not trust you; -LRB- the people -RRB- should consider all bigshot Duvalierists as big-time criminals until they prove the contrary for the rest of their lives,'' he said in remarks addressed to <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>. Rank-and-file soldiers of the Presidential Guard, upset by the church massacre and other government-sponsored violence, overthrew military ruler Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> on Sept. 17 and sent him into exile in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. They named <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> as his successor and accused <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION> Mayor Mayor <PERSON> Franck </PERSON> <PERSON> Romain </PERSON> of masterminding the massacre. The enlisted men ousted many of their unpopular commanding officers in the week following the coup, while the general populace hunted down, stoned to death and burned a number of Tonton Macoutes believed responsible for the church massacre. The Macoutes are former members of the private militia of the <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> family dictatorship that ruled <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> for 29 years until <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> was ousted and exiled in February 1986. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> has been identified for years as a staunch <ORGANIZATION> Duvalierist </ORGANIZATION> and became a multimillionaire as financial advisor to the dictator's family

 Republican vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said Wednesday night that he did `` great'' in his debate with <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and said he was pleased at being grilled three times about his qualifications for higher office. `` We were delighted that they brought it up three different times because it gave us three different times to talk to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people about what I'll do for the country,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said as he left the Civic Auditorium where the debate was held and headed toward a post-debate rally. Asked about his performance, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> smiled at reporters and said, `` Great.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Prosperi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s spokesman, said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> received congratulatory calls after the debate from Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. He quoted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as telling his running mate, `` You did great.'' `` Thank you very much,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, according to <PERSON> Prosperi </PERSON>. At the rally at an outdoor park following the debate, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> asked 2,000 flag-waving supporters, `` Did we win the debate?'' They shouted back: `` Yes.'' Referring to Wednesday's <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> playoff game in which the <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletics </ORGANIZATION> beat the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION> 2-1, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, `` This afternoon, the team from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> lost, and tonight, the man from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> lost.'' Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> had made `` absolutely no response to the fact that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is simply out of step with mainstream <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' `` After tonight, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has a little better picture of the road that we want to take right into the 21st Century,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. As he was leaving the rally to head for his hotel room, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was asked by reporters about <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s comment during the debate that `` You're no <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>.'' `` It was uncalled for,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. Before the debate, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, in a jocular mood, had admonished the press to `` Watch us carefully. Take good notes. Good news stories now.'' `` I feel good,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said as he left his hotel for the debate. Earlier Wednesday, the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator, wearing makeup for his morning rehearsal before the cameras and tour of the Civic Auditorium stage with his top aides, looked confident and relaxed. `` We're ready,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told reporters as he emerged from his hotel. Asked if he was nervous, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> replied, `` Not yet.'' `` The mike works. That's very important to make sure the mike works and ours is working well,' he said as he left the debate hall. As for <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, his Democratic counterpart, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> joked, `` I just hope he shows up.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had a low-key day as he prepared for the debate. He spent the afternoon relaxing in his hotel room, except for a brief walk outside. When reporters asked about his debate strategy, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, `` We do n't want to give any strategies away.'' But, he said: `` You're going to see <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as he really is. You're going to see the real <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and his aides telegraphed his strategy days ago, saying the focus would be on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> rather than <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, who the Republicans say is closer to them than the Democrats on many issues. `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is running for president, and he's the one I'm very concerned about becoming president,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told reporters Tuesday. `` It would be a very troubling notion for many Americans.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> took part in two mock debates this week with Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>, R-Ore., who played <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, and has had dozens of issues briefings He said <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON> and his briefing team `` thought of every tough question you could possibly think of'' during the rehearsals. `` I gave brilliant answers,'' he said.

 Here are excerpts from Wednesday night's debate between vice presidential candidates Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, and Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, R-Ind
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 Question: Why do you think that you have not made a more substantial impression on some of these people who have been able to observe you up close? Quayle: ... Qualifications for the office of vice president or president are not age alone ... Let's look at the three biggest issues that are going to be confronting <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in the next presidency. Those three issues are national security and arms control, jobs and education, and the federal budget deficit. On each one of those issues I have more experience than does the governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. ... <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>: This debate tonight, is not about the qualifications for the vice presidency. No, the debate tonight, is a debate about the presidency itself, and a presidential decision that has to be made by you. The stakes could not be higher. Question: If you had to step in to the presidency, who's agenda would you pursue? Yours, or -LRB- <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' -RRB-? <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>: ... We agree on so many things, and the vast majority of the issues. We agree on the fact that we have to cut this deficit ... Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and I agree that we ought to have a trade policy for this country, that we've seen this administration more than double the national debt, that they've moved this country from the No. 1 lender nation in the world to the No. 1 debtor nation in the world under their administration, that they have not had a trade policy, that they've let trade be a handmaiden for the foreign policy objectives of the country, that this country has exported too many jobs and not enough products. ... Quayle: ... Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, one of the most liberal governors in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, ... raised taxes five times. He just raised taxes this last year, and that's why a lot of people refer to him `` Tax Hike <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>.'' That's why they refer to the state of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> as Taxachusetts. ... Question: ... Are n't you and Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> using -LRB- Social Security -RRB- politically, rather than dealing with it responsibily? <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>: ... We have a contract with the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people on Social Security, and <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> is an issue where Sen. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> voted eight times to cut the benefits on Social Security. ... Now, when you talk about Social Security the people that are going to protect it are the Democrats who brought forth that program. ... Quayle: Sen. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, you know that I did not vote to cut Social Security benefits eight times. What I have voted for, and what Sen. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> has voted for, is to delay the cost-of-living adjustments. ... You're right, they use this for political advantage. What they try to do time and time again is to scare the old people of this country. ... Question: ... Do you consider yourself an environmentalist? And, if you do, how do you reconcile that with your voting record? Quayle: I have a very strong record on the environment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. ... I have voted for the major pieces of environmental legislation that have come down and been voted on in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. ... If you bring up the environment, you ca n't help but think about the environmental policy of the governor of <LOCATION> Massachsetts </LOCATION>. ... The <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> which is the dirtiest waterway in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. ... What has the governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> done about that? Virtually nothing. ... <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>: ... We're the authors, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, of <ORGANIZATION> Clean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, of Clean Water, of the Superfunding. I'm one who played a very major role in passing the Superfund legislation. And every environmental organization that I know, every major one has now endorsed the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket. ... Question: I'd like for you to ... explain ... your votes against the school breakfast program, the school lunch program and the expansion of the child immunization program. Quayle: ... I have a very good record and a commitment to the poor, to those that do n't have a family, want to have a family. This administration and a <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will be committed to eradicating poverty. ... The poverty program we are going to concentrate on is creating jobs and opportunities so that everyone will have the opportunities that they want. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>: ... What also frustrates me ... is the kind of votes he's cast against child nutrition programs, the fact that he has voted against money that we needed for further immunization, the denial of polio shots to kids where the parents could n't afford to get that kind of a shot. Now I do n't really believe that is identifying with the concerns of people in poverty. Question: ... You and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> seem to be diametrically opposed on -LRB- Contra aid -RRB-. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>: Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and I have disagreed on the Contra program ... But my big difference with this administration is they look at the Contra aid program as the only way to resolve that problem. ... I believe that you have to work with the leaders of those other Central American countries to try to bring about the democratization of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> ... Quayle: There's no doubt, in a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> administration that the aid would be cut off to the democratic resistance in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and that is unfortunate. ... Question: Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has tried to make ethics a major issue in the campaign. And he has you as a running mate, a man who leads the league, at last count, in the receipt of PAC money ... Do you find that embarrassing, Senator? <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>: No, I do n't ... Wwhat I've done in PAC money is just what my opponent in my campaign has done in his campaign. ... So what you have to do is comply with the laws as they are ... I have been for campaign reform and have pushed it very hard. ... But I've noticed that the senator from <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> has opposed that campaign reform and voted repeatedly against it ... Quayle: Senator <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is the number one PAC raiser. As a matter of fact, he used to have a $ 10,000 Breakfast Club. ... It only cost high-paid lobbyist special interests in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to come down and have breakfast with the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committe </ORGANIZATION> _ the one that oversees all the tax loopholes in the tax code _ $ 10,000. I'm sure they were n't paying to have Corn Flakes.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> praised running mate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s performance in the nationally televised debate Wednesday night with rival <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, saying <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> hit a `` home run'' on his first answer. `` He's doing good, good opening, strong opening, right out of the ball park, the <PERSON> Canseco </PERSON> of American politics,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters, referring to <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> A </ORGANIZATION>'s baseball player <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Canseco </PERSON>. `` He hit it the first answer, home run.,'' Asked if the question to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> _ a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> senator from <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> _ on criticisms of his qualifications was a fair one, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied, `` Everything's fair in this business ... I'd like to get a slow ball like that in the first one. It's easy.'' After the debate, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> to congratulate him, according to <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Prosperi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s spokesman. He quoted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as telling his running mate, `` You did great.'' `` Thank you very much,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, according to <PERSON> Prosperi </PERSON>. The vice president, who had arrived at his hotel here in time to watch <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> take on <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> senator from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, had invited reporters to watch the first question with him. `` Deja vu ... same podiums we used,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> commented, referring to his debate with Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. His concern with staging was evident as he commented on <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s position when he shook hands with <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> `` Full-faced, looks good,'' he said, then added, laughing, `` Full-face, turn, it's a very important thing.'' Earlier Wednesday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had taken some time out from campaigning to telephone <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and wish him well in the debate, according to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief of staff, <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>.

 An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> panel of veteran debate judges called <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> the winner by a wide margin over <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> in their vice presidential debate Wednesday night. An instant <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll also gave the victory to the Democratic nominee. ABC News polled 637 registered voters immediately after the debate. Fifty-one percent said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> had won, 27 called <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> the winner and 22 percent said it was a tie. The debate also swayed some undecided voters over to the Democratic ticket. In a survey prior to the debate, 50 percent said they favored <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> while 45 percent picked <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and 5 percent were undecided. After the debate, the same people favored <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with 50 percent, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> received 48 percent and 2 percent were unsure. Eighty-seven percent said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was qualified to become president, 12 percent said he was n't and 1 percent was undecided. Asked whether <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was qualified to assume the presidency, 48 percent said yes, 49 percent said no and 3 percent were undecided. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.5 percent. The AP panel of six debate judges, unanimous in calling <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> the winner, scored the contest 148-125 for the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator. Some panel members pointed to <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s statement that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was `` no <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'' as the turning point of the debate. <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxcy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, the director of forensics at <ORGANIZATION> Emory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, scored it 24-22 for <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. `` I thought <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> really held his own until we got to the <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> question,'' she said. `` It was like a father putting down a child. I thought the momentum turned then.'' `` Up to that point <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> had not answered the breakfast club questions well. But after that, it was almost like he got more confidence,'' said <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>. `` It was almost like the <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> question fueled <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> for the rest of the debate.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Unger </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forensics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> panel, picked <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> 25-17. He said, `` <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> generally lived down to his expectations. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> lived up to and even above his. In fact, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> made a better case for <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> than <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON>, national executive secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forensic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ripon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, said itwas the best of any of the presidential or vice-presidential debates since 1976. <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON>, who scored it 25-22 for <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> `` chose to ignore questions that were being asked and instead to attack <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and to bring in political themes of his own choosing.'' He said some of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s `` slash-and-burn attacks were reminiscent of Sen. -LRB- Bob -RRB- <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'' in the 1976 vice presidential debate against <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>. <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, with his `` very avuncular manner,'' stuck closer to the debate format. But he added that the panel of reporters also gave <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> `` as harsh a grilling as I have ever seen.'' <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mancuso </PERSON>, director of intercollegiate forensics for the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION>, scored it 23-20 for <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. `` I felt <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> failed to answer the question that was asked him three times about what he would do if he had to assume the presidency,'' said <PERSON> Mancuso </PERSON>. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Southworth </PERSON>, director of forensics and professor of speech at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Redlands </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, scored it 26-24 for <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, but said, `` I thought <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> won a large majority of the issues, but I'm not convinced he will come out looking as if he did.'' He said he was not sure how viewers will take <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> crack <PERSON> Donn </PERSON> <PERSON> Parson </PERSON>, director of graduate study in the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communication </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, rated <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> a 25-20 winner. `` The difference was <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s inability to cite specifics,'' said <PERSON> Parson </PERSON>. `` One of the best examples was on the environment. He answered by saying <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will take on the problem.'' In the Sept. 25 debate between <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the AP panel picked <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as a narrow winner on points, 144-141. The judges watched the debate on television and used a scorecard modeled after the one used in collegiate and scholastic debates. They awarded one to five points in each of six categories: reasoning, evidence, organization, refutation, cross-examination and presentation. A 1 was poor; 2 fair; 3 average; 4 excellent, and 5 superior. Each judge could award a maximum of 30 points. A perfect score would have been 180. Here are the candidates' combined scores:

<TEXT>
 Governments with a stake in the oil-rich <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> should give urgent priority to the threat from mines, Western military and diplomatic officials say. Even though there is a cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war, `` the mines do n't know there's a cease-fire,'' said <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, who has commanded the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mine-sweeping contingent in the gulf for the past few months, said Monday, `` They're out there, cocked and ready to fire. If we do n't deal with them on our terms, we'll have to deal with them on theirs.'' At least seven mines have been found in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> since the truce went into effect 45 days ago, and military sources speak of a `` statistical probability'' that a ship will hit one of the explosives. American intelligence assessments say there are 150 to 200 mines still in the gulf, concentrated in the north. Most are believed to have been laid by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and some by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, officers say, but neither country has provided data on the locations. These officers have predicted that the problem will worsen as winter storms cause more of the long-submerged explosives to break loose and follow prevailing currents down the western coast of the gulf. Military sources, speaking on condition they not be identified, said the mines threaten not only shipping but the fishing industry, underwater oil pipelines and children who sometimes find the odd-looking globes washed up on beaches. Several coastal fishing dhows have been sunk or damaged by mines. One source recalled that two <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> children were killed by a mine last year, and said another was found recently in <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION>. Between 12 and 50 mines are known to have been sunk, unexploded, by local naval units off the coast between <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, one source said. `` If those are n't found and destroyed, one of them bumping against a pipeline and exploding could create an immense pollution problem,'' he said. Progress toward a coordinated effort to clear the mines is impeded by political concerns within the six-member <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the military and diplomatic sources said. The countries _ <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> _ remained nominally neutral during the war but supported <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> against non-Arab <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Now, say Western diplomats, the council states are reluctant to undertake any action that either <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> might interpret as hostile. `` As long as the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> peace talks remain stalled, nobody wants to do anything that could be seen as ` anti-anybody,' said one diplomat. The mine threat, one said, `` is n't something they're paying a lot of attention to, and they're not likely to until things start to go bang in the night.'' Although council states privately welcomed the foreign warships sent to the gulf last year to escort tankers, their presence remains a touchy political issue and the governments might not recognize the mine problem before anti-mine vessels leave the gulf, one Western source said. There now are at least 16 foreign mine sweepers in the gulf region, including six <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, three British, two Italian, two French, one Belgian, one Dutch and one or more Soviet. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officers say there are no plans for the 30-year-old, wooden-hulled American craft to leave and suggest some might remain indefinitely.

<HEAD>Farmers' Share of Food Dollar Lowest in 75 Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 New government figures show that farmers last year got the smallest portion of the food shopper's dollar since the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> began compiling such figures 75 years ago. According to revised figures by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, the `` farm value'' of the retail cost of a market basket of food sold in grocery stores in 1987 was 30 percent, down for the third straight year from 35 percent in 1984. The farmer's share of the food dollar dropped to 32 percent in 1985 and to 31 percent in 1986. Earlier <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> estimates had put those readings even lower: to 31 percent in 1985, 30 percent in 1986 and 29 percent in 1987. Department records show the farm share of each consumer food dollar averaged 46 percent in 1913, when recordkeeping began. Until the figure fell to 31 percent in 1986, the record low mark had been 32 percent in both 1932 and 1933 during the Depression. The high was more than 50 percent in World War II and for a few years thereafter. The market basket contains average quantities of domestically produced food bought in grocery stores, excluding non-alcoholic beverages, and fish and seafood. One reason for the slippage in the farm value of grocery items has been a general weakening of prices for some raw commodities. But the situation varies greatly from item to item. And it depends on how much processing is involved. `` Only a slight amount of raw milk is lost, for example, as it is handled and processed for sale in cartons to consumers,'' the report said. `` Therefore, the farm value of the retail price per half-gallon is just a little more than the price that milk producers receive per half-gallon.'' The report added: `` In contrast, nearly 2.4 pounds of live animal are needed to yield one pound of Choice beef on the meat counter. The payment the cattle producer receives for that large quantity of live animal is the gross farm value in the price of one pound of retail beef.'' With the 1987 farm value of groceries at 30 cents of each consumer food dollar, that means 70 cents went to non-farmers, the people who buy, transport, process and sell food at wholesale and retail. Each time the farmer's share declines, it means a greater `` farm-retail'' share for the others. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Parlett </PERSON>, a food economist in the agency, says the trend to a smaller share for farmers also is the result of a growing consumer preference for a greater degree of processing in food. When the farmer's share of the food dollar was 45 cents to 49 cents in the early 1950s, there was less processing. People bought raw food, took it home and cooked or preserved it. Now, <PERSON> Parlett </PERSON> said in a recent telephone interview, supermarkets display the latest in the processor's art. `` The products we have today are n't the same,'' he said. `` Microwave products are an example. We did n't have those at all a few years ago.'' Also, he said, the `` efficiencies of farmers have picked up,'' meaning that greater yields are resulting from the same acreages, more meat from the same amount of feed.

 Fears of a decade ago that city sprawl might consume farmland by the millions of acres annually have not materialized, according to a new study by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Marlow </PERSON> <PERSON> Vesterby </PERSON> and <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> estimated that urban areas grew at the rate of about 740,000 acres a year during the 1970s `` Concern continues about the survival of farms in high-growth, rural-urban fringe areas and about the adequacy of cropland for future food and fiber production,'' they said in the latest issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine. `` However, ERS calculations based on aerial photographs show that urbanization of agricultural land is not occurring as rapidly as previously thought.'' In January 1981, just before the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration left office, a report by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lands </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Study </ORGANIZATION> said new intiatives were needed to protect farmland and to ensure that the nation would have enough productive capacity. The study estimated that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was losing agricultural land at the rate of about 3 million acres a year, including about 1 million acres from the nation's cropland base. Other experts at the time questioned the study's figures as misleading. They asserted that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was in no danger of running out of cropland. The study also estimated that American farmers would have to plant between 84 million and 143 million additional acres by the year 2000 `` in order to meet anticipated domestic and foreign demands for agricultural products.''

 The Agriculture Department says farmers soon will be getting about $ 1.2 billion in cash payments for participating in the Conservation Reserve Program. <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hertz </PERSON>, executive vice president of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday the payments are rental fees for land contracts signed in the 1986, 1987 and 1988 fiscal years Under the program, farmers agree to take highly erodible cropland from production for 10 years. In return, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> helps pay for planting the land with protective grass or trees and provides annual rental payments over the 10-year contract period. The goal under the program is to take 40 million to 45 million acres of highly erodible land from crop production by 1990. More than 25.5 million acres have have been enrolled officially, and an additional 3.4 million acres were offered by farmers in a recent signup.

<HEAD>`National Security' Kept Mishaps Secret at U.S. Nuclear Plant</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 For three decades, serious mishaps at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> nuclear weapons plant were kept secret for national security reasons and in some cases not reported to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, according to federal officials who are trying to change that attitude. One senior <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official has compared the approach to safety at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, to that which led to the explosion of the shuttle Challenger on Jan. 28, 1986. And one member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> says the facility, which has been closed since August, should not be allowed to reopen until the situation improves. An <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Callicott </PERSON>, said that since the federal government began making atomic weapons in World War II, `` there has always been a mind set, a culture, that we are doing work that is important for national security and perhaps that may override any obligation toward public accountablility. `` People have historically not been sensitive to the importance of disclosing things,'' <PERSON> Callicott </PERSON> said. `` Clearly, there is a lot of information that did not make it up the chain to top management here at headquarters.'' Without a detailed review of the record, he said, it would be impossible to determine exactly what information had reached <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and what had been released to the public. Energy Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON>, since taking office in 1985, `` has given heightened attention to the area of environmental safety and health,'' and for the first time placed these issues in the hands of an assistant secretary, <PERSON> Callicott </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> facility produces plutonium and tritium, which are used in making nuclear weapons. It is run by E.I. du <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nemours </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> under contract from the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> inspector, G.C. <PERSON> Ridgely </PERSON>, wrote in a recently released August 1985 memorandum that 30 `` reactor incidents of the greatest significance'' occurred there. None, however, were as serious as the May 1986 disaster at Chernobyl in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, according to congresssional aides. One of the most serious mishaps at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> was the melting in November 1970 of a rod used to start an atomic chain reaction, causing radioactive contamination of an adjacent room. It took 900 people three months to clean up the contamination, according to the memo. `` Serious radiation exposure could have occurred because no outside alarm existed'' and an `` alarm was ignored for two hours,'' the memo said. Last Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials said the department had not been informed of the incidents, but on Monday senior department spokesman <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anson </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> said those statements were incorrect and that the incidents had been reported to the department's regional office in <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION> He said the information apparently had not been relayed to headquarters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> from the regional office. The reactors at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> were closed down after the most recent incident, in August, and had been scheduled to reopen Tuesday. But <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials assured members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last week that production would not resume until safety was assured, possibly after 30 days to 45 days. `` If they restart those things without having briefed us and without having convinced us they have solved the safety and health issues, they will be in serious trouble in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>, chairman of the Energy, Environment and Natural Resources subcommittee of the Government Affairs Committee, held hearings on the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> facility last Friday He reacted angrily Tuesday to assertions that national security considerations ever justified keeping mishaps secret at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. `` Just because they claim it is national security does n't make it national security,'' he said. `` I did n't know that the health and safety of the workers and the surrounding citizens was a national security issue.'' <PERSON> Synar </PERSON> agreed that the department had an institutional problem, but challenged assertions that <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> had changed the situation. `` They have set up a system that rewards managers in the field for keeping the lid on bad news,'' <PERSON> Synar </PERSON> said. `` I think that there are good people at the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> that want to make safety a priority,'' he said. `` That attitude starts at the top. And I have n't seen it. It is very clear that headquarters has not been supportive of that. There has not been a system set up that made the operational or field offices accountable.'' The most blistering charge last week came from <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Starostecki </PERSON>, deputy assistant secretary for safety, health and quality assurance, in a memorandum discussing the most recent incident, a small power pulse in August. `` The issue was not whether the reactor was out of control; this time it was not,'' <PERSON> Starostecki </PERSON> said in the memo, which was released at a congressional hearing. `` The more serious issue deals with an institutional problem and attitudes toward safety,'' <PERSON> Starostecki </PERSON> said. `` There are currently some managers within the department with an attitude toward production reactor safety, which on the face seems to be similar to that which existed in the space program prior to the Challenger accident,'' he said.

<HEAD>Immigration, Natural Growth Propel Population Past 245 Million</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> now has more than 245 million residents thanks to strong immigration and an increase in the natural growth of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population, the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> says. As of Jan. 1 the national population was 245,110,000, the bureau said, up from 242,825,000 a year earlier. The largest part of the increase was from natural growth _ 1.7 million people. That resulted from 3.8 million births minus 2.1 million deaths. In addition there were an estimated 600,000 immigrant arrivals, the bureau said. At 0.9 percent for the year, the overall increase is consistent with long-term trends, the agency reported. The nation's population has been growing at about 1 percent annually since about 1960. Births last year averaged 15.6 per 1,000 people, up from 15.4 in 1986 but below the 15.7 rate of 1985. While this is well above the all-time low of 14.5 recorded in 1976, there has been no consistent trend in recent years. Population experts note that the giant post World War II Baby Boom generation currently has produced many women in their prime childbearing ages, thus producing more potential mothers to raise the birth rate. Even so, the birth rate is nowhere near the high rate set in the wake of the World War II, when births climbed to a record 26.5 per 1,000 in 1947. Deaths occurred at a rate of 8.7 per 1,000 people, and have been fluctuating in the 8.5 to 8.7 range since 1977 after declining from 9.4 in 1972. There were 2.5 net immigrants per 1,000 people, including an allowance for illegal arrivals, the bureau said. That's down from 2.7 in 1986 and well below the 3.7 mark of 1980, highest since World War II. The overall growth rate was 0.7 percent last year for whites and 1.5 percent for blacks, both down substantially since 1960.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is deciding whether excluding prospective jurors because of race violates a criminal defendant's right to a jury representing a cross-section of the community. The high court ruled in 1986 that racially motivated disqualifications violate equal-protection provisions of the law. However, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Unsinn </PERSON> asked the justices Tuesday to expand on that decision by ordering a new trial for <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Teague </PERSON>, a black man convicted of armed robbery and attempted murder. An all-white jury found <PERSON> Teague </PERSON> guilty in August 1978 after a <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutor used all of his peremptory challenges _ the disqualification of potential jurors without stating a reason _ to exclude 10 blacks from the jury. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled on April 30, 1986, in a case called <PERSON> Batson </PERSON> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION>, that a defendant's right to equal protection would be violated if prosecutors disqualified potential jurors based on their race. It later held that the ruling does not apply to convicted criminals who had exhausted direct appeals in state courts prior to the announcement of the <PERSON> Batson </PERSON> decision. While the <PERSON> Batson </PERSON> ruling came too late to help <PERSON> Teague </PERSON>, his attorney argued that the exclusion of blacks also violated her client's Sixth Amendment right to a jury representing a cross-section of the community. `` Because the prosecutor took affirmative action to destroy the representative makeup of that jury, we did not get the protection that the Sixth Amendment guarantees,'' <PERSON> Unsinn </PERSON> said. Assistant Illinois Attorney General <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bindi </PERSON> argued that it is impossible to ensure a representative cross-section of the community for every trial and said the fact that <PERSON> Teague </PERSON>'s jury was all white did not necessarily deny him a fair trial. `` Cross-sectionalism is not the litmus test of impartiality,'' <PERSON> Bindi </PERSON> said. `` To equate jury impartiality with some form of mix on the jury ... is to take a dangerous step toward saying that juries be filled by quotas.'' The 7th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled in May 1987 that past <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decisions make clear the fair cross-section requirement of the Sixth Amendment does not apply to the jury itself, but only to the pool of potential jurors from which the jury is chosen. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is expected to rule on the case sometime next year.

 When <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> used 3,000 $ 1 bills to pay the county taxes on his tool-rental business, he thought his feelings were clear and the matter was closed.

 Basketball coach <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarkanian </PERSON>'s long feud with the <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> is being refereed by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in a case testing the collegiate organization's disciplinary authority. The court's decision could affect, among other things, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Collegiate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s investigations into alleged drug use by some athletes. The justices, who granted an <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> appeal last February, were to hear arguments in the case today. A decision is expected by July. <PERSON> Tarkanian </PERSON>, head coach at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nevada </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> since 1973, is trying to preserve the victory he won in lower courts and avoid a two-year suspension for alleged <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> violations. Following a 30-month investigation, <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> officials said <PERSON> Tarkanian </PERSON> arranged for a student to get a `` B'' grade without attending class, provided free air fare to a student-athlete, encouraged individuals to give the <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> false information to impede its probe, falsely certified <ORGANIZATION> UNLV </ORGANIZATION>'s program as complying with <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> rules and failed to comport with high ethical standards. The <ORGANIZATION> Nevada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled that <PERSON> Tarkanian </PERSON> was denied due-process during the <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> investigation that led to his suspension. But to reach that conclusion, the state court had to find that the <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION>, a private organization, acted with governmental power. The justices' handling of that larger issue will affect coaches and athletes at state-run <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> member schools across the nation. Individuals and private organizations generally can not violate someone's constitutional rights. Only a government and its agents can do that because the Constitution protects against governmental _ not private _ wrongdoing. Courts call the concept the `` doctrine of state action.'' The <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> is a private organization representing nearly 1,000 colleges and universities. But in the <PERSON> Tarkanian </PERSON> case, the state court said the <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> was acting as a surrogate for <ORGANIZATION> UNLV </ORGANIZATION>, a state university. `` The right to discipline public employees is traditionally the exclusive prerogative of the state,'' the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> court said. `` <ORGANIZATION> UNLV </ORGANIZATION> can not escape responsibility for disciplinary action against employees by delegating that duty to a private entity.'' Because the <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> investigators were acting as agents of a state school, the state court ruled, <PERSON> Tarkanian </PERSON> was entitled to more due process _ more opportunities to be heard and more information about the investigation. The <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION>, insisting its investigation was not `` state action,'' sought help from the nation's highest court. If the justices agree with the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> court, the <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> will find itself in a curious position. It will have to afford more due-process rights to coaches and athletes at state-run schools than those who work for or attend private schools. The <ORGANIZATION> UNLV </ORGANIZATION> program was placed on two years' probation in 1977 for recruiting violations, and the <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> that same year ordered the school to suspend <PERSON> Tarkanian </PERSON>. His court fight staved off the suspension, and won him the right to have the <ORGANIZATION> NCAA </ORGANIZATION> pay some of his legal fees.

 The power of states and local governments to require minority participation in public works projects is being explored by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in a key affirmative action dispute. The justices were to hear arguments today over a <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, program that set aside 30 percent of the value of all municipal building projects for minority participation. The court is expected to decide by July whether the plan should be reinstated. The plan was challenged successfully in a lower court by J.A. <ORGANIZATION> Croson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a building contractor. At stake could be similar set-aside plans established by most states and some 190 local governments. The case also is attracting widespread attention because of what it might foretell about the court's future approach to other forms of affirmative action and alleged reverse discrimination. Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> is participating in his first case involving preferential treatment for minorities since joining the court last February. He replaced Justice <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, who often cast the deciding vote on affirmative action issues in the closely divided court. Set-aside programs also have caused some deep divisions and seemingly contradictory views within the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, for example, said in 1984 he favored channeling billions of additional contract dollars to minority-owned firms. And the administration generally has looked upon public works set-asides more sympathetically than other affirmative action quotas it sternly opposes. But the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, responding to an invitation from the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in a case similar to the <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> dispute, challenged the constitutionality of set-asides. The <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> plan was declared unlawful in September 1987 by the 4th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. The appeals court said there is insufficient evidence that <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> city officials discriminated against minority-owned businesses in the past. Also, the appeals court said the city's 30 percent quota appeared to be a completely arbitrary figure that `` simply emerged from the mists.'' <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> adopted the plan in 1983 to require that a prime contractor on any city building project subcontract at least 30 percent of the value of the project to firms that are at least one-half minority owned. The minorities named in the plan are blacks, Hispanics, Orientals, Indians, Eskimos and Aleuts. The 4th Circuit court, in invalidating the program, relied heavily on a 1986 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that struck down an affirmative action plan in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> designed to protect from lay-offs the jobs of minority teachers with less seniority than whites. The justices in that case said preferential treatment of minorities must be narrowly tailored to avoid hurting whites. The justices also restricted the power of employers to adopt affirmative action programs when there has not been proof the employers practiced past discrimination. But civil rights groups point to a 1980 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that allows <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to earmark 10 percent of federal public works contracts for minority-controlled businesses. The court also has upheld other forms of affirmative action programs in a string of recent decisions. Minorities make up about half of <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>'s population, and minority-owned businesses received less than 1 percent of the value of city contracts prior to adoption of the set-aside. The plan was challenged by J.A. <ORGANIZATION> Croson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> after its bid _ the only one submitted to install stainless steel urinals and water closets at the city jail was rejected. City officials refused to award the contract even though <PERSON> Croson </PERSON> said there was only one minority contractor that could help on that project and <PERSON> Croson </PERSON> considered that company unqualified. <PERSON> Croson </PERSON> also said the cost of the project would rise by $ 7,663 if the minority contractor took part. The city then called for new bids.

 Two of the world's largest food distribution companies have denied charges they failed to follow international guildelines for marketing infant formula in Third World countries. Both the Swiss-based <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> responded quickly Tuesday when Action for Corporate Accountability announced it was renewing a boycott against <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION> products and extending it to <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION>. Leaders of the Minnesota-based group engineered a seven-year boycott against <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION> that ended in 1984 when the company agreed to an infant formula marketing code worked out with the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION>, an arm of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Boycott </PERSON> leaders said they were renewing their call for the marketplace action because <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> were not abiding by the agreement. `` <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION> has worked diligently to ensure its marketing policies follow WHO recommendations,'' company spokesman <PERSON> Thad </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He said the guidelines allow companies to provide free or reduced-price formula to hospitals in Third World nations for babies who `` have to be fed breast-milk substitutes.'' <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Emerling </PERSON>, a spokewoman for <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` This whole activity is based on allegations that we violate the WHO code _ and we flat out deny it. `` The real issue is infant health,'' she said. `` Breast-feeding is best for infants; we've always said that. But every infant who is not receiving breast milk has the right to the best alternative available. That alternative is a scientifically formulated infant formula that is as close to breast milk as man can make it. And that is what our infant formula products are.'' <PERSON> Boycott </PERSON> leader <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accountability </ORGANIZATION>, contended at a news conference that <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> and _ to a lesser degree _ other formula distributors are interpreting the guidelines in a way that allows them to skirt the intent and encourage mothers who could breast feed their babies to use formula instead. Although <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> does not have a blanket objection to using infant formula, he maintains it is wrong for manufacturers to encourage its use in powdered form in Third World countries where most mothers typically do n't have the money, education and sanitary facilities to mix it properly. The result, he argues, is that thousands of Third World babies develop often fatal diseases because they drink from bottles with understrength formula that either does not give them the nutrients they need or infects them with various germs, or both. The fundamental issue is whether formula distributors effectively get babies and their mothers hooked on formula within days of birth by making their product available for free distribution at hospitals and other birthing facilities. `` In the hands of the poor, the feeding-bottle often becomes a passport to death for the young child,'' said Dr. <PERSON> R.K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anand </PERSON>, a pediatrician from <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, present at the news conference. The physician said his practice has convinced him of three things: `` Bottle feeding continues to kill a large number of babies in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and other developing countries. Even poor mothers can produce enough breastmilk for their babies for at least the first four months of life.

<HEAD>Congress Fails Again To Update Clean Air Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> split by economic and regional differences has proven again that cleaning up air pollution from vehicle tailpipes and industrial smokestacks remains the nation's toughest environmental problem Only once since the Clean Air Act was enacted in 1970 has <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> been able to agree on major amendments to strengthen the basic law, and that occurred 11 years ago. Two years ago, environmentalists in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> renewed the campaign to escalate the battle against urban smog, acid rain caused by coal-burning factories and power plants and toxic fumes from chemicals. On Tuesday, they tossed in the towel, vowing to try again next year. `` There has not been sufficient willingness to compromise,'' said Sen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, who spent much of 1988 trying to put together a consensus on a clean air bill. `` As a result, we will do nothing.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, citing this summer's smog alerts around the country, said the technology exists to control air pollution. `` All we lack is the political will to do so.'' Among those he cited as resisting compromise were the environmental lobby and the two behemoths that would be most affected by such legislation: electric utilities and the auto industry, domestic and foreign. Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON>, R-Vt., a veteran of clean air wars, pointed his finger at <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, who held the <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s bill off the floor for 11 months while he pushed for concessions for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> The bill's death left the nation with no new tools to combat the ozone and carbon monoxide _ chiefly from vehicle emissions _ that has grown to the point that upwards of 100 urban areas are violating air quality standards designed to protect human health. Also left in the dust was any new plan to deal with toxic fumes from chemical plants and the acid-rain chemicals produced by coal-burning power plants and factories. Last month, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union, worked out an acid rain plan that favored <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s high sulfur coal industry and mandated the use of expensive stack gas scrubbers by about two dozen large utilities. The proposal infuriated senators from Western states with cleaner burning, low sulphur coal. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wyo </LOCATION>., threatened to filibuster The environmental lobby's <ORGANIZATION> Clean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> also criticized the plan, saying that no bill was better than a weak one. Southern lawmakers were unhappy because the proposal would have forced some of their power plants to install scrubbers to solve what is generally seen in the Capitol as a problem of <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> utilities polluting the Northeast. For its part, the utilities' lobby, the <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, consistently said `` no'' to acid rain controls. It cited scientific disagreements over the problem and said controls should await development of clean-coal technology, which is expected to be cheaper than scrubbers. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> issued a statement saying he was `` disappointed that a compromise on acid rain could not be reached this year that would both enhance the environment and protect the economies of coal-producing states like <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. ... I will continue to work to resolve this issue.'' The fight over acid rain was just part of the complicated closed-door negotiations over the clean air bill. Another major factor in its demise was a proposal to help combat urban pollution by forcing reluctant automakers to produce vehicles with cleaner exhaust emissions. A key player in this area was Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., who represents an automaking district and who chairs the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> and clean-exhaust advocate Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., were unable to agree on new tailpipe standards, thus paralyzing the committee and keeping a clean air bill off the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON> held no serious negotiations after August, taking the position that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> should solve its acid rain problems and send a clean air plan to the House. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> had even discussed a scenario under which the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would pass the basic acid rain language, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would handle the urban pollution provisions and the two bodies would accept each other's product. Matters never got to this point. <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON> said he and some other pro-environment senators could have taken the <LOCATION> Mitchell-Trumka </LOCATION> plan had <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> agreed to support the anti-smog and toxic chemicals sections. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, however, declined to make this commitment, leaving supporters of a strong bill unwilling to leave the question of stricter tailpipe emissions to chance and eventual negotiations with <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayres </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Clean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, said the environmental lobby was unwilling to support the <LOCATION> Mitchell-Trumka </LOCATION> plan because `` we ca n't recommend an acid rain program unless it is good.''

<HEAD>House Sustains Reagan Textile Veto _ Sponsors Look to Next Year</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Supporters of a bill to impose tougher restrictions on textile imports, after failing to override President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto, promise to renew their efforts when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> returns next year. `` We'll be back,'' Sen. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, said Tuesday after the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 272-152 to override <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto but fell 11 votes short of the two-thirds needed to enact the measure over his objections. The action appeared to close the book on the battle for textile legislation this year, with two weeks at most remaining before lawmakers adjourn to campaign full time. The bill, designed to protect <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> industry from foreign competition, would freeze current textile and apparel imports at 1987 levels and limit future increases to 1 percent annually. The same would apply to non-rubber footwear except that no future growth would be allowed. Countries that increase their purchases of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm goods would get larger shares of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> textiles market. A pilot program would be established, allowing the government to auction off import licenses. A special quota would be created for imported silk neckties. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> vetoed the measure Sept. 28, saying it represented `` protectionism at its worst'' and would not only narrow consumer choices but inhibit trade and cost <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> overseas sales. Sponsors said it would save American jobs now in jeopardy because of a wave of Asian textiles and apparel crowding <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> merchandise out of stores. House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, lobbied furiously for the override and sponsors said they were close to two-thirds at one point. `` But we had some guys we just could n't pull across,'' said Rep. W.G. <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.C. </LOCATION> `` Obviously, I'm disappointed,'' <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> said in a statement. He claimed the bill was similar to provisions endorsed by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> several years ago before the president became critical of `` this protectionism nonsense.'' `` The failure to override the veto means that the next <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> or the next administration must act to restructure our current inefficient textile policy,'' Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION>, said after the vote. Textile and apparel workers bused in for the occasion from various <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> cities held a flag-waving rally on the steps of the Capitol at noon, chanting, `` Save our jobs, save our jobs.'' Some then watched glumly from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> galleries as the legislation met its doom. Critics portrayed the measure as guaranteed to spur price increases that would amount to a fresh tax on consumers. `` Stand up for consumers, stand up for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, support your president's veto,'' urged Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Frenzel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Minn </LOCATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., another of the bill's fiercest critics, said `` it imposes a tax on consumers of about $ 20 billion a year Rep. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, D-Ga., sometimes said to occupy `` the textile seat'' on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, scoffed at the notion of new price hikes under the bill and added that import curbs are common in <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> countries `` They have quotas all over <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> said. Rep. <PERSON> Olympia </PERSON> <PERSON> Snowe </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Maine </LOCATION>, whose home-state shoe factories have been hammered by imports, urged lawmakers to ignore `` the ideological rot of an obsolete free-trade policy'' and approve `` this sensible trade bill.'' A number of lawmakers alluded to upcoming elections and political pressures arising from the bill. If the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> `` were to do this by secret ballot, there would be no doubt about the outcome,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Downey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION> `` To override the president's veto makes no sense. ... Open markets make us all richer.'' `` Do n't be dissuaded by those who tell you that this is a great political issue,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ill </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` Bad economics does n't make for good politics.'' Imports surged into the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market in the early 1980s, and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> responded with a textile bill that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> vetoed on similar grounds in December 1985. An override attempt failed in the House in August 1986. The textile industry, already protected by 1,400 tariffs, undertook a wave of modernization as a result and there were many layoffs as aging plants closed and new ones were automated. Earnings were up last year, and critics of the bill say the industry is flourishing. But earnings fell 12 percent in the first quarter of this year and layoffs have increased over the last 12 months.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Low Debate Expectations Could Work in Quayle's
Favor</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Call it the first one-man debate in presidential campaign history: <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> versus <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> will share the stage for tonight's vice presidential debate, but it's clearly <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s show. If the polls are right, most Americans have a positive view of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, the lanky, patrician senator from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Few doubt his qualifications to move up to the office of president, if that were required. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is quite another matter. Opinion polls say most Americans have serious doubts about the youthful <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator's qualifications to be president `` People are looking for him to get up there and stumble,'' said <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Mabry </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member from <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, one of the few Southern states the Democratic ticket still is given a fighting chance to carry in November. `` If <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> comes across as a person who could lead the country, it's going to make our job tougher,'' <PERSON> Mabry </PERSON> said. When the lights go up in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, tonight, attention will be riveted on <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. The fact that he is seen as far more likely to blunder opens a greater opportunity for him to emerge a big winner. Will he fall on his face? Will he commit some verbal gaffe that will dominate coverage of the debate? Can he survive 90 minutes in front of a national audience of millions? No such questions are asked about <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. Obviously, that's a great danger for the Democratic ticket. Perhaps <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> represents the ultimate political expectations game, a candidate who can claim victory if he avoids embarrassing himself, while his opponent goes on stage with the burden of being portrayed as Mr. Senior Senator, a man who does n't make mistakes. How will voters judge these two candidates? Will they score one gaffe by <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> as the equal of three by <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>? But the <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> debate can be much more than an expectations game. In a sense, neither candidate wants to be seen as debating the other. Each gains far more by establishing his own credentials, an easier job for <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> than for <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. But that is the factor that moves the debate beyond the surface expectations game of can Quayle survive 90 minutes without stumbling. <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> English </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, saw the debate as an opportunity for <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> to `` settle in the voters minds that he is vice presidential material. If he falls on his face _ which we certainly do not expect _ then it would go in the opposite direction.'' As for <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, Democratic pollster <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said `` I think he's looking for two words to be said about him: solid and competent. He's not debating <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. He's in essence telling you why a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> administration makes sense and why a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration does n't make sense.'' Good advice to a candidate up against an opponent who could win as long as he does n't trip over his tongue. It may be enough for <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> to come across to viewers as a credible <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> senator from <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, a man who sits across the aisle from <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, one who often is on the same side of issues as the Texan. Certainly, one expectation is that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> will try to make just that point during the debate, that he will point out his agreements with <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and the many areas of disagreement both have with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. That might do it for <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. Or it might leave the lingering question established in the minds of many voters in the weeks immediately following <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision to place the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator on the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> ticket. `` The larger and broader question about <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is left unanswered,'' said <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>. That question is how does he perform `` if you turn the keys of the free world over to him.''

<HEAD>Bush Campaign Targeting Moderate Democrats as Well as `Reagan
Democrats'</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Political Rdp Bjt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Campaign strategists for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> say they are trying to win the nation's most populous state by pursuing not only the `` Reagan Democrats'' but also more moderate Democrats who might be attracted to a `` future-oriented'' <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate distinct from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` A number of swing voters are not <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> <PERSON> Democrats </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Merksamer </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> state campaign chairman, said in reference to those Democrats who voted for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in the past two elections. `` They are more moderate Democrats,'' who are `` not necessarily in sinc'' with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s conservative ideas. With a Democratic edge in the state's voter registration, the Republicans must attract Democrats _ as they have in past elections _ to win the state with the most electoral votes _ 47. Public opinion polls show the race virtually even, making <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> a critical toss-up state. Its diverse economy and broad demographic and social makeup makes <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> an expensive state in which to campaign, but both candidates are making an all-out push. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign will devote most of its resources in the coming weeks to winning swing voters and <PERSON> Democrats </PERSON>, said senior campaign consultant <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacy </PERSON>, who is heading the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> effort. He said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> forces are confident they have already shored up their Republican support in the tight contest. In comments to reporters traveling with the campaign Tuesday, <PERSON> Lacy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Merksamer </PERSON> refused to disclose projected budget figures for the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> effort. The moderate Democrats, many of whom live in the <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> area, do not respond `` with the same emotional intensity'' to the so-called value issues that are popular with the Democrats who crossed party lines to give President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> his two general election victories, said <PERSON> Merksamer </PERSON>. The campaign believes they are more likely to be swayed by speeches like the one <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made here Tuesday in which he proposed a program to promote volunteer service by young people, he said. The proposal was aimed at showing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to be a strong leader with `` future-oriented'' ideas, <PERSON> Lacy </PERSON> said. A TV ad attacking Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for the pollution in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> under his governorship has played well in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, but the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign does not see environmental concerns as decisive in the election, said <PERSON> Merksamer </PERSON>. He said it is primarily a coastal population that sees the environment as a top issue, while voters inland are more concerned about crime, taxes, and defense both from a foreign policy perspective and an economic one since much of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s economy is driven by defense contracting. Besides the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> commercial, the campaign has been running a `` crime quiz'' commercial attacking <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, and positive ads featuring excerpts from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s lively speech at the Republican National Convention in August, and another `` feel-good'' ad narrated by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s wife <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Honduras Wants United Nations To Evict Nicaraguan Rebels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> is calling for the creation of a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> peace force to evacuate thousands of Nicaraguan rebels based in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and relocate them far from its borders. The Honduran proposal, unveiled Tuesday night by Foreign Minister <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON>, also would apply to the comparatively small number of leftist rebels from <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvador </ORGANIZATION> who operate out of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said Tuesday night he had not seen <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON>' speech and had no comment. Nonetheless, the speech appeared to signal <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>' determination to end the tacit cooperation it has been providing to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by allowing the anti-communist rebels to use <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> as a staging area for attacks against <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> Underscoring <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON>' apparent effort to disassociate <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy was his description of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, along with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, as a `` hegemonistic power.'' <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> called on <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> to oversee the creation of a peace force comprised of troops from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The force would guarantee the `` non-use'' of Honduran territory by foreign insurgents, he said, adding that the proposed unit should be authorized to use force, if necessary, to achieve its objectives. The unit should locate the combatants in Nicaraguan and <LOCATION> Salvadoran </LOCATION> territories, `` far away from Honduran borders,'' he said. `` Their relocation in third countries should be carried out from sites in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. whose governments have declared themselves neutral,'' he added. The proposal represents a revised and updated version of a plan which the Hondurans set forth in November 1987. At the time, however, there were relatively few Contras in the border era. <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, as a front-line state which shares a long border with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, has been a major pillar of American policy toward <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> for more than six years. As a deterrent to potential Nicaraguan aggression, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> maintains about 1,200 troops in the country and has carried out numerous <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military training missions there. <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> also has been a major recipient of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic aid. But <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> always has been uneasy about the presence of the U.S.-backed Contras along the border, fearing that the situation could be used by the militarily powerful Sandinista government as an excuse to invade <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. There have been numerous cross-border incidents involving the two countries. The situation in the region has changed radically since February, when the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> rejected an administration proposal for additional military aid to the Contras. Thousands of Contras have fled across the border to the <LOCATION> Honduran </LOCATION> base camps where <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign aid officials have been carrying out a large scale humanitarian assistance program. Under an agreement the Contras signed with the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> in March, the aid was to have been distributed to Contras in several designated zones inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. But that plan was never implemented, leaving many Contras no choice but to go to the border area for sustenance. <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> has watched these developments unfold with a deep sense of unease, worried about the possibility that the Contras may settle in the border area for an indefinite period. The rebels and the <LOCATION> Sadinista </LOCATION> government signed a temporary cease-fire agreement on March 23 but have been unable to agree on a lasting peace accord.

 Republican <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, with two mock debates and dozens of issues briefings behind him, says he'll `` just be myself'' when he faces Democrat <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> in tonight's nationally broadcast confrontation between the vice presidential candidates With <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s media guru, <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Ailes </PERSON>, and a host of top campaign strategists at his side, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> Tuesday night. He declined to tip his hand about debate strategy, saying only, `` tune in and find out.'' But it's no secret that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> will be on the attack against Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, not the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator, whom the Republicans portray as closer to them on the issues than to the Democrats. `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is running for president, and he's the one I'm very concerned about becoming president. It would be a very troubling notion for many Americans,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told reporters on his campaign plane en route to <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> plans a brief walk-through today of the <ORGANIZATION> Omaha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auditorium </ORGANIZATION>, scene of the debate. He sounded upbeat and appeared confident Tuesday as he chatted with reporters in the first such on-the-record session he's had on his plane. `` I'm going to just be myself,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` I will be prepared to answer any and all questions.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he sees the debate as `` an opportunity to communicate with the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public in an unedited version.'' `` They'll be able to see <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as I really am,'' he said. `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people do n't know me. They have a lot of questions ... They do n't have any details of who <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is.'' Asked in what areas he was anticipating attacks from <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> replied, `` Everywhere.'' Aides to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> were effusive Tuesday in their public expressions of confidence in the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator, and denied that they had tried to boost his odds going into the confrontation by lowering expectations for his performance. `` We are very, very proud of you. We are very, very proud of the job you are doing for this campaign, and we are very, very proud of the job we know you're going to do ... in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said at a rally at campaign headquarters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> D.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s tenure as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate has been marked by intense media scrutiny and controveries over his academic record, military service and personal life. He has also committed a number of gaffes and malapropisms during the campaign. <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> strategists have said that because <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has been portrayed as a caricature and lightweight candidate he should benefit from the low expectations for his performance. In essence, they suggest, anything short of a major blunder will allow him to come away looking good. But <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign manager, said, `` We have n't done anything at all about lowering expectations. `` I think he'll do fine on all the issues,'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has had two 90-minute mock debates, Saturday and Monday night, with Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>, R-Ore., who played <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> during the debate preparation His aides have been conducting briefings along with question-and-answer sessions since last week. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Prosperi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s spokesman, said much of the area they had focused on involved attacks that were anticipated from <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. Polls have indicated that voters have doubts about <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s qualifications, but <PERSON> Prosperi </PERSON> resisted suggestions that tonight's debate could have a critical effect on the `` This is only part of the campaign. There's a continuous debate every day and there will be until Nov. 8,'' he said. `` The debate will be an important part of it, but it's not the end-all.''

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> returned home to catch up on gubernatorial duties after courting crucial voters in the industrial <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> with a promise of a White House that cares about the plight of struggling families. `` I care about working people and working families and that's the difference between <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Democrats and Republicans,'' the Democratic presidential nominee told a rally Tuesday afternoon in <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> `` We care.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION> to tour its Jeep assembly plant, where he received a warm welcome from its union workers. Earlier he addressed students and faculty at <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, and he ended his campaign day by attending two private receptions in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, with <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> luminaries. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was spending most of today at the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION> and was scheduled to meet with reporters this afternoon. He also was attending a rally with supporters after tonight's vice presidential debate between Democrat <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and Republican <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. Because of the focus on the space shuttle mission and the vice presidential debate, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> offered no new proposals this week but sought to bring together his initiatives under the umbrella issue of restoring <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dominance in the world marketplace. He also underscored the theme of his campaign's largest advertising effort _ a four-ad series portraying <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as a product of media handlers who has presented no viable solutions to the nation's problems. `` He offers slogans and symbols; we offer solutions,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` This nation did n't become the greatest on earth because we were satisfied with the status quo.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also repeatedly likened this year's race to the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy-Nixon </ORGANIZATION> contest of 1960, at one point comparing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s tactics to those of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> in the race 28 years ago `` They said the same thing about <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> in 1960 _ all that gloom and doom,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` And what was he saying? ` We can do better.''' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides, while conceding they still trail <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, have said privately in the past two days that some of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s support appears to be waning and that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> hopes to attract the growing number of undecided voters in the campaign's final five weeks. `` The stakes are very high and the race is geting even closer,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told his <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> audience. In the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> speech, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> delivered a sharply worded attack on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and said his rival was running from `` a record of failure and walking away from every major challenge he has faced.'' He told the college audience that he and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> would restore <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s leadership in the world economy through innovative business and labor partnerships at home and a tough trade stance abroad. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was trying to pin the `` gloom and doom'' label on Democrats because he had no answers to the trade and budget deficits and the decline of research and development in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` Cite these facts and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will tell you that you're downgrading <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the same thing <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> did in 1960 when <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was telling us to look to a new frontier,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said `` My friends, if we disregard these facts we endanger <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' He also boasted: `` I'm running for president on my record. Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is running away from his _ a record of failure and walking away from every major challenge he has faced.'' There were no new proposals in the speech. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> repeated his familiar call for business-labor partnerships, tough enforcement of the new trade law, reduction of the trade and budget deficits and `` some reasonable limits on the merger and acquisition binge that continues to sweep this country.''

 <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> announced Tuesday it had negotiated a sale of its assets for $ 115 million to a Canadian businessman, a month after <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> failed in his efforts to return to the helm of his television ministry. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, will pay $ 50 million at closing under terms of the deal and pay the balance over five years, according to a statement handed out prior to a news conference by a Mernick spokesman. <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> has interests in real estate, clothing, garbage collection and landfills, the statement said. <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> has been under the supervision of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Court Judge <PERSON> Rufus </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, who told <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> trustee M.L. `` Red'' <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> that a buyer must be found by Oct. 14 or he would order the assets sold to pay creditors. The ministry is estimated to owe more than $ 130 million. <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> was not at Tuesday's news conference. An Orthodox Jew, he was in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> and did n't travel to <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> because Tuesday was the Jewish holiday of Simhat Torah. `` His primary interest as a businessman is to get the maximum return on his investment,'' <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kluttz </PERSON> said at a news conference. <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s property, mostly in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, includes a television studio, a hotel and shopping center, a campground, amusement park and a church. Private housing also has been developed on the property. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, who resigned as head of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> last year after admitting to adultery, made a $ 172 million offer last month for the ministry but could n't raise the money. `` <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> and I remain committed to the restoration of the ministry of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said in a statement through his attorney. `` If the present offer is agreeable to the creditors, the partners and the court, and God's will is satisfied with the respect to the ministry of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>, we will be happy with that outcome.'' <PERSON> Kluttz </PERSON> said the contract was signed with <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> on Monday after about three weeks of negotiations. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> also did not attend the news conference. But <PERSON> Kluttz </PERSON> distributed a statement from <LOCATION> Benton </LOCATION> saying he would recommend approval of the bid to <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> later this week. <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s religious functions have been separated from its other operations, and <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> is leasing back its facilities from <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> to continue on-site worship and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> TV show production. In a Sept. 15 letter to <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> wrote: `` While I am not a Christian, I have a great deal of respect for the depth of the religious feeling of the many thousands of Christians that have supported the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> over the years.'' <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> cautioned that he could not commit himself on the ultimate disposition of the property, but left the door open to keeping at least some of the property as a religious park. <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code in June 1987. Three months earlier, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> quit the ministry after admitting he had a sexual encounter with church secretary <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>. Charges of mismanagement and grossly inflated salaries for the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> and top aides resulted in an <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> investigation of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> and a lawsuit by the ministry to recover $ 52 million from the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> and their chief assistant. <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s trustee also considered a bid for $ 113 million from <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> real estate executive <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said last week that another group of investors from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> also were interested in the property. A hearing on Oct. 17, at which the judge is expected to hear arguments from creditors seeking liquidation of the assets, has been set in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. At <LOCATION> Heritage </LOCATION> <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> complex in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mill </LOCATION>, staff members said they knew little about the new owner or his plans but were relieved a deal had been struck. `` Most of the staff here right now, his name is just being filtered down. Until more information is disseminated through the news media, I think the initial reaction from the staff is going to be ` Who?''' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Knode </PERSON>, retail director for <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>. `` But I think there's going to be a real sigh of relief that everything has come to a conclusion. All of us have been through the wringer, and we're glad the ringer has stopped.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is fighting in court for the rights of governors to veto federally issued training assignments for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, a position that a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney said was a `` dagger aimed at the heart of national defense.'' In a hearing Tuesday in federal appeals court, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON> argued that governors have a right under the `` militia clause'' of the Constitution to veto National Guard training assignments. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s civil division, said `` this is a political case'' and warned that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, might regret a victory if elected president. `` The view from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is very different from the view from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON> said. If each of the 50 governors were allowed to opt out of controversial training assignments, he said, `` you end up with potential chaos.'' <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON> said the state's position amounted to `` a dagger aimed at the heart of national defense.'' The issue began when federal authorities ordered 13 public relations specialists from the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> to train in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in May and June. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> withheld his consent and filed suit on Jan. 29 seeking to block the mission. However, the court upheld the authority of federal officials on May 6 on the grounds that <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> troops are sworn to federal duty as well as state duty. The mission was carried out. The three-judge panel of the 1st U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> said it would review the arguments. Lawyers said it could take months to issue a ruling. Afterward, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' Statehouse press secretary, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was trying to uphold a principle endorsed by many governors of both parties. `` There is a very important principle at stake here _ a 200-year tradition of the states being responsible for the training of the militia,'' <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON> said. Asked if the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign was concerned that the governor's position could be used against him in the presidential campaign to portray <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as `` soft'' on defense, <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON> shot back: `` Who's going to make that argument, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> He was referring to Republican vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who came under criticism for seeking a position in the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> during the Vietnam War, a status that spared him from combat duty. <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON> warned that if <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> prevailed, it would `` permit governors to interfere in sensitive foreign policy decisions.'' Specifically, he said, the Constitution gave <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> the power to enact the 1986 Montgomery Amendment, which prohibited governors from objecting to <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> assignments in peacetime unless their states were facing an emergency such as a flood. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> case is paralleled by a similar challenge filed by <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON>, which was also rejected at the district court level. The <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> case also is on appeal.

<HEAD>House Offers Limited Civil Rights for Its Employees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The House for the first time is offering its employees limited civil rights protection by establishing a procedure for workers to contest sexual harassment or discrimination. Supporters called the resolution, which was approved Tuesday on a 408-12 vote, a first step toward ending the legislative hypocrisy for which critics fault <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ passing laws to protect all workers in the nation except its own. `` Discrimination is just as wrong in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as it is anywhere else,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, D-Calif. Rep. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, predicted <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would go further in future years to extend to its workers the protections offered in fair labor standards laws and by the Occupational Safety and Health Act The legislation covers only the 12,000 or so employees of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, so it takes effect without further action by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> or the president. And because it is a resolution, not a change in the law, it will have to be re-enacted next year to continue in force. Lawmakers voting against the measure were Reps. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ala </LOCATION>., <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stump </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>., <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammerschmidt </PERSON>, R-Ark., <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Badham </PERSON>, R-Calif., <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Pashayan </PERSON>, R-Calif., <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>, R-Ky., <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Marlenee </PERSON>, R-Mont., <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaydos </PERSON>, D-Pa., <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanjorski </PERSON>, D-Pa., <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLay </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mollohan </PERSON>, D-W. Va.. Not voting were Reps. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, R-Calif., <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Fla </LOCATION>., <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Grandy </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON>, D-Mass., <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Marcy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaptur </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION> The change, based on the Civil Rights Act of 1964, sets up a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Office of Fair Employment Practices to handle discrimination complaints. Court interpretations of the law extend its protection also to sexual harassment cases. The office will investigate discrimination charges and is empowered to mediate cases, determine whether the charges are true and specify remedies, including job reinstatement or promotion, back pay and monetary compensation. Reprisals against employees who complain to the office are prohibited. Among cases this year that gave impetus to the move: _ Rep <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Konnyu </PERSON>, R-Calif., got into political hot water after reports that he made offensive comments to female staffers regarding their physiques In one case, he suggested that a woman in his office wear high heels instead of flat shoes and instructed her to turn around so he could see how she looked. <PERSON> Konnyu </PERSON> was defeated in this year's GOP primary. _ <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON>, the top aide to Rep. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>, D-Md., committed suicide by leaping from a 24th-floor hotel room in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> after <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported unorthodox social demands he made of male aides in <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>'s _ Rep <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON>, D-Calif., came in for criticism following reports that he made sexually explicit comments to female aides and in some cases embraced them so he would `` feel better. <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON> noted that the House has resisted being placed under regular workplace laws because it would put the executive branch in the position of enforcing laws on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which lawmakers see as an infringement on the constitutional separation of powers. <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON> said the new rules will let the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> police itself. The new House procedure would permit lawmakers to continue to discriminate among employees on the bases of geographical and political preference, so they can choose workers from their home districts and of their own parties.

 The Iraqi foreign minister complained of Iranian searches of shipping on the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and insisted that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s outlet to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> be cleared for navigation before the latest peace talks progress. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> met with <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> on Tuesday and then spoke to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. Afterward, he told reporters, `` We had a very constructive exchange of views about the course of the negotiations, and he -LRB- <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> -RRB- is going to see my Iranian counterpart.'' <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> renewed peace talks Saturday at <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> after a session in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> from Aug. 25 to Sept. 13. The talks followed a cease-fire Aug. 20 in the 8-year-old war, which left at least 1 million killed or wounded. The statements made by both delegations during the weekend and by <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> on Tuesday gave no indication of substantial progress on major issues. When asked Tuesday if <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> had introduced new proposals to break the deadlock, <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> answered: `` We are discussing all possible ideas, you see, on how to make further progress, and the discussions went well with his excellency'' the secretary-general. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> has reportedly suggested that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> agree to postpone discussion of the <LOCATION> Shatt-al-Arab </LOCATION> waterway, its outlet to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, until later in the talks, and that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> stop searching neutral ships in the gulf. The two belligerents would then proceed to deal with exchange of prisoners of war and withdrawal of troops. <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> told delegates to the 43rd <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> `` accepted the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s peace proposal -RRB- resolution only because of a crushing military defeat. `` This suspicious position on the part of the Iranian delegation was followed by its insistence on provisions which impose a de facto arms embargo on <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> at sea,'' said <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON>. He was referring to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s searches of neutral ships in the gulf. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> insists the Shatt-al-Arab waterway forming the southern border between the two nations must be cleared of sunken ships and silt accumulated during the war. `` <PERSON> Shatt-al-Arab </PERSON> is <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s only outlet to the high seas,'' <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> said Tuesday. He said navigation there must be addressed for `` the peace to be durable, comprehensive and just.'' But <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> denied he was setting a precondition for peace talks, calling such an interpretation `` a pure lie and deception.'' <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> also says <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s policy of searching neutral ships in the gulf for war cargo bound for <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> violates the cease-fire, which calls for ending all military activity. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> says it has the right as a nation at war to search ships for war material bound for its enemy. It says the issue of navigation on the Shatt-al-Arab should not be included in peace talks. <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON>'s speech was moved up at his request from its scheduled time Friday to Tuesday evening so he could leave for <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> early. <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> did not explain his premature departure. On Saturday, <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> met with Iranian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> for direct talks, but the session soon shifted to indirect talks. The secretary-general and his special mediator, Swedish U.N.

 The people who engineered a seven-year boycott against the <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION> company to fight the promotion of infant formula in Third World nations called on Tuesday for a renewal of the protest on an even larger scale. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, chairman of Action for Corporate Accountability, called for a resumption of the boycott at a news conference, arguing that <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION> has failed to live up to the agreements it signed in 1984 that ended the original action. This time, said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, the group is expanding the boycott to <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION>, which it said is the second largest distributor of infant formula in developing nations. While urging an across-the-board boycott of the two companies' products, protest leaders are asking their followers to focus on two products from each company: <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION>'s Taster' Choice Instant Coffee and Carnation Coffee-mate Non-Diary <PERSON> Creamer </PERSON>, and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION>' Anacin and Advil across-the-counter pain relievers Action for Corporate Accountability accused both companies of violating at least the spirit _ and by <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s interpretation, also the letter _ of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION> Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes. The code _ which <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION> agreed to as a condition of ending the earlier protest _ permits donations or sales of formula for distribution to infants needing breast milk substitutes, and says the formula may not be used for sales promotion. At issue is whether the formula distributors effectively cause the babies to become hooked on formula within days of birth by making their product available for free at hospitals and other facilities. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s group, based in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, says it is immoral for manufacturers to encourage the formula's use in powdered form in Third World countries where most mothers do n't have the money, education or sanitary facilities to mix it properly. The group says that thousands of Third World babies drink from bottles filled with drastically understrength formula that does not give them the nutrients they need or infects them with germs. <PERSON> Boycott </PERSON> leaders said the companies' actions have undercut the premise that mothers' milk is best, especially for Third World babies. Representatives of both firms denied the assertion. Illness often occurs when the mothers take their babies home, Dr. <PERSON> R.K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anand </PERSON>, a pediatrician from <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, said at the news conference. `` In the hands of the poor, the feeding bottle often becomes a passport to death for the young child,'' said <PERSON> Anand </PERSON>. The physician said that bottle feeding kills large numbers of babies in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and other developing countries. `` Even poor mothers can produce enough breastmilk for their babies for at least the first four months of life,'' he said. `` Restraining on the aggressive marketing of infant formula is essential. <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Mantell </PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accountability </ORGANIZATION>, estimated that about $ 6 billion in infant formula is sold worldwide each year, half of it in developing countries. She said <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION> has 40 percent to 50 percent of that $ 3 billion market and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> about 20 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION>, which is based in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, and the New York-based <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> are huge conglomerates with extensive holdings and product lines. <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION>'s better known products, besides candy, include <PERSON> Libby </PERSON>'s canned vegetables and juices, Lean Cuisine diet food and the <ORGANIZATION> Stouffer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which has more than two dozen hotels and resorts in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> sells Today Condoms, Preparation H, Dristan and dozens of over-the-counter drugs, and food products ranging from Chef <PERSON> Boyardee </PERSON> <PERSON> Pizzas </PERSON> to Jiffy Pop Popcorn. A <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Thad </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, insisted that the company is in `` total compliance'' with national and international codes. He also denied that the company is dumping infant formula in foreign hospitals and said it never gives the product directly to mothers. `` We do not dump supplies in hospitals,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` We only supply materials at their request, and in appropriate amounts.'' He said if the supplies requested by the hospitals for distribution seems `` excessive then we contact the hospital.'' <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Emerling </PERSON>, a spokewoman for <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` This whole activity is based on allegations that we violate the WHO code _ and we flat out deny it.'' Ms. <PERSON> Emerling </PERSON> said the company believes that breast-feeding is best for infants. `` But every infant who is not receiving breast milk has the right to the best alternative available. That alternative is a scientifically formulated infant formula that is as close to breast milk as man can make it. And that is what our infant formula products are.''

 Some patrons at the Russian Tea Room got lunch on the house after a construction site problem forced evacuations from the posh restaurant and nearby buildings, including Carnegie Hall.

<HEAD>State Governments Healthy Now, Vulnerable to Future Problems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 State governments are vulnerable to new financial strains in 1989, despite their success this year in maintaining services without major tax increases, according to a study by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. In its biannual survey, the governors said a drop next year in federal aid could trigger economic problems for states, since their budget surpluses are narrowing. `` These balances, if they hold as projected, are already at their lowest point in the 12 years we have been producing the survey,'' said <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheppach </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> NGA </ORGANIZATION>'s executive director. The survey released Tuesday showed revenue collections exceeded expenditures in all three fiscal years studied. But the states are reporting steady growth in spending: up 6.3 percent in fiscal 1987, 6 percent the following year and an estimated 6.8 percent in fiscal 1989. In the 1988 legislative session, 27 states passed tax laws, but most involved minor changes to conform with the new federal tax structure. The new tax laws were expected to yield less than an additional $ 1 billion, with most of the money generated by motor vehicle fuel tax increases. In general, state economies seem to be growing. While the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> and Far West continue to enjoy solid growth, most states elsewhere that were hurt by poor farm performances and a downturn in energy prices seem to be making significant economic and budgetary improvements. Here is an overview of the regions: _ <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>: The region enjoys the lowest unemployment rate and highest personal income growth in the country The positive economic signs are manifested in the highest percentage increase in state expenditures projected for fiscal 1989. _ <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION>: Unemployment rates are lower than the national average and increases in personal income are 1 percent higher than the national average General fund expenditures are slightly higher than the aggregate figure for all states. _ Great Lakes: The region's unemployment rate is higher than the national average In addition, the expected fiscal 1989 expenditures show the lowest growth rate in the country. _ The Plains: These states have made a recovery from the economic and budgetary doldrums of a few years ago Since the March governors' association survey, the unemployment rate dropped dramatically from 5.5 percent to 4.2 percent. But the annual growth in personal income also declined in the same period. The growth in expenditures is slightly above the national average, with the exception of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. _ Southeast: Unemployment has declined and personal income has risen since the March survey But the fiscally troubled states of <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> make an analysis of the region's economy difficult. _ Southwest: This region has the highest unemployment rate and the second lowest percentage increase in personal income, in part because of the oil bust in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the state that dominates the area _ <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> states: This area struggles to improve its economic and fiscal health Personal income growth is the lowest in the nation, while unemployment is slightly above the national average. _ Far West: Growth here continues strong, with personal income increasing at an average of 6.7 percent annually, led by <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> with a rise of 8.9 percent and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> at 7.2 percent Unemployment is very close to the national average.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants to tone down his attacks on Democratic presidential rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, a top aide contends, but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> continues to sprinkle speeches with a hefty dose of opponent bashing. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief of staff, <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, told reporters on Tuesday that the Republican presidential candidate wanted to get away from the appearance of waging a negative rather than issue-oriented campaign. `` He was uncomfortable with a perception forming that his is a campaign that was not talking about issues as much, because he has been talking about issues,'' said <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>. He cited <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s first campaign stop Tuesday as evidence of the new approach. In a speech to the business-oriented <ORGANIZATION> Comstock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made barely a passing reference to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. He proposed a $ 100 million program to encourage community volunteer service by young people. A new foundation, chaired by the president, would work with existing volunteer programs and act as a clearinghouse to help get more youths involved in community service. Today's campaigning in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> included remarks on a companion topic _ what society can do for children and education. But after Tuesday's speech calling for a Youth Engaged in Service to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> program of voluntary charitable activity, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> went back to some familiar <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> one-liners. The barbs he delivered in his stump speech to a rowdy rally on the steps of the <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> courthouse lacked a bit of the sting that has characterized similar recent speeches. But he unveiled a new one-liner commenting on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' proposal to reduce the deficit by beefing up <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> collection of unpaid taxes. `` Politicians used to promise a chicken in every pot,'' he said. `` He promises a tax agent in every kitchen.'' By the time he got to a late-afternoon rally in <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was revved up for attack. Referring derisively to his opponent as `` the liberal governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` I love calling him that. I love it.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` does n't even dare use the big ` L' word'' anymore. He trotted out his environmental attack on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, ridiculing the Democrat for making an environmental pitch in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> when he was the governor `` who wanted to dump the crud from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>'' in a waste site offshore from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> laced the negative comments into a speech in which he portrayed himself as an environmentalist, `` in the mold of <LOCATION> Teddy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Roosevelt </LOCATION>,'' and a man concerned about education and crime and one who wants to build a more caring nation. He noted <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had proclaimed himself tough on crime. `` If you believe that, he's got some bottled water from the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> to sell you,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in one of his favorite references to the severe pollution in the governor's homestate harbor. But <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> maintained this week's agenda would be devoted to more positive issue-based speeches. `` He would like his campaign to talk about issues ... and not be caught up in an attack on his opponent,'' he said. That does not mean that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is going soft on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, forecasting `` future speeches that draw sharp contrasts between the two candidates.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today was visiting <ORGANIZATION> Arapahoe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> where the intinerary included a tour of the science lab and remarks at an assembly where National Merit Scholarship finalists will be recognized. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> then was holding a rally at the 16th Street Mall before heading off for a campaign stop in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed intelligence authorizations in 1984 and 1985 giving <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agents broad anti-terrorism powers that some administration officials saw as `` a license to kill,'' according to a published report. The authorizations `` deemed'' as lawful any covert actions _ including potentially violent ones _ taken in `` good faith'' by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence agents against terrorists, according to a report in Wednesday's editions of The Washington Post. The language of the findings seemingly was ambiguous, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. Actions taken in good faith and as part of an approved operation would be deemed lawful in advance, but also they `` must be'' lawful, sources told the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. The newspaper quoted a former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> official, whom it did not identify, as saying the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> orders were a `` go-anywhere, do-anything'' authority. The language of the findings caused disputes among administration officials, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said, because actions that could be authorized under the findings might conflict with earlier presidential executive orders banning any direct or indirect involvement of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence agents in assassinations. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> quoted a source as saying the language was specifically designed to `` circumvent the assassination ban'' and protect <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agents who might take part in foreign strike teams. White House spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> he knew nothing about the findings late Tuesday night. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported that unidentified White House officials said Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would have been given a copy of or would have had access to the findings. A <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokesman and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, who was White House chief of staff at the time <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed the 1984 finding, had no comment, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed the first finding on Nov. 13, 1984, shortly after his landslide reelection victory, the report said, because <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials had become frustrated with car-bombings at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> facilities and the taking of American hostages. Congressional intelligence committees were not informed of the crucial language in the findings, the report said. The authorization was rescinded on April 10, 1985, a month after a car bomb exploded, killing 80 people in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> near the residence of a leader of one faction of Iranian fundamentalists. The second authorization which included similar language was signed by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Aug. 11, 1985, two months after the highjacking of <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> Flight 847 in which <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Steedham </PERSON> was killed. The intelligence panels were briefed after the signing of the second finding, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> withdrew a peace proposal to leftist guerrillas because of a wave of rebel attacks, and the army has been ordered to attack the insurgents, a cabinet minister said. `` It is incomprehensible that the answer by subversive groups to a generous peace proposal would be so violent and criminal,'' the minister of government, <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON> <PERSON> Trujillo </PERSON>, said in a broadcast interview Tuesday. <PERSON> Trujillo </PERSON> is in charge of internal security in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. Last month the president offered a cease-fire, negotiations, pardons to guerrillas who surrendered and a chance for rebel leaders to speak before congress. All six of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s leftist guerrilla groups rejected the plan, calling it an ultimatum for surrender. <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON> was particularly critical of the country's largest guerrilla group, the <ORGANIZATION> Colombian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, known by its Spanish acronym as the <ORGANIZATION> FARC </ORGANIZATION>. Sunday and Monday <ORGANIZATION> FARC </ORGANIZATION> attacks killed 12 soldiers, six policemen and three civilians, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. `` The government authorizes full institutional support for the armed forces to confront the guerrillas, because weakness or complacency does n't result in peace,'' <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON> said in an interview with the <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> radio station <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION>. Minister of Justice <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Plazas </PERSON> said the guerrillas' answer to `` the olive branch offered by President <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> has been attacks on the army, blowing up of pipelines and setting off bombs.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FARC </ORGANIZATION> has used a cease-fire during the last four years `` to cheat the government'' by building up its strength, Plazas said in a broadcast interview with the <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> radio station <ORGANIZATION> RCN </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FARC </ORGANIZATION> signed a truce with the government of President <PERSON> Belisario </PERSON> <PERSON> Betancur </PERSON> four years ago. There has been sporadic fighting between the <ORGANIZATION> FARC </ORGANIZATION> and government security forces during the truce. Another guerrilla group, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, has blown up the country's main oil pipeline 85 times in the last two years. Last Saturday the guerrilla group blew up the pipeline, which carries 225,000 barrels of oil a day from the <ORGANIZATION> Canon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Limon </ORGANIZATION> field in the northeast state of <LOCATION> Arauca </LOCATION>. Last Wednesday the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> set off a bomb in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> as the car of a <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> executive was passing by.

<HEAD>Researchers Hope To Use AZT in Pregnant Women Infected With AIDS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Pregnant women infected with the deadly AIDS virus would be treated with the drug AZT in an attempt to protect their unborn children if an experiment being planned by researchers gets the go-ahead from review boards. `` The reason we think -LRB- prevention of infection of the fetus -RRB- might be possible is that AZT prevents the replication of the virus,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoth </PERSON>, director of the AIDS program at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allergy </ORGANIZATION> and Infectious Diseases. `` It's theoretically possible that the AZT, if it reaches the fetus, might prevent it from establishing an infection,'' he said, referring to the drug formally known as azidothymidine. <PERSON> Hoth </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Tuesday night that the studies are still at least several months away, as a formal proposal has not yet been completed, and the proposal would have to pass numerous hurdles in the form of review boards concerned with the safety of such tests. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Randall </PERSON>, the institute's spokeswoman, went even further, saying the likelihood of an early start to such a study is `` still pretty tenuous.'' `` There's a lot of steps between now and the beginning of a study with pregnant women,'' she said. As of Sept. 26, AIDS had been diagnosed in 74,447 Americans, of whom 1,185 were children under age 13, and 924 of those children were infected at birth, according to the federal <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. Of the 41,925 deaths among AIDS patients, 672 have been children, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> reported. `` Most new infections of children with AIDS are related to an infected mother,'' <PERSON> Hoth </PERSON> said. Among the still unanswered questions are exactly how the child gets infected, he said. `` The virus might be transmitted in utero, that is, across the placenta,'' <PERSON> Hoth </PERSON> said. `` The second possibility is it might be transmitted at the time of childbirth through some blood-borne transmission. The third possibility is that the child becomes infected through close association with the mother after birth, such as through breast-feeding, although that remains totally speculative, totally unproven.'' However, he said, `` It's the widespread opinion of most experts in the field that one of the most important ways to stop the infection in children is to prevent the infection by catching it as early as possible. That leads you to the necessity of treating the infected mother.'' The proposal will call for studies on only a few dozen women who would be in their third trimester of pregnancy to limit the possibility of birth defects, he said. `` These are mothers that may be infected with the virus, but may not have symptoms of AIDS,'' he said. Animal model studies using mice have shown that AZT _ the only drug approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> for AIDS patients _ prevents the transmission of viral infection from an infected mother to the offspring, he said, adding that he believed there were no birth defects in those studies. However, he noted that those tests did not involve the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, that causes AIDS, but a closely related retrovirus. The side-effects of AZT encountered by some people taking the drug include a decrease in production of red or white blood cells, and such problems are a major concern for the researchers, he said. `` That's the whole question here,'' <PERSON> Hoth </PERSON> said. `` Will it be safe? What is the risk-benefit ratio? So we're proceeding cautiously. There will be consultation with many experts. We have obstetricians on our team, pediatricians. We'll be talking with other experts, including ethicists, on this issue.'' The institutional review boards that would have to approve the studies once the protocol is completed `` are charged with the protection of human subjects in clinical trials, so they must review the protocol with an eye toward the risk-benefit for both the mother and the child,'' <PERSON> Hoth </PERSON> said. `` Before we send it for review, we want to have consensus among all of the experts.'' AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a contagious disease that attacks the body's immune system, rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases and infections. The virus most often is spread through close contact with blood, blood products or semen from infected persons. No one is known to have recovered from AIDS, whose chief victims have been homosexual men and intravenous drug users.

 The House has approved and sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> a bill strengthening protection for whistelblowers who expose federal waste and mismanagement. The measure was approved Tuesday on a 418-0 vote. Sponsors said the bill was needed because the Office of Special Counsel, established to represent the interests of whistleblowers, was not doing its job. The bill is designed to reverse decisions of courts and the <ORGANIZATION> Merit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> _ a federal judicial agency _ that made it difficult for whistleblowers to win their cases. The legislation would define clearly the Office of Special Counsel's role as one of protecting whistleblowers. In some cases, the counsel has proceeded against whistleblowers who came to the office for help. The measure would make the Office of Special Counsel an independent agency. It currently is part of the <ORGANIZATION> Merit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> _ a quasi-judicial body that hears employees' appeals The bill also would: _ Alter the burden of proof in reprisal cases against whistleblowers The employee would have to show only that the agency's knowledge of the whistleblowing was a factor in his or her punishment, rather than a `` significant'' or `` dominant'' factor as required under current law. _ Require an agency to demonstrate `` with clear and convincing evidence'' that whistleblowing was not a material factor in the personnel action Currently the courts require a `` preponderance of evidence,'' an easier standard for government agencies. _ Expand the definition of prohibited personnel practices to include reprisals against workers who cooperate with inspectors general or the special counsel, those who testify in government proceedings, and those who refuse to obey an order that violates the law _ Allow individuals facing reprisals to appeal their cases directly to the merit board

 Singer-actress <PERSON> Cher </PERSON>'s boyfriend will face a misdemeanor charge of reckless driving rather than the felony assault count he originally faced in a camera-smashing incident with a photographer, publicists said. <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Camilletti </PERSON>, 24, was arrested June 27 and booked for investigation of felony assault with a deadly weapon after a confrontation with Star tabloid photographer <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON> outside the <LOCATION> Benedict </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION> home that <PERSON> Camilletti </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cher </PERSON> share.

The release said the city attorney's office concluded that <PERSON> Camilletti </PERSON> had not intended to run down the photographer. `` With this decision not to file any felony charges, I am now hopeful that <PERSON> Cher </PERSON> and I can get back to some degree of normalcy with our lives,'' he said. The city attorney could not immediately be reached for comment by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> as there was no answer at the office Tuesday evening. An attorney for <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON> also was out of the office. At the time, <PERSON> Cher </PERSON> and <PERSON> Camilletti </PERSON>, who is launching his own acting career, said the crash was the result of weeks of frustration with photographers they said were harassing them. <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON> filed a lawsuit against <PERSON> Cher </PERSON> and <PERSON> Camilletti </PERSON>, seeking unspecified damages.

 Guerrillas battled government troops at least seven times during recent days in new truce violations, and 16 rebels were killed, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> reported. Meanwhile, military sources speaking on condition of anonymity said two relatives of President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> were wounded when rebels ambushed a civilian vehicle Tuesday in Chontales province. Government officials did not confirm the report. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> statement released Tuesday night did not say if there were any government casualties in the clashes. It said rebels attacked Monday in speedboats with 60-mm mortars at a government border post 125 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. The post at <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charro </LOCATION> is on the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fonseca </LOCATION>, which is shared by <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> coast. The Ministry said the other clashes occurred Saturday through Monday in northern <LOCATION> Jinotega </LOCATION> and southeastern Zelaya Sur provinces. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> sources said rebels wounded <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s relatives when they ambushed a civilian vehicle Tuesday morning in central Chontales province. They identified the two relatives as <PERSON> Irma </PERSON> <PERSON> Mongrio </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mongrio </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON> suffered a bullet wound in a leg, the sources said. The extent of <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s injuries was not known. Their exact relationship to the president could not be determined. The temporary truce between the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government and U.S.-supported rebels has been in effect on March 21. Each side has accused the other of frequent violations, and negotiations aimed at a permanent cease-fire to the 7-year-old civil war broke down in June. The opposition newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday that three activists with the <ORGANIZATION> Confederation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION> were assassinated Sunday by gunmen in military uniforms in <LOCATION> Leon </LOCATION>, 45 miles west of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>.

 A simple urine test that detects bladder cancer at a treatable stage may be used to help diagnose prostate and some of the other cancers that afflict nearly a million Americans annually, researchers say. The test detects a protein associated with the spread of tumors, said Dr. <PERSON> Raouf </PERSON> <PERSON> Guirguis </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. The protein also has been found in patients with kidney cancer, prostate cancer and a nervous system cancer called neuroblastoma. `` It seems to be in all the cancers we have screened,'' <PERSON> Guirguis </PERSON> said. Existing tests to diagnose bladder cancer, involving removal of tissue, pose risk, are often painful and sometimes do not detect the cancer until it has spread and can no longer be cured, the cancer institute said. But <PERSON> Guirguis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Schiffman </PERSON> and colleagues, whose study is published in today's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said their test can identify bladder cancer at an early, treatable stage. They said they do not yet know whether the test will identify cancers other than bladder cancer at an early enough stage for them to be effectively treated. Cancer will strike 985,000 Americans this year, according to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. About 49 percent of cancer patients survive five years after diagnosis. More than 49,000 Americans get bladder cancer each year and about 10,000 die annually, the cancer institute said. The five-year survival rate is 77 percent. The researchers are now using the test on volunteers from the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, where bladder cancer is a more serious problem, <PERSON> Guirguis </PERSON> said. If these expanded trials show that the test is accurate, it can be used as a screening test _ to diagnose cancer _ and as a follow-up to determine whether treatment has eradicated cancer. `` The follow-up of these patients is extremely important,'' <PERSON> Guirguis </PERSON> said. Widespread use of the test awaits completion of the large-scale trials in progress, <PERSON> Guirguis </PERSON> said. The test is based on the detection of the protein autocrine motility factor. `` The protein is produced in the transformed or malignant cells,'' <PERSON> Guirguis </PERSON> said. `` We think it's stimulating the movement of the cancer cells and aiding their invasion _ metastasis.'' The researchers used a very sensitive test that allows detection of minute amounts of a chemical. Researchers hope to develop an even simpler version of the test that would consist of a paper strip that would turn color if the protein were present, <PERSON> Guirguis </PERSON> said. Such a test could be manufactured for only a few cents per test, and could thus be used widely to screen people for cancer. For some cancers the test might be used with urine, and for other cancers it might be used to look for the protein in blood. <PERSON> Guirguis </PERSON> and his colleagues said in their report that in patients with spreading bladder cancer the protein occurs at higher levels than in patients with localized bladder cancer. And it is absent in patients without cancer. The researchers are trying to make sure the protein is not secreted in the absence of cancer. They have determined that it is not present during pregnancy or in inflammatory conditions, <PERSON> Guirguis </PERSON> said. `` That's different from other tests that people have used,'' he said.

<HEAD>Brazil To Enact New Constitution, Consolidate Democracy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> today is to enact a new constitution consolidating the country's return to democratic government after 21 years of right-wing military rule. `` This is a historic date for our country,'' President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> told Brazilians Tuesday night in a nationwide TV broadcast. `` We have reached the end of a long path ... My mission of helping the country through its transition to democracy is fulfilled.'' The 559 legislators doubling as a constituent assembly worked for 19 months on the 245-article document that governs everything from interest rates to mining rights and land reform. The charter is <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s eighth since independence from <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> in 1822 and replaces the authoritarian document handed down by military generals in 1969. `` The new constitution will consolidate a representative and participatory democracy,'' the president of the constituent assembly, Rep. <PERSON> Ulysses </PERSON> <PERSON> Guimaraes </PERSON> said in a press conference. `` For the first time the individual will have precedence over the state.'' <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>, who at times fought bitterly against left-leaning measures in the new document, said in his broadcast he would be the constitution's `` greatest servant.'' In earlier broadcasts, <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> made veiled threats that if certain articles were passed, the military might refuse to respect the new constitution. The constitution removes many of the arbitrary powers used by the military government during its harsh rule. The document abolishes the president's power to simply decree laws, ends censorship, prohibits torture, guarantees political rights and broadens workers' right to strike and to unionize. Nationalistic legislators also managed to limit mineral mining to national companies and prohibit further oil drilling risk contracts between the state-run <ORGANIZATION> Petrobras </ORGANIZATION>, which has a monopoly on oil exploration and drilling in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, and international companies. At the same time, the right-wing scored a victory, managing to water-down a land reform law that protects `` productive land'' from expropriation. The law further stalls <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>'s program to distribute land to 1.4 million peasant families, in a country where 2 percent of landowners hold 60 pecent of arable land. Judiciary analysts have said, however, there are many articles in the hefty document that will be difficult to define or to enforce in complimentary legislation. <ORGANIZATION> Guimaraes </ORGANIZATION>, 72, said the charter would be respected by all _ including the Armed Forces. `` The military period left deep marks. There is an awareness that the regime is good and from the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> we have heard only words of support and confidence in the stability of democracy,'' <ORGANIZATION> Guimaraes </ORGANIZATION> said. The enactment of the new constituion will be marked by day-long celebrations starting early today with an open-air mass before the twin-domed <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and a reception for delegates from more than 30 Latin American and Portuguese-speaking nations. <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> 58, became president in 1985 after President-elect <PERSON> Tancredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Neves </PERSON> died before taking office.

 Vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is sounding confident about his showdown tonight with Republican <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> although the Democrat's staff is downplaying expectations by expressing concern. `` Are you going to be standing behind me as we open the <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> season early tomorrow night?'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> asked a flag-waving crowd of more than 500 who greeted him at the <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> airport Tuesday night. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator hammered the Republicans on issues he's bound to raise, given the chance, in the first nationally broadcast debate between the two candidates. `` Tomorrow night we're going to have 90 minutes to present <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' vision of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> _ an <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> on the move, an <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that believes in excellence in education for all of our children,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. It would be, he said, `` a Democratic administration that's committed to protecting Social Security against the Republican raids that have come year after year with <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> voting eight times to cut Social Security. He said the Democrats would pursue health insurance for the uninsured while `` the opposition has done nothing.'' `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is committed to an <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that is number one in the economy of the world and ... number one in national defense,'' he said, later citing the huge budget deficits of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years. One of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s goals will be to counter what he contends are distortions of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' positions on defense and crime-fighting _ important issues in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and other Southern states where <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is working hardest for the ticket. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> has led a nearly cloistered existence for four days, taking part in issues briefings and conducting mock debates in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, and later in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. But he set off for <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> with a flurry, speaking at a campaign rally at the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> state capitol and later at the <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> airport. Campaign staff said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> again would slip behind closed doors today, except for a quick midday trip to examine the setup in the auditorium and later the debate itself. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> talked casually with reporters on his campaign plane en route to <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, appearing relaxed and upbeat. But his staff continued to try to blunt public expectations that the powerful <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> would thrash the less experienced <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. Despite days of practice, aides said the 67-year-old <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator was not adept at the media-age need to boil down his statements into one - and two-minute sound bites Press secretary <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON>, who was <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s stand-in for <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> in mock debates in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> on Tuesday, said the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate was looking for `` the best way of making a point memorable or punchy,'' and he was still having trouble with the time limits. `` The red light goes off frequently,'' he said. `` It's all a matter of getting ready to present it -LRB- his positions -RRB- in two-minute answers and one-minute rebuttals,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' campaign manager who was helping brief <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. `` Our counsel to him has been to be himself.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> displayed no sign of being unsure of himself. `` Tomorrow is a big day for us, and a big day for this campaign,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told the crowd of about 1,500 people at the <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> rally. `` And I ca n't think of a greater way to start it than surrounded by friends here on the capitol steps of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said the Democrats offered `` proven and tested leadership.'' `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> hear no questions and offer no answers. They tell us to lower our sights, to live on our past, rest on our laurels,'' while the <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> would offer new leadership, he said.

 <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> plans to do some research to find out why its coverage of the Summer Olympics fell more than 3 rating points short of the guarantee to advertisers _ a discrepancy that could cost the network millions. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> vice president for research projects, said the network probably would n't make the results of the study public, since it could bear on competition with the 1992 games. But among the likeliest contributors: the 14-hour time difference between <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that put live coverage of such popular events as gymnastics in the morning, and the late September-early-October timing. The games ended Sunday, and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s coverage had an average <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> rating of 17.9 _ not counting opening and closing ceremonies _ considerably lower than the 21.2 rating <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> had promised advertisers. The 1984 summer games from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> had averaged a 23.2 for <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. Each rating point represents 904,000 households with television. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> will have to give advertisers as much as $ 70 million in commercial time, to make up for what had been promised, according to the Wall Street Journal. CBS has been awarded the TV contract for the next Winter Olympics, which will be held in 1992, and expects to make a bid for that year's summer games. The network also is studying <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s results But CBS' vice President for marketing, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Poltrack </PERSON>, thinks the 1988 Olympics suffered mainly from competition with other sports and from time pressures on viewers, especially students back in school. `` I attribute a lot of the under-delivery of ratings to the fall scheduling. It's not necessarily typical of what we can expect in future Olympics,'' said <PERSON> Poltrack </PERSON>. The 1992 games, in <LOCATION> Barcelona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, will be earlier in the summer. Nonetheless, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s six nights of Olympics coverage last week took six of the the top 10 spots in the Nielsen ratings and gave <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> a decisive victory over <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and CBS. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> had an average 17.5 rating to <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s 12.3 and CBS' 11.2. It also provided an important promotional base for <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s new fall shows. `` The actual performance by the Olympics in key groups -LRB- of viewers -RRB- was a really dominant performance. Whether it was as dominant as anticipated, that's something else,'' said <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON>. The closing ceremonies Sunday fell to a 12.3 rating. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> had expected closer to 20.0. CBS' `` 60 Minutes,'' `` Murder, She Wrote'' and the movie `` Cocoon'' out-rated the Sunday coverage, as did `` Liberace'' on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. Those four shows made up the rest of the top 10. The closing ceremonies ranked 22 out of 55 shows. During the games' first week, ratings tended to climb as the week wore on. The second week, they tended to decline. Monday's coverage was the highest-rated show of the week, with a 19.3 rating <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` World News Tonight'' won in the news Nielsens with a 10.0 rating. The `` CBS Evening News'' was second with a 9.8. `` NBC Nightly News,'' pre-empted on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> by Olympics coverage, had a 9.6. The week's lowest-rated prime-time shows were: `` Live! <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> Presents,'' `` Wiseguy,'' `` Mutts,'' `` Beauty & amp; the <LOCATION> Beast </LOCATION>,'' `` Equalizer,'' `` Mr. <PERSON> Belvedere </PERSON> _ Sunday,'' `` Deal of the Century,'' `` <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s Place,'' `` First Impressions'' and a paid political program by <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> announced Tuesday that due to low ratings it had canceled `` <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s Place,'' the critically acclaimed comedy starring <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> as the owner of a <ORGANIZATION> Creole </ORGANIZATION> restaurant in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. Also Tuesday, the union that represents <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s technical workers said the network has offered to buy out the jobs of 140 New York-based engineers and technicians. `` If all 140 people accept, they will pay it, although they are aiming to cut only 40 positions,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> McElroy </PERSON>, a spokesman for Local 11 of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> and Technicians. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, like <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, has dramatically reduced its payroll since it was taken over, in its case by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, two years ago. About 400 people in the news division lost their jobs and 110 others are scheduled to go before the end of the year.

 A 28-year-old man who hijacked a Brazilian jetliner with more than 100 people aboard has died following a five-hour police interrogation, hospital officials said. <PERSON> Raimundo </PERSON> <PERSON> Conceicao </PERSON>, described by authorities as a `` psychopath,'' died Tuesday of kidney failure after five days of steady progress, according to a medical report released by the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Genoveva </LOCATION> hospital in <LOCATION> Goiania </LOCATION>, 850 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>. On Sep. 29, <PERSON> Conceicao </PERSON> underwent surgery to stop internal bleeding caused by police bullet wounds suffered as the hijacking drew to a close. On Sunday, <PERSON> Conceicao </PERSON> underwent five hours of intense questioning by police on the hijacking. Late Monday afternoon, <PERSON> Conceicao </PERSON> was rushed to the hospital's intensive care unit with soaring blood pressure. The causes of <PERSON> Conceicao </PERSON>'s sudden change in condition were unknown, according to the medical report, but a doctor who asked not to be identified said <PERSON> Conceicao </PERSON>'s soaring blood pressure could have been prompted by a build-up of intestinal gases during the interrogation. Doctors on Monday refused to let police talk to <PERSON> Conceicao </PERSON>, saying his health had deteriorated. The contents of <PERSON> Conceicao </PERSON>'s police deposition were not made public On Sep. 29, <PERSON> Conceicao </PERSON> burst into the cockpit of a Brazilian jetliner on a routine flight from western <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> and demanded the plane be flown to the federal capital of <LOCATION> Brasilia </LOCATION>. He reportedly told negotiators he wanted to crash the plane into a government building to `` settle accounts'' with the government over its economic policies. The plane was forced to land 125 miles southwest of the capital, in <LOCATION> Goiania </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Conceicao </PERSON> shot and killed the co-pilot and wounded two others before being wounded by police as he prepared to change planes. On Monday, government officials announced passengers at major Brazilian airports will now have their baggage checked before boarding domestic flights. Previously, only passengers boarding international flights were subject to police checks.

 Vice presidential candidates <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> applied the final touches to their strategy for tonight's nationally broadcast debate as the two presidential contenders vowed to help <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s forgotten class Republican <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> promised to focus his attack on Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, not his debate opponent <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, when the two running mates clash at the Civic Auditorium in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is running for president, and he's the one I'm very concerned about becoming president. It would be a very troubling notion for many Americans,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told reporters Tuesday on his campaign plane from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is hoping to counter what he believes are distortions of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' record, especially the Democratic presidential nominee's stand on defense and crime `` Tomorrow night we're going to have 90 minutes to present <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' vision of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> _ an <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> on the move, an <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that believes in excellence in education for all of our children,'' the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator told a flag-waving crowd of more than 500 people at the <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> airport. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s running mate _ the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor _ was limiting his campaign appearances today, tending to gubernatorial duties in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and later attending a debate-watching party. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was speaking to high school students in <LOCATION> Littleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, before addressing rallies in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The vice presidential candidates were planning walk-throughs at the refurbished Civic Auditorium around midday before their own last minute preparations for the debate. Organizers said Tuesday that the 10,000-seat hall was ready for the debate after workers put the finishing touches on network anchor booths, patriotic bunting and even a red-carpeted `` spin valley'' where Democrats and Republicans will expound on their views of the debate for any reporter who wants to listen. `` We think we've got this hall turned into what we want, and that is a debate hall,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Fouhy </PERSON>, producer of the event. A national poll released Tuesday found <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s presence on the Republican ticket doing some damage to the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> cause, and put the race for the White House at essentially a dead heat. In the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll, the <ORGANIZATION> Bush-Quayle </ORGANIZATION> ticket drew the support of 48 percent of the 1,034 probable voters surveyed while Dukakis-Bentsen got 46 percent. When the respondents were asked about the presidential nominees, without their running mates, the support for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> declined to 43 percent while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> remained at 48 percent. The poll, conducted Saturday through Monday, had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points. On Tuesday, the <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> campaign was setting low expectations for its vice presidential candidate in the debate, with aides to the candidate suggesting that he was not adept at boiling down his positions to one-minute sound bites. The campaign is trying to dispel the belief that the more experienced <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> would manhandle the junior senator from <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, however, was buoyed by his chances. `` Are you going to be standing behind me as we open the <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> season early tomorrow night?'' he asked the airport crowd. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was providing few details on his debate strategy, but promised to `` just be myself'' as he `` communicates with the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public in an unedited version.'' `` They'll be able to see <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as I really am,'' he said. `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people do n't know me. They have a lot of questions ... They do n't have any details of who <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s running mate <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> used a speech in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, to propose a $ 100 million program to encourage community volunteer service by young people. `` I want our affluent to help our poor,'' the vice president said of his <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engaged </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> plan. `` I want the young men and women of our tree-lined suburbs to get on a bus, or the subway, or the metro, and go into the cities where the want is.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, meanwhile, told a rally in <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, that his <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would care about the plight of struggling families. `` I care about working people and working families and that's the difference between <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and Democrats and Republicans,'' he said `` We care.'' The Democratic nominee also compared <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s attempts to portray the <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> as a party only interested in the nation's negatives as the same tactic used by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> 28 years ago. `` They said the same thing about <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> in 1960 _ all that gloom and doom,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` And what was he saying? ` We can do better.''' In his campaign stops in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> underscored the theme of his latest ads, titled `` The Packaging of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' which depict the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee as a product of media experts and a candidate with no solution to the nation's problems. `` He offers slogans and symbols; we offer solutions,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. Aides say the ad series is expected to cost the campaign more than $ 1 million. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign, meanwhile, released an attack ad aimed at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' handling of the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> prison furlough system, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>. The ad shows inmates walking through a revolving door while an announcer says the state's system gave weekend passes to first-degree murderers and crime statistics appear on the screen. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign has repeatedly criticized <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the case of <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>, who raped a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> woman and stabbed her fiance while on a weekend furlough.

 Children with AIDS improve dramatically when given the drug AZT, regaining lost intelligence, speech and the ability to walk, according to a study. However, the drug does not cure the disease, and children continue to die despite the treatment, researchers said. The results of the research were widely publicized when presented at an international AIDS meeting in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> in June. A detailed report on the treatment was published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine. HIV, the AIDS virus, destroys the body's immune system and damages the brain. In children, these neurological problems are particularly severe. Youngsters' intelligence falls, and they often lose their ability to walk and talk. The drug AZT, also known as zidovudine or Retrovir, is already the mainstay of treatment for adults with AIDS. In the latest study, doctors gave the medicine to 21 AIDS victims who ranged from age 1 to 12. Of these, 62 percent had clear evidence of brain damage caused by HIV, and every one improved. Overall, IQ scores rose 15 points, and in some cases the youngsters' intelligence returned to the level before they got sick. The study by Dr. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pizzo </PERSON> and colleagues from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> concluded that AZT produced `` consistent and dramatic improvement in symptoms.'' The IQ of an 11-year-old boy had fallen from 99 to 71 after the start of AIDS symptoms. Within nine months of getting AZT, his IQ was back to 99. Even those with no obvious brain damage showed increases in IQ. The doctors said this may be particularly important, because it suggests that the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome may have subtle effects on youngsters' mental functions. Brain scans also showed that shrunken tissue in the youngsters' heads had returned substantially after treatment Despite the improvements, however, five of the youngsters died during the year-long study.

<HEAD>Bishops Object To Politician's Threats To Religious Freedom</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A high-ranking official of the ruling party has threatened to strip an outspoken Anglican bishop of his freedom to worship, but other clergmen have vowed to defy any infringement on their religious rights. <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> <PERSON> Mudavadi </PERSON>, secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Kenya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, threatened to strip <PERSON> Biship </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Gitari </PERSON> of his freedom to worship after the bishop criticized the way the ruling party adopted resolutions. `` You should not be surprised if we, as a KANU government, removed that freedom from you through <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Mudavadi </PERSON> said to <PERSON> Gitari </PERSON> in comments reported Saturday by <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s three English-language newspapers. Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Manasses </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuria </PERSON>, in a Sunday sermon to a <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION> parish, said the Church of the Province of <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> would not allow anyone to deny Christians the right to worship. `` The freedom of worship is God-given and can not be taken away at will by any individual,'' <PERSON> Kuria </PERSON> said. Anglican Bishop <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Muge </PERSON>, of the <LOCATION> Rift </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eldoret </LOCATION> province, said <PERSON> Mudavadi </PERSON>'s comments marked a `` sad moment for our independent <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>. `` Prison cells and enough graveyards must be prepared before the decree is effected because many will continue to worship whether Mr. <PERSON> Mudavadi </PERSON> likes it or not,'' <PERSON> Muge </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Muge </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Kuria </LOCATION> were quoted by the English-language <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION> and The Standard. The <ORGANIZATION> Kenya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, which is owned by the ruling party, also reported <PERSON> Kuria </PERSON>'s remarks. <PERSON> Gitari </PERSON>, bishop of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> diocese </LOCATION>, angered politicians by saying delegates to the party's conference rubber-stamped the party's resolutions. The <ORGANIZATION> Kenya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> is <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s sole legal political party. On Thursday, legislators lambasted <PERSON> Gitari </PERSON>, accusing him and three other outspoken clergymen of trying to destabilize the government. It was the second time in three months parliamentarians have suspended legislative business to criticize clergy members, a sign of increasing friction between the government of President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> arap </PERSON> <PERSON> Moi </PERSON> and Anglican clergy, who have spoken out against alleged government corruption and human rights abuses. <PERSON> Muge </PERSON> said he was briefly detained on July 17 and police kept parishioners from entering his church after one run-in with the government.

<HEAD>Threats Of Strike Violence Stop Production At Television Studio</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In two days of picketing, the <ORGANIZATION> Hollywood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>' strike has accomplished what scriptwriters failed to achieve over five months in their walkout: the shutdown of a studio. Citing death threats, bomb scares and sabotaged equipment, <ORGANIZATION> Cannell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it has halted production on its television shows `` Hunter'' and `` <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Spoon </PERSON>.'' It said the incidents were related to the strike by 3,200 drivers, laborers and electricians and that production would resume work only when it is safe. In a separate incident, one picket was arrested for battery Tuesday morning at <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION>, said police Lt. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. The picket was released on $ 250 bail. A <PERSON> Cannell </PERSON> spokeswoman said production of the <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> programs was suspended because tires were slashed or deflated on nine vehicles, a brake line was severed on a semi-trailer, holding tanks were punctured on a mobile dressing room, a trailer hitch was sabotaged and at least three employees were physically assaulted. Employees also received death threats and the company's <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> office received a bomb scare, said the spokeswoman, <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewinson </PERSON>. The office building, containing several hundred employees, was evacuated for more than two hours Monday, the first day of the strike. <PERSON> Lewinson </PERSON> said the company was `` outraged by the acts of violence, vandalism and threats to our employees and property.'' The studio planned to resume production `` as soon as possible with or without an end to the strike.'' A Teamster official denied that the union members had done anything illegal. `` All of the members were advised that they were to conduct themselves in a lawful manner,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Prelock </PERSON>, director of legal and contract affairs. `` We're going to do everything that's lawfully permissible and nothing more,'' he said. `` Sure, there's liable to be emotions. Hopefully, the reactions are simply that and nothing more. We are not personally aware of any physical violence.'' Teamsters pickets were stationed Tuesday at nearly every Hollywood studio. The Teamsters drivers, who transport actors, equipment and props for television and movie producers, picketed Monday at the <PERSON> Cannell </PERSON> offices and the outdoor productions of `` Sonny Spoon'' at an undisclosed location and of `` Hunter'' at the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION> pier. At the `` Hunter'' filming, some pickets blew air horns and banged on a trash container during scenes. Filming was delayed by more than an hour and the production closed earlier than scheduled Monday evening, <PERSON> Lewinson </PERSON> said. `` Hunter'' stars former pro football player <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Dryer </PERSON> as a quick-witted detective; `` <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Spoon </PERSON>,'' an <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> adventure program, features <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Peebles </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Cannell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> are named after producer-scriptwriter <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannell </PERSON>, who also created `` The Rockford Files'' and `` The A-Team.'' There have been other reported bomb threats related to the strike, said police Sgt. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. At least one other studio complained that some replacement drivers had been harassed by pickets. `` These actions will not be tolerated,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. The incidents `` are not only inappropriate, but perhaps illegal. ... We expect and demand that no further incidents take place. And we call on the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> to take appropriate action to ensure that their strike be conducted in a legal and nonviolent atmosphere.'' The strike against the 217-member alliance began early Monday after weekend negotiations collapsed. On Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> voted 1,441-196 to reject the contract proposal submitted by the alliance. Unresolved issues include overtime rules for weekend work, salary rates, wages for out-of-town film and television production and guidelines for the making of nonunion films. Some drivers are being asked to take a pay cut from $ 16.61 to $ 14 per hour. Although the five-month strike by the 9,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> halted much of the industry's production, it never caused any the alliance members to close their doors and halt production.

<HEAD>Antibiotic Appears To Help Some Women With Premenstrual Syndrome</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Women suffering from premenstrual syndrome should react cautiously to a new report suggesting that a common antibiotic may help ease symptoms in some, says a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> researcher. Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubinow </PERSON>, a psychiatrist and clinical director at the institute, said many treatments have been proposed for premenstrual syndrome but none have been proven to work. `` I think the whole area of premenstrual syndrome has been characterized by a new story and a new treatment every year for the last 50 years,'' he said. He made the comment following an announcement Tuesday that the antibiotic doxycycline could ease symptoms in women who had an unrecognized underlying infection. The report by Dr. <PERSON> Atilla </PERSON> <PERSON> Toth </PERSON>, a gynecologist at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital-Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, was published in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Rubinow </PERSON> said he was not familiar with <PERSON> Toth </PERSON>'s study, but he had some general comments about premenstrual syndrome, which is one of his research interests. `` While I ca n't reject the results of this study out of hand without having an opportunity to review the work, I would simply urge considerable caution in the interpretation of this data, lest people run out and demand the latest of a long series of treatments that may not be effective, at best, and may be associated with complications, at worst.'' At a press conference, <PERSON> Toth </PERSON> said that 15 women who were given the antibiotic and asked to rate their symptoms showed a `` highly significant improvement in the symptom score at the end of the month.'' Fifteen others given a placebo showed little change in symptoms. <PERSON> Toth </PERSON> said an estimated 90 percent of women suffer from premenstrual syndrome during their reproductive years, and about one-fourth of those have symptoms severe enough to disrupt their professional or personal lives. The symptoms can include weight gain, breast tenderness, extreme irritability, fatigue and sometimes suicidal tendencies, he said. He said he does not know how many of the women may have infections and could therefore be helped by the antibiotic. `` I do n't think there's going to be one approach that's going to answer the universe of patients that have this difficulty,'' he said. Doxycycline is a commonly used drug without severe side effects, <PERSON> Rubinow </PERSON> said. The danger is that doctors who do not do a careful evaluation of a patient may prescribe it and miss another underlying psychiatric or medical condition that could be treated, he said. <PERSON> Toth </PERSON> said seven of the women studied remained free of symptoms as long as three years after taking doxycycline. His explanation is that low-grade infections in these women are disrupting the lining of the uterus or the function of the ovaries, producing hormonal irregularities that result in the symptoms of premenstrual syndrome.

<HEAD>Amnesty Cites Human Rights Abuses In Record 135 Countries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BEN DOBBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Amnesty International today accused a record 135 nations of abusing human rights in its annual report, but it hailed the creation of more than 1,000 human rights groups as well as new laws to protect prisoners. The violations charged by the human rights group in its report include execution of a mentally retarded man in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and killing of unarmed Afghan civilians by Soviet and government troops. Amnesty said the list of offenders for 1987 was the longest it has published since the organization was founded in 1961. Amnesty, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1977, recorded abuses last year in more than 80 percent of the 159 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> member But it said it was encouraged by the emergence of more than 1,000 human rights groups in recent years and the proliferation of laws to protect prisoners' rights. It added: `` More than ever before in world history, governments are exposed to the glare of international publicity _ the greatest weapon we have.'' It said at least 760 political prisoners were executed in 39 countries in 1987 but estimated the number probably was much higher because of secret executions. It also reported that governments used a variety of methods to deflect criticism, including death squads in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The 278-page report said: `` In at least half the countries of the world, people are locked away for speaking their minds, often after trials that are no more than a sham. In at least a third of the world's nations, men, women and even children are tortured. In scores of countries, governments pursue their goals by kidnapping and murdering their own citizens.'' The report cited the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where 25 prisoners were put to death last year, for executing <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Brogdon </PERSON>, a man diagnosed as mentally retarded. He was executed July 30, 1987, in the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> electric chair for raping, torturing, and murdering an 11-year-old girl. The group also said `` substanstial doubts'' clouded the conviction of <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who was executed in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>'s gas chamber on May 20, 1987, for murdering a marshall in a small town. Amnesty opposes the death penalty. The report said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> released 259 people, most of them prisoners of conscience. But it added that nearly 200 were pardoned under secret decrees that falsely implied they were criminals and `` hid the fact that they had been unjustly imprisoned in the first place.'' Authorities held 300 other Soviet prisoners of conscience in prisons, in exile or in psychiatric hospitals, it said. Soviet and Afghan troops, often in reprisal attacks against anti-communist rebels, killed dozens of unarmed civilians in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, the report said. In <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, more than 200 convicted criminals were put to death for offenses ranging from murder and rape to drug smuggling, theft and `` showing pornographic movies.'' But that figure represents only a fraction of the total number of death sentences and executions, the report said. <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> closed channels of information to hide violations, it said, and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> clamped down on the reporting of abuses by denying prisoners access to lawyers or families. It said the death from torture of a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> student, Park Chong-chol, in January 1987 sparked widespread protests that resulted in the prosecutions of eight police officers and the resignation of government ministers. `` Today, even one death can set off waves of anger and protest worldwide ... It does n't always happen but it can,'' <PERSON> Amnesty </PERSON> said. Among other abuses were the reported massacre by Sudanese forces of hundreds of unarmed Dinka tribespeople, the summary execution by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> of hundreds of unarmed Kurds, the disappearance of hundreds of Peruvian farmers seized by government forces, and court-ordered executions <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The report cited politically motivated killings by pro-government assassins in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, as well as arbitrary arrests, torture and killings in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> was cited for torturing Basque separatist prisoners; <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> for failing to publish a police inquiry into the killings of six unarmed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas in 1982; and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> for jailing draft objectors. In <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the report said, a court permitted the secret service to use `` a moderate measure of physical pressure'' in interrogating suspects. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> executed at least 158 people, although the true number was probably higher, it said.

<TEXT>
 A Michelangelo drawing of the suicide of Cleopatra, discovered last August, will go on display for the first time Sunday at the National Gallery of Art. The drawing had not been noticed before because it was on the reverse side of a better known work that had been pasted onto a backing. It was revealed when conservators removed the better-known drawing, which also depicts the ancient Egyptian ruler, because it was not being preserved properly on the backing. The well-known drawing on the front illustrates the traditional story of her suicide, in which she had an asp brought to her in a basket of figs and put it on her arm. It shows the snake biting her breast. <PERSON> Cleopatra </PERSON>'s hair is carefully dressed and her expression is calm and melancholy. The newly-found drawing, much less finished, shows her hair in disorder, her eyes staring out at the viewer and her mouth open as if in a scream. It will be at the gallery's West Building until Dec. 11.

<TEXT>
 The House has killed a move to set ways for reviewing the continued detention of Cubans who entered the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> during the 1980 Mariel boatlift. Under legislation defeated Tuesday by a 271-144 vote, <PERSON> Mariel </PERSON> aliens denied parole would have been given the right to a hearing before an administrative law judge.

The legislation provided that to continue detention, the department would have to prove that the detainee would pose a threat to the community or would violate reasonable conditions of release. More than 125,000 Cubans came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> between April and October 1980, when <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> opened its port of Mariel for citizens wishing to leave.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says its agents destroyed 51 percent more marijuana plants this summer than they did in all of last year. A department announcement Tuesday said law enforcement officers were not sure whether the increase `` meant that drug activity actually is increasing on federal lands or whether it merely reflects the department's intensified enforcement efforts.'' The department is in charge of the national parks, battlefields, monuments, seashores and recreation areas; Indian reservations; wildlife refuges and other public land, mostly in the West. Interior agencies seized and destroyed 166,000 marijuana plants from mid-June to mid-September this year compared with 110,000 plants in all of last year, the department said.

<DATELINE>BLACKPOOL, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The leader of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s transit workers union warns that the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, by moving to the center to broaden its appeal, could jeopardize its standing with its strongest supporters. `` They want our money and our strength, but they fear our power,'' <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>, head of the 1.25 million-member Transport and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday night during a meeting at the party's annual conference. `` There is a real division in the party which needs to be bridged as a matter of urgency,'' he said. <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>'s broadside marked the first serious public clash at the weeklong conference, which party leader <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> regards as a key step toward the adoption of a wholesale review of Labor policies. <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> controls one-fifth of the voting strength of the policy-making conference through a system under which the bosses of the <ORGANIZATION> Trades </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the national labor federation, wield huge blocks of votes allocated according to membership. The arrangement dates back to the turn of the century when the unions founded the party. In the 1920s, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> overtook the centrist Liberals to become, along with the currently governing Conservatives, one of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s two major parties The first post-World War II Labor government founded the welfare state and set up the free <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Earlier in the conference, which ends Friday, <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> and other top union chiefs used their block votes to ensure <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> a huge victory in a leadership challenge by the leader of <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s left, <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Benn </PERSON>. The union leaders also endorsed broadly the first phase of a two-stage policy review which acknowledges a permanent role for capitalism and drops previous commitments to wholesale renationalization of state-owned industries sold by Conservative Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. The unions are themselves divided between moderates and leftists such as <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>. But their near-unanimous stance in <LOCATION> Blackpool </LOCATION> reflected a tacit acceptance of <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON>'s argument that the party must modify its image as the only hope of regaining power after three election defeats by Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. Polls show that the clout of the unions, which fund the party and provided more than $ 3.3 million for the general election campaign in 1987, is itself a vote loser for Labor. <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON>'s aides said privately they were annoyed by <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>'s outburst soon after the leadership election ballot and the vote on the policy review The speech partly overshadowed <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON>'s keynote address Tuesday in which he said Labor must adopt new economic policies. He rejected charges that he was selling out Socialism. `` There is no concession to Thatcherism as great as letting it win again,'' said <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON>. <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> also is opposed to dropping Labor's electorally unpopular commitment to scrap <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s nuclear weapons unilaterally. The second - and third-biggest unions, engineers and municipal workers, are led by moderates who now suggest a reduction in union voting power in favor of legislators and local party branches at Labor conferences

<TEXT>
 Police today arrested an alleged aide of former Lt. Col. <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> `` Gringo'' <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>, and a senior officer claimed investigators were closing in on the renegade leader of last year's bloody coup attempt. Col. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Oxales </PERSON>, deputy military commander of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, told reporters former Master Sgt. <PERSON> Godofredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamboa </PERSON> was arrested early today during a raid on his home in suburban <LOCATION> Caloocan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> acknowledged that her government had failed to resolve many of the country's problems and restore social justice as promised after the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> administration collapsed. <PERSON> Oxales </PERSON> said the raiders also seized a .45 caliber pistol and assorted ammunition. <PERSON> Gamboa </PERSON>, a former counterintelligence agent, denied he was involved in any attempts to topple Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Oxales </PERSON> claimed <PERSON> Gamboa </PERSON>, who faces illegal weapons charges, was a `` close contact man'' of <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>, renegade leader of the Aug. 28, 1987, coup attempt. At least 53 people were killed and more than 300 were wounded in the failed coup. `` We are closely following the leads we are receiving, and we are closing in on ` Gringo,''' Oxales said. `` To get <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>, we are getting those people who are close to him.'' On Monday, police arrested three renegade soldiers sought in the failed coup and seized $ 5,000 dollars in pesos which Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Biazon </PERSON> said was apparently earmarked to finance another coup attempt. <PERSON> Oxales </PERSON> said information given by one of the three, Capt. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Baula </PERSON>, helped lead to today's arrest. He did not elaborate. Today's arrest brought to 74 the number of alleged right-wing extremists taken into custody in recent weeks. They include key officers who helped seize military and media facilities in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> and central <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION> during <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>'s coup attempt. <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> was arrested last December but escaped from a prison ship in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> the following April. <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> played a key role in the February 1986 military-civilian revolt which toppled President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and propelled Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to office. But <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> became disillusioned with Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> because of her alleged failure to crush the Communist rebellion and rid the government of corruption. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> acknowledged certain failings during an emotional eulogy for <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> `` Chino'' Roces, a newspaper publisher who convinced her to run for office but two years later rebuked her administration publicly for its failures. Roces, a leader in the struggle against <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, died Friday of cancer at the age of 75. After receiving the Legion of Honor from Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> last July, <PERSON> Roces </PERSON> publicly chided her for failing to establish a `` new moral order'' after the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> government collapsed. `` It hurt when he said it, but it had to be said,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said, her voice breaking with emotion. `` And he was one with the moral authority to say it. He has warned us that we, the friends of democracy, shall have a worse time of it than the clear enemies of the people if we fail the people.'' The Aquino government has faced growing criticism in the press over alleged corruption, mismanagement and the promotion of officials chosen more for their loyalty to the administration than their qualifications. In another development, the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> Constabulary announced today it had seized a Chinese research vessel off eastern <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION> after inspectors found weapons and ammunition aboard. The Science Research Vessel No. 1 was detained Monday off Casiguran after three machine guns, eight assault rifles, two semi-automatic rifles and 4,850 rounds of machine gun ammunition were found aboard, Capt. <PERSON> Edgardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingusan </PERSON> of the 119th <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constabulary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> said. Communist rebels operate in the remote area, which has few harbors and inadequate roads. In <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> embassy spokesman said the vessel dropped anchor off Casiguran to escape a tropical storm and the weapons were on board for self-defense. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> maintains diplomatic relations with the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Last April, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and was assured by <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> of his government's support for her.

 A 10-year-old <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> girl has been invited to spend a week in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> as a guest of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> after the two became pen pals, a military official said. <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> York </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Negaunee </LOCATION>, a town of 5,000 people in northern <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, and her mother, <PERSON> Pauline </PERSON> <PERSON> York </PERSON>, were to begin their visit today, said <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Maj. <PERSON> Edgardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Grimaldo </PERSON>. `` The girl has risen above the behavior of the adults that actually direct <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> politics,'' he said. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s de facto ruler and head of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, is under indictment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug trafficking charges.

<HEAD>Vietnamese Siamese Twins In Satisfactory Condition After
Separation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two 7-year-old Siamese twins were in satisfactory condition today after their separation in a 14-hour operation a day earlier in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> official said. A team of 72 doctors and nurses separated twins Viet and <PERSON> Duc </PERSON> in the operation at <LOCATION> Tu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Du </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Ho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Minh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, formerly <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION>. It was believed the first separation of Siamese twins who had been joined for more than seven years. <PERSON> Yoshiaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Nemoto </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Tadateru </PERSON> <PERSON> Konoe </PERSON>, one of three Japanese observers in the operation, as saying the twins were `` in satisfactory condition Wednesday morning.'' The medical team `` will keep a round-the-clock vigil on the two boys for four days'' until Saturday, <PERSON> Nemoto </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Konoe </PERSON> as reporting by phone from <LOCATION> Ho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Minh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The Japanese <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> provided some medical equipment and medicine needed in the operation, <PERSON> Nemoto </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> quoted a Vietnamese doctor as saying in <LOCATION> Ho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Minh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> that `` it will take about a week to tell the outcome'' of the operation. Viet and <PERSON> Duc </PERSON> were joined at the pelvis and had a single pair of legs. With their two torsos, they shared a large bowel, anus, bladder, genitals, one pair of kidneys and a major artery, leaving doctors with the difficult ethical question of how to divide their shared parts and give both a chance of survival. Japanese newspapers reported today that each twin received one leg, while the single organs went to <PERSON> Duc </PERSON>, the more healthy twin. Viet has been comatose since May 1986. Vietnamese officials have attributed a reported rise in the number of births of Siamese twins in the country to the American use of defoliants during the Vietnam War, including the central highlands area where Viet and <PERSON> Duc </PERSON> were born in February 1981. The defoliants included Agent Orange, which contains a compound, dioxin, known to produce birth defects in animals.

<HEAD>Student Government Shuts Down Campus Paper After Satire Published</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Editors at the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> campus here are wrangling with the student government over censorship after the student politicians shut down the newspaper over a satiric edition. The <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> withdrew funding for The Union last week because of the newspaper's satire supplement, `` The Grunion,'' which took as its theme the `` Sexually Frustrated Male.'' The issue featured phallic illustrations and a photograph of three nearly nude cavorters. Union editor <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Stark </PERSON>, who is appealing the decision to the student judiciary, charged the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> violated its own policies in its Sept. 28 decision. `` Our bylaws specifically state that staffing and editorial content shall not be subject to the review or approval of the <ORGANIZATION> A.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Stark </PERSON> said. Student body president <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said there is no First Amendment violation because the paper can continue without student funding. `` The $ 10,000 we give the Union comes from student fees. I have to ask myself, how appropriate is it to spend $ 10,000 on this?'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. Journalism professor <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON> said there is friction whenever campus papers are funded by student fees. `` It's an unholy alliance that invites this kind of thing to occur,'' said <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON>, adding that the editor exercised poor judgment and the student government overreacted. `` If the politicians did n't want to pay for a student newspaper, this was n't the time to make the decision. What they did was to make it very clearly a First Amendment issue,'' <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON> said. The school's administration has remained neutral.

<HEAD>California Chain Pulls Tobacco Products From Shelves</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s largest supermarket chain began removing cigars, pipe tobacco and chewing tobacco from shelves because the products are not labeled as cancer-causing in compliance with a state law. Cigarettes are not involved in the action announced Tuesday by <ORGANIZATION> Vons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> because they already carry a federally mandated warning label Several brands of chewing tobacco that carry such labels also are exempt. `` It's the first time we are aware of that a supermarket has taken product off the shelves in response to Proposition 65,'' said Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, the state enforcement coordinator for the law created by the November 1986 ballot initiative. The law requires the state to identify products and substances than can cause cancer, birth defects and sterility. Businesses must warn the public of `` significant'' amounts of the substances. <ORGANIZATION> Vons </ORGANIZATION> has 336 stores in the central and southern parts of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. It recently acquired 172 Safeway supermarkets in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The removal of 17 tobacco products produced by five companies was designed to comply with Proposition 65, said <ORGANIZATION> Vons </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Vickie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>. On Friday, state Attorney General <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON> filed a civil lawsuit against 25 tobacco manufacturers and eight food store chains, including <ORGANIZATION> Vons </ORGANIZATION>. The suit claimed the companies failed to warn consumers of the cancer risk of certain products. However, Ms. <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> that the decision to pull the products had nothing to do with the lawsuit. `` We did not do it without warning or notice to manufacturers. This is not a sudden move on <ORGANIZATION> Vons </ORGANIZATION>' part,'' she said. Tobacco manufacturers and distributors were told in August that <ORGANIZATION> Vons </ORGANIZATION> would require warning labels on products by Sept. 17, Ms. <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> said. That deadline later was extended until Monday, she said. The tobacco industry hoped it could comply with the law by posting signs in stores and other measures short of attaching warning labels to their products. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Cigar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Pipe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>: `` The warning message is, in fact, reaching the mass of cigar and pipe tobacco purchasers throughout the state. We do not think the producers' efforts, which have been timely and responsible, can be legitimately faulted.'' <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, assistant manager at Von's Westside Pavilion store, said she finished pulling the cigars and other items from shelves late Tuesday. So far, no customers had complained, she said. `` You will see bare shelves. There will be a sign up there telling customers we apologize for the inconvenience, but it is a necessary inconvenience,'' Ms. <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Safeway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the chain, which has 221 stores in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, gave manufacturers until Oct. 17 to label products or have shipments refused. Meantime, the stores have posted warning signs near cigar, pipe and chewing tobacco displays.

 <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s trustee has accepted a $ 115 million bid from a Canadian businessman for the Christian ministry's assets, but the buyer, who is Jewish, has n't said what he will do with the remnants of <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s empire The decision Tuesday came down to who offered `` the most money and the best terms,'' said bankruptcy trustee M.C. `` Red'' <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>. `` I'd hoped we could get a bit more for it. But this is not a bad price,'' said <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>, who spent nearly six months talking with bidders. One of them was <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, who nearly a month ago failed to secure the financing for his $ 172 million offer. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> gave a conditional blessing to the winning bid by <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> and I remain committed to the restoration of the ministry of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said in a statement. `` If the present offer is agreeable to the creditors, the partners -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s major donors -RRB- and the court, and God's will is satisfied with respect to the ministry of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>, we will be happy with that outcome.'' <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON>, 34, will pay $ 50 million at closing, which the contract set at no later than Dec. 31, and the balance over five years, said his attorney, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kluttz </PERSON>. If approved by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> will own the 500-acre <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>, a Christian retreat and theme park south of <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> satellite TV network; and 1,700 undeveloped acres in <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s religious functions have been separated from its other operations, and the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> is leasing back its facilities from <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> to continue on-site worship and Christian broadcasting. <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON>, an Orthodox Jew who was celebrating the holiday <PERSON> Simchat </PERSON> <PERSON> Torah </PERSON>, did not travel to <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> to attend Tuesday's new conference announcing the winning bid. <PERSON> Kluttz </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> has interests in real estate, clothing, garbage collection and landfills. `` His primary interest as a businessman is to get a maximum return on his investment,'' <PERSON> Kluttz </PERSON> said. In a Sept. 15 letter to <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> said he `` would welcome the opportunity to meet with representatives of any group or groups that are seriously interested in exploring ways of preserving or enhancing the Christian orientation of parts or all of the existing developed assets.'' <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Grubner </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON>'s attorney in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Charlotte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observer </ORGANIZATION> last month that <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> wanted <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> because `` it's a large tract of land, and I'm not sure those types of parcels are readily available.'' <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON>, who entered the negotiations a month ago, outbid fellow Canadian <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> offered $ 113 million, $ 46 million of it in cash, but not all would have been payable until September 1989. By signing <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON>'s contract, <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> agreed to stop negotiating with any other bidders and to file a motion with Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Rufus </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> recommending <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON>'s offer by Friday. Other bidders may still present offers directly to the court, but <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said his recommendation gives Mernick the upper hand. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> has said a firm bid must be submitted by Oct. 14 or he would order <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s assets sold to pay creditors, who are estimated to be owed more than $ 130 million. He is expected to hold a hearing on the bid in about a month. An assistant to <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Susanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Robicsek </PERSON>, said the judge `` does n't have any comment'' on the offer. <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> has been in bankruptcy reorganization since June 1987. Three months earlier, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> resigned after he admitted having a sexual encounter with <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> in 1980 and disclosed that money was paid to silence the former church secretary. Some <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> employees were relieved by Tuesday's announcement. The pastor of <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Village </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, the Rev. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, said: `` The man is not buying the ministry. He is buying the assets of <LOCATION> Heritage </LOCATION> <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>. That's important to us because our objective is to continue to preach the good news of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>.'' `` I'm glad we finally have a buyer and know which way we're going,'' said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, a security administrative assistant `` I think the whole staff feels like partying.''

 The dollar inched up against the Japanese yen today, while share prices fell moderately on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average again lost 95.53 points, or 0.35 percent, following Tuesday's 44.51-point drop. The index gained 72.25 points in the early morning, reaching 27,573.27, but headed down and closed at 27,501.02 points. Since Oct. 1, the index has lost 518.18 points even though the second half of the fiscal year has begun, when market trading should be active, dealers said. `` There is no negative factor in the economy that should lead the market to keep losing,'' said <PERSON> Yoshio </PERSON> <PERSON> Shimoyama </PERSON> with the <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. He said increased selling for profit-taking resulted in the Nikkei's decline today. `` Also, there was some cautiousness among investors before the -LRB- announcement of the -RRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> umemployment rate'' for September, scheduled for Friday, he said. But <PERSON> Shimoyama </PERSON> implied the major market-affecting factor was participants' uncertainty about ailing Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, whose condition was reported stable but serious. The 87-year-old <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> has been bedridden and continues to hemorrhage since he vomited blood Sept. 19. Volume traded on the first section of the exchange was estimated at 1 billion shares. On the foreign exchange market, the dollar closed at 133.48 yen, up 0.33 yen from Tuesday's close of 133.15 yen. Opening slightly lower at 133.40 yen, the currency ranged within a tight range of 133.40-133 .57 yen `` The dollar-yen rate was moving very little,'' said a dealer with the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` Participants remained on the sidelines as the release of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unemployment figure approaches, and were just adjusting the amount of currencies they've had,'' he said.

 Heavy readers take heart. The long-awaited second edition of `` The Oxford English Dictionary'' will weigh in at a whopping 137 pounds worth of words. The venerable OED, world's biggest dictionary, is getting bigger. `` We are sure we will sell a lot because the dictionary is the standard work of reference on the English language and any substantial library will have to have it,'' said <PERSON> Ludo </PERSON> <PERSON> Craddock </PERSON>, promotions executive of the <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The tumescent tome will span 22,000 pages, fill 20 voluminous volumes and sell for about $ 2,500. The publishing house, founded in 1584, describes the dictionary as its most adventurous project since it began the first edition in the 19th century. But the first edition had a mere 44 million words of text and the second has 59 million. There are 290,500 main entries on different words, a 15 percent increase from the first edition. In addition, there are 157,000 combinations and derivatives and 169,000 phrases making a total of 616,500 `` word forms'' which are defined. The 1928 edition had 414,825. The OED was first published in parts between 1884 and 1928 and a supplement of new words and words missed the first time was added in 1933. Together, they made up 13 volumes. The last of four additional volumes was finished in 1986 by New Zealander <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Burchfield </PERSON>, who spent 29 years on the project.

 Four <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> airman were missing at sea and presumed dead after a search off the coast failed to turn up survivors of a nighttime crash of a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> helicopter, authorities said. The SH-3H Sea King helicopter crashed early Tuesday about 80 miles off <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> while involved in maneuvers with the aircraft carrier <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ranger </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. An 18-hour search for the crew was called off at dusk Tuesday. The craft's four crew members were assigned to <ORGANIZATION> Antisubmarine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helicopter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Squadron </ORGANIZATION> 14 based at <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. The co-pilot was identified as Lt. j.g. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>, 26, of <LOCATION> Hesperia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>. Two crewmen were identified as <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, 22, of <LOCATION> Lawrenceburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmquist </PERSON>, 22, of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, both aviation anti-submarine warfare operators, 2nd class The name of the pilot was withheld pending notification of relatives. The crew was conducting `` plane guard'' duty for the Ranger in which choppers take to the air during carrier flight operations so they will be in position to quickly rescue ditched fliers if their planes go down. The cause of accident, which occurred shortly after midnight, was under investigation, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. The Sikorsky-built Sea Kings were introduced to the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> fleet in 1965 as the mainstay anti-submarine helicopter assigned to carrier air wings, and later, to other warships fitted with landing platforms. The choppers also are used for search and rescue missions. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has begun to replace the older <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kings </ORGANIZATION> with SH-60B Seahawks, also built by <PERSON> Sikorsky </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Father Turns Detective, Evidence Returns Son's Killer To Jail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A father who lost his son in a hit-and-run accident turned detective when he discovered that the man banned from driving for killing his 14-year-old was driving again. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Proctor </PERSON> tracked <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Stratton </PERSON> with a camera and video equipment in a specially converted van to prove <PERSON> Stratton </PERSON> was violating the driving ban, a court heard this week. His evidence helped send <PERSON> Stratton </PERSON> back to prison. `` I sat in my van and used a telescopic lens to get pictures of him coming out of a pub and driving away,'' <PERSON> Proctor </PERSON> said. `` I lost count of the footage of video film I used but it was all worth it.'' <PERSON> Stratton </PERSON>, 29, pleaded guilty to two charges of driving while disqualified and was sentenced in south <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Croydon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Crown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION> on Tuesday to nine months in jail. He was also banned from driving for another year. Prosecutor <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Finnigan </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Proctor </PERSON> was killed in 1982 and <PERSON> Stratton </PERSON> was sent to prison in 1983 for nine months and banned from driving for 4 -LCB- years for causing deaths by reckless driving. He was again disqualified from driving for three years in 1985. <PERSON> Finnigan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Proctor </PERSON> heard <PERSON> Stratton </PERSON> was still driving, and tracked him for several months to gain the evidence he handed over to police. The judge, Sir <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Farquharson </PERSON>, told <PERSON> Stratton </PERSON>: `` What is particularly distressing is that having caused the death of a young boy one would have thought that in those circumstances you would have been particularly careful not to get involved in driving offences again.'' <PERSON> Proctor </PERSON> said <PERSON> Stratton </PERSON> should have got a longer jail term. `` He is clearly a danger on the roads,'' he said after the hearing.

<HEAD>Incidents at O'Hare Raise New Safety Questions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new series of mistakes by air traffic controllers at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> has plagued one of the world's busiest airports, which already is the subject of a federal safety investigation, officials say. Controllers at the airport made one error Sunday and two Friday, bringing the number of recorded errors at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> this year to 29, officials said Tuesday. By comparison, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hartsfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> has had six errors this year, and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s National Airport two. In one incident Friday, two <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> jets came near each other when a controller apparently mistakenly gave one of them an order to descend from 14,000 feet to 11,000 feet, a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. In the day's other incident, an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet and a <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> jet came within 400 feet vertically and a mile horizontally when the pilot of the American apparently failed to repeat an order to reduce speed and the controller did not seek confirmation, the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> reported today. On Sunday, two <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jets came within 500 feet of each other horizontally after the pilot of one plane apparently followed an order intended for the other, the newspaper said. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> requires airplanes in the area to be separated a minimum of three miles horizontally or 1,000 feet vertically. The incidents occurred just two months after the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> issued a report saying that chronic understaffing, mandatory overtime, outdated equipment and inadequate training had contributed to mistakes at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION>. And now <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> officials are worried that the trend has not been reversed, said regional director <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinwiddie </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>, which has 90 days to respond to the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> report, has not yet replied, said an <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Both agencies are investigating the recent errors. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellino </PERSON>, regional representative of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Controllers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION>'s radar room on Friday was `` a zoo.'' With Friday's 3,842 takeoffs and landings _ 11 below the record set the day before _ there should have been 18 journeyman controllers and several `` developmental'' controllers on duty. But <PERSON> Bellino </PERSON> said there were only 14 controllers in both categories, and the problem was made worse when the controllers who made the errors were temporarily relieved of their duties, giving those who remained even more responsibilities. `` We had airplanes all over the sky,'' <PERSON> Bellino </PERSON> said. `` We were buried all day long.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> could not immediately say how many controllers were on duty Friday, but spokesman <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Zochert </PERSON> said the total number of controllers working at the airport has risen from 87 last year to 94 as of Sept. 1. There are now six new developmental controllers and one new journeyman.

<TEXT>
 A story that refers to cruel conduct by a Japanese soldier during World War II was pulled from a high school textbook and replaced with an excerpt from `` My Fair Lady'' after politicians protested to the publisher. <ORGANIZATION> Sanseido </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the publisher of the English textbook, decided to replace the story after members of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> complained that it was inappropriate. But the change has led to renewed charges that political and government influence is being used to gloss over textbook accounts of Japanese atrocities during World War II. The five-page lesson titled `` War'' in Sanseido's `` First English Series II'' begins with a conversation among Southeast Asians. `` ` Which nation is the most cruel?' ` The Germans.' ` No. No. The Japanese,''' the lesson says. The lesson then tells a story about a <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> soldier in <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> who grabbed a baby from its mother and `` threw the baby up into the air and ran his sword through it. The baby died on the spot.'' The lesson goes on to say, `` War makes people cruel. So we can not say one nation is more cruel than another.'' It also mentions the case of Siamese twins from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Duc </PERSON> and Viet, whose deformity may have been caused by the defoliant Agent Orange used by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. `` These stories are sad, but sometimes we have to face uncomfortable things to make our life better,'' the lesson said. <PERSON> Fukuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishinabe </PERSON>, director of Sanseido's school textbook department, said the story was aimed at promoting understanding for international peace. But he said the company agreed to replace the story with an excerpt from `` My Fair Lady,'' the popular musical, because `` any material that causes misunderstanding is not good.'' <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> politicians claimed the story exaggerated Japanese soldiers' cruelty during World War II and lacked historic and scientific background. `` We thought no teacher should use such a textbook as this,'' said <PERSON> Iwao </PERSON> <PERSON> Kudo </PERSON> of the Education Division of the party's <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. The 120-page textbook was approved by <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> examiners in July. All textbooks used in Japanese schools must be approved by the ministry, which often demands changes. Other Asian nations have in recent years protested many of those changes, including changing <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s `` invasion'' of mainland <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> to `` advance'' and the toned-down description of the Nanking Massacre, in which Japanese soldiers killed or raped up to 300,000 Chinese. History texts also fail to mention <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s biological experiments on war prisoners in <LOCATION> Manchuria </LOCATION>. Next year for the first time, one of the 18 approved high school history texts will include <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s chemical warfare activities during the war, the ministry's textbook division said Publishers can not be forced to make changes once a textbook is approved, except to correct errors, but <PERSON> Sanseido </PERSON> agreed to replace its war story, said <PERSON> Hiroyasu </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasegawa </PERSON> of the ministry's textbook division. <PERSON> Shoju </PERSON> <PERSON> Oba </PERSON>, an official of the <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> Teacher's Union, criticized the deletion. `` Authors should be able to publish textbooks with their own choice of materials free of government inspection in the first place,'' he said. `` In this respect, the <ORGANIZATION> LDP </ORGANIZATION>'s claim and the decision of the ministry and the publisher could lead to something very dangerous.'' <PERSON> Mitsu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaneko </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> member of parliament, called on the Education Ministry to restore the story to the text.

<HEAD>NJ Inaugurates Head Start-Funded Center For Children With AIDS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HELEN J. SIMON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 On a rubble-strewn lot in a poor neighborhood, officials dedicated a day care center for children with AIDS that will serve as the model for similar centers elsewhere. `` We think this will be an exemplary project for other cities and counties,'' said <PERSON> Sydney </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>, the assistant secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, who attended the dedication Tuesday. The center is the first in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to operate with federal Head Start and state money. Similar centers will open soon in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> said. `` Poor children with a terrible disease are a very easy constituency to forget,'' said Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON>. `` This center, with its Head Start background, will help children turn trouble into opportunity.'' Ms. <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> said <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> was chosen for the first center in part because of the state's high number of AIDS cases. `` We desperately need this program,'' said state Human Services Commissioner <PERSON> Drew </PERSON> <PERSON> Altman </PERSON>. According to the federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> has the second-highest number of reported cases of children under age 13 with AIDS, 163. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> has the most, 364. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> ranks fifth in the nation with 5,130 reported cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, behind <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>. There are a total of 74,447 cases nationwide, with 1,185 of them among children under 13. AIDS is transmitted through the exchange of bodily fluids, most commonly during intimate sexual contact or the sharing of hypodermic needles. Most children who have the disease contract it in the womb and are born to women who are intravenous drug users. The Head Start center, in a brick building in north-central <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, is the result of efforts by community groups, businesses and local, state and federal governments. It will be operated by <LOCATION> Babyland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nursery </LOCATION>, a neighborhood-based organization that cares for more than 300 children at three centers and has programs for children who are abused or face family violence. The center will open Nov. 5 with 10 children ranging from a few months to 3 years old, and with about six staff members, said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, executive director of Babyland. Head Start is a child development program that provides education, health and social services for low-income children, mainly ages 3 to 5. In addition to child care, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said, the center will aim at educating the community about the need to give children with AIDS the same love as any child. `` These kids will be kissed and hugged and treated in the same fashion as all our other Babyland children,'' she said. She said care-givers will use no special protective wear, since AIDS can not be transmitted through casual contact. `` When we first started this program we thought -LRB- getting AIDS -RRB- would be a real concern,'' she said. `` But actually we had care-givers from our other programs volunteering to do this program. They have so much compassion for these children that they want to work in it.'' The center eventually will serve up to 30 children, who will be referred by state agencies working with AIDS victims. The children will receive daily physical exams and regular treatment from <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospitals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. In the first year of operation, <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> will contribute $ 120,000 in Head Start money to the center; $ 160,000 more will come from the state.

<TEXT>
 There is an upbeat mood in this northern Italian fashion capital, thanks to good weather, good exchange rates at the bank and good clothes on the runway. This optimistic feeling was apparent at Monday evening's black-tie gala at <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>'s famed <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scala </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opera </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in honor of the Italian fashion industry Highlight of the evening was a concert by Italian soprano <PERSON> Katia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricciarelli </PERSON>, who sang arias from <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s rich operatic repertoire. Sitting in the royal box was Prince <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> and his Italian wife, Princess <PERSON> Paola </PERSON>, while the rest of the theater was packed with <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>'s beautiful people from blue-eyed, silver-haired <PERSON> Giorgio </PERSON> <PERSON> Armani </PERSON>, to one of film director <PERSON> Federico </PERSON> <PERSON> Fellini </PERSON>'s favorite actresses, <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Milo </PERSON>. Following the concert, the glitzy crowd gathered in the foyer for a buffet supper, a perfect opportunity to show off their evening finery. The current look is short black velvet cocktail dresses with taffeta pouf skirts, and sheer black embroidered stockings worn with spike heels. However, by next season these outfits will be relegated to the back of the closet to make room for the long, languid skirts and pants that are the hits of the spring-summer 1989 collections being presented this week. The new look is in stark contrast to the short sexy numbers that were displayed at <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scala </LOCATION>. Pale creamy colors, gossamer fabrics, flat shoes and hemlines that graze the ankle make up the spring style. There's nothing controversial about these clothes, which should appeal to trend-setters and conservatives alike. Flamboyant <PERSON> Gianni </PERSON> <PERSON> Versace </PERSON> toned down his tough sexy style, while <ORGANIZATION> Krizia </ORGANIZATION> gave a new softness to her sleek man-tailored suits, and simplified her extravagant evening wear. Even the `` enfants terribles'' <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagerfeld </PERSON> and <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> <PERSON> Moschino </PERSON> succumbed to the new calm mood. The Milan fashion vista is expanding, thanks to <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Biagiotti </PERSON>, who was the first designer to bring Italian clothes to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, when she presented her collection in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in April. Celebrating her historic visit, twenty Chinese models returned the favor by appearing in her Oriental inspired spring collection. Sitting in the front row was the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Dong </PERSON>, and a delegation of Chinese trade officials. There is talk that <PERSON> Biagiotti </PERSON>, a latter day <PERSON> Marco </PERSON> <PERSON> Polo </PERSON>, may produce some of her famed cashmere creations in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.

 The vote approving continued sales of alcohol here was a reaction against pressure from `` drys'' after a bus crash blamed on drunken driving killed 27 people, most of them children, a `` wet'' says. `` This vote is a statement that we're happy with the community we live in,'' <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>, leader of Citizens for the <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION>, said after the referendum Tuesday in northern <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Carroll </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and this county seat. In <LOCATION> Carrollton </LOCATION>, 1,211 voted to continue liquor sales; 450 voted to ban them. Countywide, 1,173 voted for the status quo, and 750 voted against it. `` I'm sorry we did n't win, but we gave the people the opportunity to say what they wanted,'' said <PERSON> Trudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the anti-alcohol Citizens for a Better Life. The referendum was prompted by the fiery May 14 crash of a church bus and a pickup truck, which killed 24 children. The pickup truck driver, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, has been charged with murder, drunken driving and other counts. `` A lot of people took it personally,'' <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said of the accident. `` They felt by voting no, it would be accepting some responsibility for the bus crash. `` The man driving the truck was not even from <LOCATION> Carroll </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. We would have been having to take that rap for him and we were n't ready to do that. About 59 percent of those eligible to vote cast ballots, surpassing the turnout for most presidential elections, said County Clerk <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tilley </PERSON>. `` The voter turnout really pleased me,'' <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said. `` I've said all along the greater the turnout, the greater the margin of victory -LRB- for us -RRB- will be. <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Roeder </PERSON>, a member of Citizens for a Better Life, said earlier Tuesday that the referendum had been desired for many years. `` The bus crash probably did prompt people into action, whereas before they thought, ` What's the sense?''' she said.

 Afghan guerrillas fired rockets into <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> today during morning rush hour, killing 11 people and injuring 26 others in the capital city, the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. Also today, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> reiterated Soviet complaints that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is to blame for violations of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> accord providing for the withdrawal of Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` All indications are that in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, they have a very flawed idea of international law, state-to-state relations and treaty-based commitments,'' the newspaper said. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> said last week it had halted the withdrawal of its troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, citing violations of the accord. Pravda said the Afghan government has registered more than 1,500 violations of the accord with <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> monitors. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said 23 rockets were fired from positions northwest of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> during morning rush hour. It said 11 people died and 26 others were wounded. Under the accord signed April 14, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> agreed to withdraw its 100,000 soldiers from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in exchange for a pledge of non-interference by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and other countries that have been aiding the guerrillas.

<HEAD>Leftist Terror Group Grapo Says It Killed Madrid Policeman</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The tiny leftist terror group <ORGANIZATION> GRAPO </ORGANIZATION> has claimed responsibility for slaying a national police officer, a radio network reported today. The private network SER said it received an anonymous telephone call Tuesday night in which a man claimed the killing on behalf of the extreme-left terror group, the 1st of October Anti-fascist <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, known by its Spanish acronym <ORGANIZATION> GRAPO </ORGANIZATION>. Two men and a woman took part in the killing early Tuesday in which one man shot to death a 47-year-old policeman who had been on duty at an identity card office, police said. The man also slightly injured another police officer and a man and a woman during the shooting, police said. Police said <ORGANIZATION> GRAPO </ORGANIZATION> was particularly active in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> in 1976-77 when they claimed the killings of 12 policeman and more than 30 terrorist attacks including bombings, shootings and kidnappings. Most <ORGANIZATION> GRAPO </ORGANIZATION> members were jailed in the late 1970s and early 1980s, police said. Interior Minister <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Corcuera </PERSON> told reporters Tuesday that the <ORGANIZATION> GRAPO </ORGANIZATION> unit that killed the policeman was made up of two men and two women. Eyewitnesses positively identified three of them in police pictures as <PERSON> Laureano </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, <PERSON> Encarnacion </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lara </PERSON> and <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON>.

Police have sought <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> and the two women since they were identified as having been involved in the May 27 shooting death of a businessman in the northwestern port city of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coruna </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> GRAPO </ORGANIZATION> group claimed responsibility for that shooting a few days later in a letter to a newspaper in the southeastern city of <LOCATION> Valencia </LOCATION>, police said. The three are also wanted for other attacks. <PERSON> Corcuera </PERSON> said the four-person <ORGANIZATION> GRAPO </ORGANIZATION> unit was the sole remaining active component of the group.

<TEXT>
 Officials in several <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> countries breathed a sigh of relief today after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> failed to override a veto of limits on textile imports, but they fretted over <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> protectionist sentiment that gave rise to the bill. `` The textile bill is dead,'' trumpeted <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s director of trade, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sze </PERSON>. But, he added, `` the textile lobby is not going to give up. It will be looking for ways to make protection for the textiles industry more palatable to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> legislators. This could seriously threaten <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s trading interests.'' In the latest statistics available in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, the British colony exported $ 3.4 billion worth of clothing and accessories and $ 116 million worth of textile fabrics to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1986. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 272-152 in favor of overriding President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto of the bill. The tally fell 11 votes short of the two-thirds majority needed to override the veto and impose the restrictions. The bill would have frozen 1988 textile and apparel imports at last year's level and limited growth to 1 percent annually beginning in 1989. It also would have capped imports of non-rubber footwear with no provision for future increases. <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> countries that sell billions of dollars worth of textiles and clothing to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had expressed alarm as the bill moved through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, criticizing it as protectionist and unwarranted. `` Our concern has been resolved as the effort by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to override the presidential veto has failed,'' <PERSON> Mitsuaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayashi </PERSON>, a spokesman for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION>, said today. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> exported $ 118 million worth of textiles to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1987, and the ministry had said earlier the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> legislation violated international trade agreements and would hurt future accords. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> also said it welcomed the `` anti-protectionist efforts made by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his administration.'' But a ministry statement also noted that nearly two-thirds of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had voted for a bill that `` contains very restrictive and discriminatory articles that are not compatible with free trade.'' In <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s deputy spokesman, <PERSON> Prachyadavi </PERSON> <PERSON> Tavedikul </PERSON>, said both Americans and Thais would benefit from the upheld veto. `` We favor free trade. Our people and Americans will gain from lower textile prices,'' <PERSON> Tavedikul </PERSON> said.

 A prosecutor will look at statements made by Solidarity national spokesman <PERSON> Janusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON> at a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressional hearing last month to see if any Polish law was violated, the government has said. Government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> said Tuesday that is was `` peculiar'' for a Polish citizen to appear before a foreign government and give testimony about affairs in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, but he did not know if any laws were violated. The Foreign Ministry planned to establish the facts of the testimony and a prosecutor will examine the statements for possible legal violations, Urban said at his weekly news conference. <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON>, a mathematics instructor at <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> who has been Solidarity's spokesman since 1981, returned to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> on Sunday after a trip to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He was received there by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and appeared before a congressional hearing on Sept. 23. During the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> visit, <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON> urged continued <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> pressure on <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> to bring about legal recognition of Solidarity, the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc's first independent trade unon which was banned in 1981 after the imposition of martial law. <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Nowak </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Polish-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, an organization of Americans of Polish descent, testified before a congressional committee about human rights in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and treatment of Poles elsewhere, including the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The appearance before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON> was the subject of criticism in the government-controlled press, which said he was appearing as a employee reporting to his employer. Polish officials frequently criticize <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support of Solidarity over the past several years, saying it makes the banned union an agent of a foreign power.

<HEAD>Party Leader Announces Leadership Shakeup</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Stipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON> has announced a plan to overhaul the party leadership, perhaps replacing up to one-third of the 165-member Central Committee. <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Sarajevo </LOCATION> television Tuesday night that the ruling Presidium would propose the changes to the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which is to hold a crucial session on Oct. 17. `` Very soon new people will be brought into the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communists </ORGANIZATION> and its presidium,'' <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON> said, according to a dispatch from the official <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency. He said at the forthcoming meeting the party Presidium `` will strive ... to determine the criteria of possible responsibility of its members'' for <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s economic and political crisis. `` If it fails in this, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> will assume this role and anyone who does not win two-thirds of votes of the membership of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> will leave this body,'' the party chief declared. He added 43 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the presidium so far have been charged with lack of responsibility. The replacement of one-third of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is the maximum permitted by the party statute, except at a party congress. The party presidium has 23 members. Suvar announced that a similar overhaul was expected in the party leaderships of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s six republics and two autonomous provinces. There have been increasing calls for top-level personnel changes in the party leadership. Leaders have been blamed for failing to stop ethnic tensions between ethnic Albanians and Slavs in the restive <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> province and the deteriotating economic and political situation. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> is burdened with a 217 percent annual inflation, a 15 percent unemployment rate and a $ 21 billion foreign debt. On Tuesday, about 5,000 workers from the <LOCATION> Rakovica </LOCATION> industrial suburb of <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> marched on <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, protesting low wages and sagging living standards. Several hundred women did the same this morning, protesting low standards of living.

 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> said today it is trying to determine the fate of two Americans arrested after they tried to advertise a $ 2.4 million reward for the return of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers in <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION>. An embassy spokesman, contacted by telephone in <LOCATION> Vientiane </LOCATION>, said the embassy received no response to a note sent to the Laotian Foreign Ministry asking about the status of the Americans, who were seized by authorities Sunday. <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, 45, and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Copp </PERSON>, 43, had planned to float thousands of dollars down the <LOCATION> Mekong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> offering the reward to any Laotian, <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> or Vietnamese who brought an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> prisoner of war to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. The two had also planned to cross to the <LOCATION> Laotian </LOCATION> bank of the boundary-marking river and advertise the award to local villagers. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Petzing </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, said Tuesday the two were being held at Ban Sing <PERSON> Samphan </PERSON> in the southern <LOCATION> Laotian </LOCATION> province of <LOCATION> Champasak </LOCATION>. He could not confirm whether they were still in the village today or had been moved. Long, of <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, has described herself as an MIA-POW activist and revealed her plan Sunday to The Associated Press before making the trip to the river. She was traveling with <PERSON> Copp </PERSON>, a schoolteacher and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war veteran from <LOCATION> Hampstead </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pornthipa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vajarabukka </LOCATION>, a Thai hotel manager who visited the Americans in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> Tuesday, said she saw them but was not allowed to speak to them. She said they were being held in a small house in the village. She said authorities had told her Monday that the two would be released within three days, but Tuesday refused to say when they would be freed. <PERSON> Pornthipa </PERSON> said the hotel management felt responsible for the two because they had made contact with the hotel before making the trip on the river in a rented boat. The Americans speak neither Thai or Lao and have limited knowledge of the area. The two carried $ 3,000 in single bills as well as some Russian and Indonesian currency. Bills were stamped in red with the reward offer and placed in plastic packets. The <LOCATION> Mekong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> forms a boundary with <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and then flows on to both <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. The reward money is being offered through the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> War </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION>, a private MIA-POW group. The group says the money has been pledged by 21 Congressmen and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, another group concerned with the MIA issue. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government lists 2,393 Americans as missing in action from the <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION> war in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. The three Indochinese governments deny holding any live Americans.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> `` Buddy'' <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON> said after winning the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> runoff that he would try to heal wounds from the divisive race while looking ahead to a `` mainstream versus extreme'' contest with Republican <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>. <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON> said he would meet in <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION> today with state Insurance Commissioner <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunter </PERSON>, the defeated <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate who pledged to support <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON> less than a week after accusing the third-term congressman of running the nastiest campaign in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> history. Unofficial returns from Tuesday's runoff gave MacKay 362,234, or 52 percent of the vote, to <PERSON> Gunter </PERSON>'s 330,297, or 48 percent. <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, a former Cape Coral bank president and grandson of the baseball Hall of Fame manager, is a well-funded conservative whose candidacy is drawing national Republican help. <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> and <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON> will face each other on the November ballot for the seat held by Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>, who is retiring after three terms. `` We are the candidacy that can beat <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON> said Tuesday night. `` I see this election as mainstream versus extreme.'' <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> agreed that voters faced an ideological decision. `` I think the voters in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> are going to have a very clear choice between the liberal <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON> and the conservative <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> runoff climaxed twisting events that began last December, when <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>, 58, announced he would n't seek re-election, saying he was burned out by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and did n't like the high cost of running for re-election. Popular former two-term Gov. <PERSON> Reubin </PERSON> <PERSON> Askew </PERSON> then entered the race against <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Askew </PERSON>, well ahead in all polls, withdrew May 7, saying he did n't like all the time spent raising funds. <PERSON> Gunter </PERSON> and MacKay jumped in after <PERSON> Askew </PERSON> pulled out, and they ran one-two in the Sept. 6 primary. But neither received a majority, making a runoff necessary. <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON>, a lawyer from a wealthy landowning family, was endorsed by <PERSON> Askew </PERSON>, 1986 Democratic gubernatorial nominee <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Pajcic </PERSON>, third-place primary finisher Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mica </PERSON> and fourth-place finisher state Sen. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>. The runoff campaign was filled with negative advertising and sharp exchanges in debates, and Democratic officials worried that <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> would face a crippled opponent in the general election. <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON>, 55, attacked <PERSON> Gunter </PERSON>'s integrity for his practice each election of using campaign contributions from the insurance industry he regulates, including from two companies that later collapsed in corruption. He also charged that <PERSON> Gunter </PERSON> voted against desegregation 15 years ago. <PERSON> Gunter </PERSON>, 54, charged that <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON>'s congressional record betrayed <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, Social Security and anti-drug efforts, and he claimed <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON> was being supported by corrupt defense contractors. <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON> warned that the well-funded <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> could exploit <PERSON> Gunter </PERSON>'s alleged ethics problems <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, meanwhile, went on the attack against <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON>, running television and newspaper ads charging: `` Hey Buddy, You're liberal!'' <PERSON> Gunter </PERSON> lost a 1974 Democratic <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> runoff and won a 1980 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> runoff only to lose in the general election.

<TEXT>
 The leader of two military coups last year was given a promotion in the army today as this <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> nation approached its first anniversary as a republic. <PERSON> Sitiveni </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabuka </PERSON> was third in the army hierachy and a lieutenant colonel when he staged his first coup May 14, 1987. He mounted a second takeover four months later and then elevated himself to the rank of brigadier-general. Friday marks the first anniversary of his declaration that <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION>, a former British colony and once a staunch member of the <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION>, had severed its ties with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to become a republic. To mark the event, President <PERSON> Ratu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sir </PERSON> <PERSON> Penaia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ganilau </PERSON> announced today that <PERSON> Rabuka </PERSON> now holds the rank of major-general. <PERSON> Ganilau </PERSON> was the country's former governor-general, and as such official representative of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> 11. There was no immediate explanation for the promotion. <PERSON> Ganilau </PERSON> had opposed <PERSON> Rabuka </PERSON>'s aim to change the constitution to give preference to ethnic Melanesian Fijians in a future parliament over the Indian community, which has a majority in the 715,000 population. Indigenous Fijians account for 47 percent while Indians, descendants of indentured sugar plantation laborers, comprise 49 percent. <PERSON> Rabuka </PERSON> staged the coups following weeks of civil unrest against Indian businesses that is widely believed to have been instigated by an extremist Fijian group. <PERSON> Rabuka </PERSON> remains chief of the army and head of the home affairs ministry, a powerful position because it puts him in charge of security. <PERSON> Rabuka </PERSON>, 40, staged his first coup and overthrew the multi-racial, Indian-domination government of <PERSON> Timoci </PERSON> <PERSON> Bavadra </PERSON>, just one month after <PERSON> Bavadra </PERSON> was elected in free elections. Four months later, <PERSON> Rabuka </PERSON> carried out a second coup against an interim government. <PERSON> Rabuka </PERSON> since has handed power to a nominally civilian government.

 Police were searching for a young drifter believed to be the gunman who shot into an elementary school playground and wounded a third-grade student before disappearing into the woods. `` We know who the suspect is, but we do n't know the motive,'' <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Noel </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said Tuesday as officers chopped weeds and cleared brush near <LOCATION> Mascotte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elementary </LOCATION> in their search for the rifle used in the shooting of 9-year-old <PERSON> Leah </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilibanks </PERSON>. The bearded man who fired on the approximately 25 children in the schoolyard Monday wore military-style camouflage clothes and a punk haircut, shaved on the sides and sticking straight up in the center, investigators said. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> would n't say how the gunman was identified but did say he was not a local resident. The child was listed in serious condition at <ORGANIZATION> Orlando </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. She was hit by a single bullet that passed through the upper right arm and chest, officials said. Her grandmother, <PERSON> Dolly </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, said the girl asked late Monday: `` Why would somebody shoot me?'' <ORGANIZATION> Mascotte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Page </PERSON> said, `` We do n't exactly know the motive of why anybody would shoot a young child like that.'' Deputies were stationed at all elementary and grade schools in this community of 1,600. Although scores of officers and residents had joined in the search Monday, only a few officers were left searching for the suspect by late Tuesday. The sheriff discouraged civilians from trying to take the law into their own hands. `` They should watch their kids ... and leave it to us,'' he said. Children in <PERSON> Mascotte </PERSON> and the surrounding towns of <LOCATION> Groveland </LOCATION>, Minneola and <LOCATION> Clermont </LOCATION> would not be allowed on playgrounds for a few days, said <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> Superintendent <PERSON> Freddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Garner </PERSON>. Police were on hand to stand guard when the elementary school reopened Tuesday, and counselors were brought in to talk to the children. Doors to all schools in the district were locked, and all principals were instructed to take extra precautions. <ORGANIZATION> Mascotte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> reported more than 150 children absent Tuesday, out of an enrollment of about 415. Normal absenteeism is about 20.

 A helicopter taking experts to check flood damage in this city crashed, killing the pilot and a passenger, authorities said today. The accident raised the flood's death toll to 10.

False assumptions and communications problems caused the mistake, said <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lesterlin </PERSON>, deputy prefect in the region.

 Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> received two more blood transfusions today, and doctors kept a close watch on the 87-year-old monarch as his fever worsened, palace officials said. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> vomited blood Sept. 19 and has continued to discharge a small amount of blood intermittently. He has received transfusions totaling 11 -LCB- pints of blood. <PERSON> Kenji </PERSON> <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON>, head of general affairs at the <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Household </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said doctors gave the emperor 0.23 pints of blood after a transfusion of 0.4 pints earlier today. <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON> said doctors gave him a smaller amount the second time because too much blood might strain his heart. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s temperature continued to climb steadily in the evening and reached 100.94 degrees. His normal temperature is about 95.9. His pulse was 104, up from 81 in the morning. The emperor has not been able to consume any solid food except a few spoonfuls of porridge since falling sick. He is being fed intravenously. Besides whole blood, palace physicians this week began administering platelets to the emperor. They also sought to increase intravenous nutrients, including glucose and protein, news reports said.

 A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver beaten and slain aboard a hijacked <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jetliner said he hoped the hijackers would kill him instead of his married <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> comrades, a witness testified today. Diver <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> made the remark after two Shiite Moslem air pirates beat him so savagely he was in shock, said <PERSON> Rosemarie </PERSON> <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>, a passenger aboard Flight 847. `` The young man -LRB- <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> -RRB- was crying. He was unable to walk by himself,'' said <PERSON> Mrs. </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>, an Australian who was traveling with her husband and daughter. She said <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> led <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> down the airplane's aisle, told her husband to get out of his seat and put <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> next to her <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> is on trial on charges of murder and air piracy in the June 1985 hijacking of the Athens-to-Rome flight in which <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> was killed and 39 Americans were held captive for 17 days. Mrs. <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>, 52, said she later switched seats with her daughter and that her daughter talked to <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> at length. `` He said to her that if anyone would have to be killed, he hoped it would be him, because the others -LRB- the five fellow divers -RRB- were all married,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> said, her voice breaking with emotion. `` He was in shock. He also had a bandage around his neck. It had blood on it,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> said. `` He said he thought his knee was broken. He told her he had been tied up and that when they finished beating him he was hit over the head with the pistol.'' `` He was shaking,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> said. `` He said some of his ribs were broken.'' Motioning with her hands, Mrs. <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> kept rubbing an injured hand. `` He said he had no feeling -LRB- in it -RRB-,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> said. After the plane landed in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>, 23, of <LOCATION> Waldorf </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, was shot and pushed out of the plane. He died on the airport tarmac. In testimony Tuesday, an American held during the hijacking testified that <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> appeared proud of <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>'s slaying. `` He looked like the fox that got the chicken. He showed absolutely no remorse,'' said <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Dahl </PERSON>, a 34-year-old <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver. <PERSON> Dahl </PERSON> also said he believed <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was the hijacker who shot <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>. Shaking his finger and pointing directly at <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, he said: `` I know he was the one that hit me on the back of the head. Although I did not see him ... I would say he was the one who did it -LRB- shot <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> -RRB-.'' <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was arrested at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in January 1987 after customs officials found liquid explosives in his luggage. His trial began July 5 and is expected to last until December. <PERSON> Dahl </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> supervisor, said that `` immediately, not more than a minute after the shooting,'' <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> came to where he was sitting in the airplane and hit him on the back of the head with the butt of the gun. `` He was very proud of his power; he was very proud of what he had done,'' said <PERSON> Dahl </PERSON>. Witnesses have given conflicting testimony about who fired the shot that killed <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dahl </PERSON>'s testimony echoed that of pilot <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Testrake </PERSON>, who said he believed <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was the gunman. Other witnesses said they thought another hijacker shot him. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> has admitted being one of the hijackers but has denied killing <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>. A third diver, 30-year-old <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, testified Tuesday that <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> shoved a cocked pistol at his face and seemed ready to shoot before a flight attendant begged him to stop. `` He had a chrome-plated automatic pistol in his hand. He pointed it directly in my face and pulled back the hammer.'' `` I was very afraid I would be shot,'' <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Man Faces Trial in February Takeover of Tuscaloosa School</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A man who faces 110 counts of kidnapping in the 12-hour takeover of a private school last February was granted the right to defend himself after promising the judge he would n't disrupt his trial. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> made the promise to Circuit Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Karrh </PERSON> at a pre-trial hearing Monday. Jury selection was to begin this afternoon. <PERSON> Karrh </PERSON>, in granting <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>'s request to represent himself, warned that the defendant would be taken from the courtroom if he shows any `` disruptive or obstreperous behavior.'' The judge also told <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> he would not allow any statements not related to the kidnapping charges. `` You wo n't have any problem out of me, I promise you that,'' said <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>, 43, of <LOCATION> Tuscaloosa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> is accused in connection with the Feb. 2 takeover of <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> End </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tuscaloosa </LOCATION>. Armed with two pistols and a rifle and wearing ski masks, <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> and another man entered the school and held 110 students and teachers hostage, saying he was trying to draw attention to the nation's homeless and hungry. No one was injured in the incident, which ended 12 hours later with <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>'s surrender on viewing a bogus pardon videotaped by Gov. Guy Hunt. Charges were later dropped against the other man, who police said was forced to participate in the takeover. The governor is one of 137 witnesses <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> has subpoenaed. <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>'s assistant press secretary, <PERSON> Stacy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rimer </PERSON>, said he would testify. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> has been held in lieu of $ 8.4 million bond since Feb. 2. If convicted, he could be sentenced to more than 10,000 years in prison. `` I would never do anything to hurt anybody,'' <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Tuscaloosa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone call from the county jail Monday. `` It is not inside of me.'' He said any of his student hostages could have left `` any time they wanted to walk out.'' `` All I wanted to do,'' <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> said, `` was help the many oppressed people in pain and suffering in bondage and the many starving people in my country. I do again beg forgiveness from these children, teachers, parents and every citizen.'' Because of publicity in <LOCATION> Tuscaloosa </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Karrh </PERSON> moved the trial to <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>, about 160 miles away.

Nothing was stolen, and the attack lasted less than two minutes, said Detective Sgt. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` Obviously, somebody hired these guys,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` They went in, did their thing and got out.'' Among the leads police are checking is a failed real estate deal, involving a downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> building, that forced <PERSON> Luby </PERSON> and his estranged wife, <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON>, into bankruptcy. <PERSON> Luby </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> executive, told police the attackers asked him if he was <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Luby </PERSON>, <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> said.

Ms. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> said Tuesday that one of the attackers said: `` You're messing with the wrong guy Next time, we'll kill you.'' <PERSON> Luby </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON>, whose hands and feet were bound behind them, were found by <PERSON> Luby </PERSON>'s houseboy, who freed them and called police.

<HEAD>Reagan Authorized Free Hand for CIA on Counterterrorism</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed intelligence authorizations in 1984 and 1985 giving <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agents broad anti-terrorism powers that some administration officials saw as `` a license to kill,'' according to a published report. The authorizations `` deemed'' as lawful any covert actions _ including potentially violent ones _ taken in `` good faith'' by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence agents against terrorists, according to a report in today's editions of The Washington Post. The language of the findings seemingly was ambiguous, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. Actions taken in good faith and as part of an approved operation would be deemed lawful in advance, but also they `` must be'' lawful, sources told the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. The newspaper quoted a former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> official, whom it did not identify, as saying the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> orders were a `` go-anywhere, do-anything'' authority. The language of the findings caused disputes among administration officials, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said, because actions that could be authorized under the findings might conflict with earlier presidential executive orders banning any direct or indirect involvement of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence agents in assassinations. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> quoted a source as saying the language was specifically designed to `` circumvent the assassination ban'' and protect <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agents who might take part in foreign strike teams. White House spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> he knew nothing about the findings late Tuesday night. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported that unidentified White House officials said Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would have been given a copy of or would have had access to the findings. A <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokesman and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, who was White House chief of staff at the time <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed the 1984 finding, had no comment, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed the first finding on Nov. 13, 1984, shortly after his landslide reelection victory, the report said, because <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials had become frustrated with car-bombings at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> facilities and the taking of American hostages. Congressional intelligence committees were not informed of the crucial language in the findings, the report said. The authorization was rescinded on April 10, 1985, a month after a car bomb exploded, killing 80 people in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> near the residence of a leader of one faction of Iranian fundamentalists. The second authorization which included similar language was signed by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Aug. 11, 1985, two months after the highjacking of <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> Flight 847 in which <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> was killed. The intelligence panels were briefed after the signing of the second finding, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said.

<TEXT>
 U.S-Vietnamese teams investigating the fates of American airmen shot down on bombing missions found two sets of human remains and the possible site of other remains, officials said today. `` We found partial human remains at two different locations,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, leader of the six <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military experts. `` Neither <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nor Vietnamese forensic experts have had access to them at this point. The Vietnamese have pledged to immediately repatriate any remains so we expect to receive them in the near future.'' The two teams of experts found the remains and pieces of aircraft wreckage in an eight-day search of areas in five provinces around <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>. In the search, which ended Tuesday, the investigators interviewed villagers and inspected sites were planes crashed during the Vietnam War. The teams focused on trying to determine what happened to six airmen shot down during bombing missions from 1965 to 1967, said <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Can </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s Office For Seeking Missing Personnel. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said some of the six men were believed to have survived, although there was no evidence they are still alive. Villagers led investigators to remains in <LOCATION> Lang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Son </LOCATION> and Ha Nam Ninh provinces, said Can. He said the chances of identifying the remains was improved because teeth were found. The remains will be sent to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after Vietnamese experts examine them. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investigators said the remains at <LOCATION> Lang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Son </LOCATION> were found in a graveyard, but they doubted the body was that of an American. They also reported visiting sites in Ha Nam Ninh and <PERSON> Ha </PERSON> <PERSON> Bac </PERSON> provinces that villagers said contained remains of Americans. The Americans left <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> today for <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, but were to return Friday to review their findings and possibly discuss additional joint work including excavations of the crash sites. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Co </PERSON> <PERSON> Thach </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> said Tuesday his government agreed in principle to many more joint investigations over the next two months to resolve the 70 `` discrepancy cases'' _ including the six airmen _ that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> considers top priority. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> says there is evidence Vietnamese authorities should have information on these cases, which include airmen who were captured but never returned after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces withdrew from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in 1973. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for years urged joint investigations, but <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> previously allowed only one previous joint field project, the 1985 excavation of a crash site outside <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government lists 2,393 Americans as missing in action from the <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION> war in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. The three Indochinese governments deny holding any live Americans.

About 2,000 of the workers entered the building, protesting that they had been locked inside their factory and prevented from joining fellow workers in a protest march on Parliament on Tuesday. `` We have been betrayed!'' and `` We were locked up!'' they chanted as they rushed in. <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>, who is hailed by supporters as the political heir to the late <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Josip </PERSON> <PERSON> Broz </PERSON> <PERSON> Tito </PERSON>, told them: `` You should have trust that we shall carry out our reforms. The moment you lose the trust, you should replace us.'' The <LOCATION> Rakovica </LOCATION> workers _ who earn about $ 100 a month, or two-thirds of the national average _ are part of the growing national unrest in the face of a government austerity program introduced in May that resulted in huge price rises and wage cuts. Today's protest ended peacefully, with the workers leaving after speaking to <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>, said witnesses, who requested anonymity. On Tuesday, a cordon of policemen held back another angry crowd of 5,000 workers from the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> building as they chanted demands for Premier <PERSON> Branko </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikulic </PERSON> and his government to resign. The workers jeered at Deputy Premier <PERSON> Milos </PERSON> <PERSON> Milosavljevic </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Dusan </PERSON> <PERSON> Popovski </PERSON>, who has said he may resign. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> is facing increasing labor and social unrest in the worst economic crisis in its postwar history. The foreign debt is $ 21 billion, unemployment is at least 15 percent and the official inflation rate has reached 217 percent. However, it is widely believed the inflation rate is actually higher. Two top <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders resigned last week from the 23-member ruling Presidium in reaction to mass rallies organized by <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> supporters in <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, the largest of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s six republics. <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Stipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON> announced Tuesday that up to one-third of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> may be replaced at a key meeting Oct. 17, where a major shakedown is expected over the party's failure to manage the economic, ethnic and political tensions in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> Party leaders also have been blamed for failing to stop tensions in the autonomous region of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> between ethnic Albanians, who are Moslems, and the Christian Slavs.

 College students tested the stage and power saws whined in the background as workers transformed a sports arena into a giant television studio for tonight's debate between <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. Organizers proclaimed the hall ready for business, awaiting only minor adjustments after the two vice presidential candidates make personal visits today. `` Everything is coming together beautifully here,'' said <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Bipartisan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Presidential Debates. `` We're a little ahead of schedule on the tasks that have to be performed.'' The 10,000-seat <ORGANIZATION> Omaha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auditorium </ORGANIZATION> underwent a radical facelift in the days following a professional wrestling match on Sunday, sprouting network anchor booths, hundreds of yards of patriotic bunting and miles of electrical cable snaking throughout. The auditorium has been reconfigured to seat 2,000 _ of which only 100 seats are available to the public. It even sported a red-carpeted `` spin valley'' where Democrats and Republicans were to be herded after the debate to present their side of the debate to reporters. `` We're attempting to turn a sports arena into a theater. We're also creating what is in effect a television studio,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Fouhy </PERSON>, producer of the event `` We think we've got this hall turned into what we want, and that is a debate hall.'' As workers completed their tasks, organizers brought in college students to play the role of debaters and panelists so technicians could perfect their camera angles. Some final details awaited the visits of the two candidates. Each has an hour to tour the hall and test such items as the lecterns, which were set at 48 inches high for both. An agreement between the two campaigns allows the lecterns to be lowered up to three inches so the two candidates would appear the same height on television. With <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> standing a couple of inches over six feet and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> close at roughly six feet, little adjustment is likely, <PERSON> Fouhy </PERSON> said. Many officials downplayed the arena's transformation, saying the vice presidential debate was just one more show. `` We do this every day of the year,'' said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Forsberg </PERSON>, building manager. `` It's not even as massive as some of the concerts we do. We're used to it.'' The centerpiece _ the stage setting _ will be a familiar one to millions of American television viewers. It's the same stage that was used for last month's debate between presidential contenders <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> Workers turned the auditorium into a patriotic showcase, with 400 feet of blue carpet and 100 feet of red and white rope and _ for the human touch _ plants described as `` living green.'' The preparations were halted temporarily Tuesday afternoon when a transformer failure darkened half the building and cut power to a fleet of television trucks parked outside. It was repaired quickly. Officials wired in about 500 telephone lines, and had to go searching for extra electricity for the legion of television satellite trucks already dotting the streets outside the auditorium. `` When you add the television city outside, we had to bring in extra power,'' <PERSON> Forsberg </PERSON> said. But after the effort, officials were confident their handiwork was ready. `` We've made it,'' <PERSON> Forsberg </PERSON> said. `` We made it with plenty of time to spare.'' `` We made it, actually, about two hours early,'' <PERSON> Fouhy </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> city officials were putting their best feet forward, clearing parking garages around the auditorium for reporters and debate organizers and starting up a bus shuttle from the airport to downtown. Their zealousness drew fire from advocates for the homeless, who charged they were clearing the homeless out of downtown to avoid embarrassment. City officials rejected the charges.

 The state's mental health commissioner has ordered an inquiry into his department's handling of the case of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, the man accused in the <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON> school shooting spree last week that killed two children. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bevilacqua </PERSON> said Tuesday he could not yet assess whether the mental health department made errors in not committing <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, 19, for treatment before his deadly visit to <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> on Sept. 26. Two children died, and nine people, including two teachers, were wounded. `` I, of course, have concerns where you have a situation of the magnitude of this case in regard to the disruption of the community and the lives that have been involved,'' <PERSON> Bevilacqua </PERSON> said. He said a panel of outside experts and people from within the department will review <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s files and interview people involved in the case. `` We're not blaming anyone,'' <PERSON> Bevilacqua </PERSON> said. `` We're trying to get an assessment of what happened in a very difficult situation. And if we should make corrective actions, we will, in fact, make the corrective action.'' The department twice since 1986 had rejected attempts by <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s relatives to have him involuntary committed to a state facility, according to a retired probate judge who had been involved in the attempts. The former judge, <PERSON> Rosemary </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Trakas </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greenville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s family twice filed affidavits seeking his commitment since 1986. She said he was evaluated on both occasions by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Beckman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Greenwood </LOCATION>, and that the petitions were rejected. She said <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> had been involuntarily committed to the <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> for a period `` of just a few months'' in 1983. He is back in that hospital now, undergoing a psyciatric examination ordered by a court after the shootings. Dr. <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Moseley </PERSON> of <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON>, a private psychiatrist who had treated <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> checked himself into the mental health unit at <ORGANIZATION> Self </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Greenwood </LOCATION> for 15 days about six months ago. He said after that <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, described by his family as hyperactive, reclusive and fascinated with multiple killers, was referred to the <PERSON> Beckman </PERSON> center, but that he never went there for treatment. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, said his son was no longer covered by the family insurance policy when he turned 19 in April and that private psychiatric care was too expensive.

 <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> crews today prepared Discovery for its piggyback ride atop a jet to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and repaired minor damage suffered in the space shuttle's 65 orbits of <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. `` The crews are working, and they will work round the clock until the orbiter leaves'' Saturday, said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayers </PERSON>, deputy site manager for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Dryden </PERSON> Flight Research Facility here The spacecraft, which landed here Monday, had six heat-shield tiles gouged by debris, apparently during liftoff, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Talone </PERSON>, shuttle processing director. Workers also found some `` dings'' to a few of the hundreds of tiles that coat the shuttle, but detected no damage to the orbiter's brakes, landing gear or tires, <PERSON> Talone </PERSON> said. Discovery sat inside the 100-foot-tall `` mate-demate device,'' a shuttle garage where it is being serviced before its trip aboard a jet Saturday to its <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> launch site. Workers must deactivate fuel cells, photograph tile damage and replace gouged tiles, purge main engines and orbital maneuvering engines, and attach locks to prevent control flaps from fluttering during the piggyback flight. Discovery's mission was <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s first manned space mission since the Challenger tragedy in January 1986 that killed seven crew members. `` The vehicle looks beautiful,'' <PERSON> Talone </PERSON> said during a news conference Tuesday. `` It looks probably as good or better as any vehicle we've brought in here.'' Six tiles near the right wing must be replaced because of a 12-inch-long, 6-inch-wide, 1 -LCB- - inch-deep gouge apparently caused by debris during the shuttle's launch Thursday, <PERSON> Talone </PERSON> said <PERSON> Talone </PERSON> said officials were n't yet sure if the debris was ice that formed on the outside of the shuttle's external tank, which contains supercold fuel. `` There's a minor number of traditional dings'' on some other tiles, caused by the impact of tiny particles during liftoff and landing, he added. After preliminary inspection found no damage, the shuttle's brakes were shipped to <PERSON> B.F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodrich </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> for a closer look, he said The brakes were improved because of brake and tire damage during previous missions. <PERSON> Talone </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> workers have n't identified the cause of the trouble with <ORGANIZATION> Discovery </ORGANIZATION>'s flash evaporators _ a problem that made the astronauts endure temperatures in the 80s during their flight. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> plans for Discovery to depart <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> early Saturday, arriving at Kennedy Space Center in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> before dark following a single stop near <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Talone </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 A small group of top officials today attended a low-key military parade, the first since President <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> was assassinated, to mark the 15th anniversary of the 1973 Middle East War. <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> was killed at a much more elaborate anniversary parade on Oct. 6, 1981. President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>, government ministers and a select group of diplomats were the only spectators allowed inside the high walls of the <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> for today's two-hour parade, broadcast live on television and radio. The government did not say why it held the parade a day earlier than the anniversary of the war's start. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> considers its crossing of the <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> on Oct. 6, 1973, and capture of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> positions on the western side as its finest modern-day military accomplishment. The government also did not say why it resumed the military parade, an annual tradition under <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>. It was suspended after Moslem extremists killed the president and seven other people. Under <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>, the parades were held on one of <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>'s largest streets. The day he died, he wore a white, high-booted uniform with gold braid. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>, commander of the air force before <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> chose him as vice president, stood beside him in uniform. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> has not worn his uniform in public since that day. Today, he wore a dark blue suit and mirrored sunglasses. In <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>'s parades, hundreds of gleaming tanks and armored personnel carriers filled the streets and jet fighter-bombers gave spectacular aerial shows. Today, trailers carrying tanks passed the elevated presidential box one at a time. A handful of helicopters with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s flag dangling from them flew overhead for a while, and 15 parachutists landed on the wide parade grounds. The parade was mainly a show of the weapons that <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> used in the 1973 war, called the Yom Kippur War in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the 10th of Ramadan War in the Arab world. In a brief videotaped address, <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> said <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> was a brave hero who decided to make war and won, then decided to make peace. <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> and former Israeli Prime Minister <PERSON> Menachem </PERSON> <PERSON> Begin </PERSON>, spurred by President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, signed the Camp David accord in 1979. It is still the only peace agreement between an Arab country and the Jewish state.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> today branded Rabbi <PERSON> Meir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON>'s anti-Arab Kach party racist and anti-democratic and barred it from competing in the Nov. 1 election. `` It was a political lynching,'' <ORGANIZATION> Kach </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Rahamim </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON> vowed to appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The committee's head, <PERSON> Eliezer </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, said: `` The request for the barring of Kach has been accepted. It is still subject to judicial review.'' In 1984, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> overturned a similar committee decision that would have barred Kach from competing in parliamentary elections that year. Since then, <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> has passed a bill banning racism from political activity. `` In 1984, we did n't have an anti-racist law. Today we have, and I hope -LRB- <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON>'s -RRB- appeal to the high court will not be successful,'' said Police Minister <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bar-Lev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bar-Lev </PERSON>, a leading member of the left-of-center <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters his party supported the ban even though <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> would gain if <PERSON> Kach </PERSON> drew votes from the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc. The disqualification, which was expected, passed 28-5 with three abstentions. The motion was brought by seven parties, including <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> and Labor. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> rejected the charge that the party is racist and called the Arabs `` a hostile population.'' `` That is the source of our attitude towards them, not the fact that they are part of another nation or are another color or practice another religion,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. Kach spokesman <PERSON> Baruch </PERSON> <PERSON> Marzel </PERSON> said the party is confident the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> will overturn the decision. `` With the help of God they will reinstate our list,'' he said. <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON>, who was born in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and founded the <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, founded Kach, which means `` Thus'' in <LOCATION> Hebrew </LOCATION>. It calls for the ouster of Arabs from all Israeli-held territory and opposes Jewish-Arab marriages. Arguing for Kach's disqualification, left-wing legislators compared <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON>'s anti-Arab platform to the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>' anti-Semitic policies during World War II. `` When the Jewish people become the dominant majority does it also mean they treat -LRB- minorities -RRB- as those other nations did that lost all shades of humanity?'' said <PERSON> Haim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> of Labor. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> traded new allegations over an alleged wiretapping scandal dubbed the `` Israeli Watergate.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>, was quoted today in the daily <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> as saying <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s alleged bugging of <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> campaign headquarters was a `` shameful phenomenon.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> also was quoted as telling a closed forum of supporters that his party must `` shake the world and do anything to stop them -LRB- Labor -RRB-'' from winning the election. `` When I consider the possiblity that the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> may not win, it drives me mad,'' the Maariv daily quoted him as saying. `` They -LRB- Labor members -RRB- are capable of anything, they must be stopped.'' <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> has asked Attorney General <PERSON> Yosef </PERSON> <PERSON> Harish </PERSON> to investigate Labor on suspicion it bugged <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> facilities and the home phone of campaign chairman <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Harish </PERSON> is considering the request. Asked about evidence of bugging, <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Naveh </PERSON> would say only that <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> heard crackling in his line, and his wife spotted prowlers in her yard last week Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>, belittled the charges. `` This is puppet theater, and I do n't see any real person there on stage,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said Tuesday during a campaign swing through industrial towns in northern <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> both claimed victory today in the first major test of the campaign _ the launching of crucial television ads Tuesday night. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> presented slick spots with an upbeat jingle, flag-waving children and a statesmanlike <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> calling for a fair campaign. Labor and its policies were rarely mentioned. Labor took a more aggressive stand, repeatedly contrasting its positions to that of <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>. A stern announcer hinted that <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>'s policies would lead to war Both parties referred only briefly to the 10-month Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories, although both have billed <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace as the crucial campaign issue. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> promised that once <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> is in government, it will `` immediately propose peace talks'' with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> enemies. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> urged voters to `` give me the mandate to bring an end to war and ensure peace for our country.''

 A woman who was hospitalized after she took an overdose of pills during a break in a foreclosure hearing on her family's farm also was troubled by death and illness in her family, authorities said. <LOCATION> Westmoreland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Greensburg </LOCATION> declined to release a condition report on <PERSON> Ida </PERSON> <PERSON> Depta </PERSON>, 48, of <LOCATION> Alverton </LOCATION>, but the family's attorney said she was in stable condition Mrs. <PERSON> Depta </PERSON> was admitted Tuesday after swallowing unidentified pills from two prescription bottles in a courthouse hallway while foreclosure negotiations broke for lunch, said paramedic <PERSON> Harley </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>. The proceedings were then postponed. `` She stated to us that all she wants to do is to join her mom at the cemetery,'' said Deputy Sheriff <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON>. `` She's just upset over her mom, her brother is dying of cancer and the possible loss of the farm.'' Witnesses said Mrs. <PERSON> Depta </PERSON>'s 18-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Julie </PERSON>, was able to remove some of the pills from her mother's mouth. The foreclosure, filed in 1985 by <ORGANIZATION> ITT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Greensburg </LOCATION>, involves a $ 111,251 debt by Mrs. <PERSON> Depta </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Depta </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, on a family dairy farm in <LOCATION> Westmoreland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. The fact that she took the pills in front of other people `` tells me she was n't so much trying to kill herself as she was asking for help,'' <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakles </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the family's attorney, said today. According to <PERSON> Nakles </PERSON> and court documents, the foreclosure hearing was the latest in a series of woes for the family. Mrs. <PERSON> Depta </PERSON>'s mother died on Aug. 24 <PERSON> Depta </PERSON> was injured in a 1984 traffic accident and has since been unable to work, which cut into the farm's income. The family also lost 18 cows when a cow bought from a supplier had a contagious disease that spread through the herd. The Deptas have taken legal action against the supplier.

<HEAD>Eastern Earthquake Said Nearly Certain To Strike Within 20 Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Americans living east of the <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> have a major earthquake in their future _ probably in the next two decades _ a panel of experts is warning. `` Terra firma is an illusion,'' <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Christesen </PERSON>, chairman of the board of <ORGANIZATION> Ebasco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday at a symposium called to discuss earthquake hazards and the federal response. He said any portion of the nation can be affected by quakes. `` The major problem is lack of awareness that there is a problem,'' added <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ketter </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Earthquake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>. `` The public is not concerned because people have not felt a quake in their lifetime. This -LRB- meeting -RRB- is an effort to shake up that complacency,'' <PERSON> Ketter </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ketter </PERSON> warned that a major earthquake is nearly certain to strike the eastern two-thirds of the nation in the next 20 years, threatening havoc in a region unprepared for such a disaster. While he could not pin down a specific location for the temblor, he said likely sites include the areas of <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. He also included a western area on the list: <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. The probability of a destructive quake occurring at any particular spot is low, <PERSON> Ketter </PERSON> said. `` However, the probability of one occurring somewhere in the eastern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> before the year 2000 can be considered better than 75 percent to 95 percent. Before the year 2010, nearly 100 percent.'' Unlike Californians, residents of the states east of the <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> have paid little attention to the danger of quakes. There are no building codes calling for quake resistant buildings in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ketter </PERSON> said, and little public notice of the danger. And yet the strongest earthquakes ever to strike the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> occurred in the <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn.-New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, region in 1811-1812, <PERSON> Ketter </PERSON> noted. In addition, a disastrous quake shook <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, in 1886, and other strong quakes have been felt in the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> area and along the U.S.-Canadian border. A tremor shook <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in the 1800s, he said, that, if repeated today, would cause as much as $ 7 billion in damage in the <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> area. While <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> _ in particular along the famous <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andreas </LOCATION> fault _ has been the subject of great attention, quakes in the East are less well understood. But when they do occur, the rigid rock underlying the states east of the <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> carries the shock to much greater distances than <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> temblors. The 1811-1812 quakes in the Missouri-Tennessee border region caused church bells to ring as far away as <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, 1,000 miles distant, <PERSON> Ketter </PERSON> said. Those quakes are little remembered because the region was only sparsely populated at the time. If they were repeated today the result would be havoc, <PERSON> Ketter </PERSON> and others reported. <PERSON> Ketter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Chartrand </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> at the Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, presented a scenario for a new Memphis-area quake. A tremor equivalent to one of the three major shocks of the past could be expected to kill as many as 200 people, injure 8,000 and leave an estimated 250,000 homeless in the <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> vicinity, <PERSON> Chartrand </PERSON> estimated. And <PERSON> Ketter </PERSON> said the potential death toll could range from nearly 700 to almost 5,000 in the six cities nearest the center of the quake: <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Paducah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Carbondale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Evansville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>.; Poplar Bluff, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>.; and Little Rock, Ark. Near the epicenter most homes and buildings could collapse; dams, dikes and embankments would fail; and there would be landslides. Farther away, masonry houses could collapse, frame houses shift on their foundations, trees topple and cracks appear in slopes, <PERSON> Ketter </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Chartrand </PERSON>'s study forsees a bridge collapse over the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>; widespread flooding in the <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> area; failure of gas, electric, water and sewer systems; disruption of oil and natural gas pipelines passing through the region; hospitals damaged and overwhelmed with patients; transportation disrupted; and other major problems.

 Crew members trying to pump sea water from a ship's cargo hold inadvertently flooded the compartment with carbon monoxide fumes, killing two men and injuring 14 others, including rescue workers, officials said Rescue workers became endangered Tuesday because they had to take off their oxygen equipment to squeeze into the hold, accessible only through a two-foot opening, fire-rescue Capt. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolbert </PERSON> said. The fumes were generated by a gasoline-powered pump that had long been used to empty sea water from the cargo hold aboard the Panamanian-registered Turrialda, city fire spokeswoman <PERSON> Nivia </PERSON> <PERSON> Boaz </PERSON> said. Crew members <PERSON> Stacey </PERSON> <PERSON> Taibel </PERSON>, 55, and <PERSON> Fajaido </PERSON> <PERSON> Alamacio </PERSON>, 30, were pronounced dead of cardiac arrest at <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Baderman </PERSON> said.

A fifth crew member, a firefighter and two police officers were in fair condition today. Six other firefighters were treated and released after being overcome by fumes.

<TEXT>
 A Turkish court has indicted a former teacher in the attempted assassination of Premier <PERSON> Turgut </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> four months ago, the <ORGANIZATION> Anatolia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Kartal </PERSON> <PERSON> Demirag </PERSON> was indicted Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which charged him with attempted premeditated murder for shooting at <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> while the premier was delivering a speech to members of his governing <ORGANIZATION> Motherland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The indictment, which said <PERSON> Demirag </PERSON> held neo-fascist views, also charged him with carrying an unlicensed weapon and using a false identity, according to the news agency. One of the two shots Demirag fired hit the microphone in front of the premier and the other struck <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON>'s thumb. Bodyguards returned fire, wounding 20 other people and the gunman. <PERSON> Demirag </PERSON> was sentenced last year to 10 years in prison for knifing a man in a coffeehouse brawl. He escaped from jail in January and remained in hiding until the assassination attempt. No trial date has been set. Turkish newspapers reported earlier that <PERSON> Demirag </PERSON> was a member of the youth organization of the defunct neo-fascist <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The party's youth branch, known as the Gray Wolves, participated in terrorism that claimed about 5,000 lives from 1978 to 1980 and that led to a military takeover in 1980. The indictment said <PERSON> Demirag </PERSON> had a grudge against <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> for not declaring an amnesty for right-wing activists after he was elected premier, <ORGANIZATION> Anatolia </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Mehmet </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Agca </PERSON>, the Turkish gunman who shot and wounded Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> in 1981, also allegedly belong to the Gray Wolves.

 Thousands of troops guarded polling places today and voters stood in mile-long lines to cast `` yes'' or `` no'' ballots on a proposal to extend President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s 15-year rule to 1997 Power outages blamed on terrorist bombings plunged the capital and other cities into darkness late Tuesday, but the country was calm as polls opened at 8 a.m. By midmorning, thousands of voters lined up at <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> voting centers, waiting patiently under a sunny, cloudless sky in warm spring weather. <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s 7.4 million registered voters are required by law to vote. Some voters said they arrived early for fear of trouble later in the day. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, who voted downtown late this morning, spoke sarcastically of the blackout by using the slogan of the opposition: `` It's the joy that's coming.'' But the 72-year-old army commander told reporters he heard no reports of incidents in the first hours of voting. `` There are no problems,'' he said. `` The people are voting normally.'' <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, who campaigned hard across the country for a `` yes'' vote, was asked about the outcome and said, `` I'm always optimistic.'' Among early voters was <PERSON> Patricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>, president o the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and leader of a 16-party coalition campaigning for <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s defeat. `` It's like returning to the times of the republic,'' he declared after casting his ballot in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s first presidential vote since 1970. The downtown was virtually deserted, with shops and offices closed for election day, a national holiday. Radio reports also indicated a heavy turnout without serious problems in provincial cities and towns. If a majority votes `` yes,'' <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> will assume a new eight-year term in March. If most vote `` no,'' an open election with two or more candidates will take place next year, and the winner will assume the presidency in March 1990. At least eight explosions were heard in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> on Tuesday night, moments after the power outage affected a 1,300-mile stretch of the country. Police said terrorists bombed at least three electrical towers, but said they had no reports of damage or injuries from the subsequent explosions, indicating they may have been noise bombs intended to frighten but not harm. The nation's long-idled election machinery was put back in place for the referendum on <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, who lifted emergency rule and loosened his tight grip on the opposition in the months preceding the balloting. The first unofficial returns are to be released about an hour after polls close at 5 a.m. The opposition coalition, distrustful of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s tabulations, planned a separate vote count The group says it will accept as official the results of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which are to be disclosed on Friday. Gen. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Zincke </PERSON>, military commander of <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, said officials were ordered to provide access at polling places to an estimated 500 foreign observers. `` We have nothing to hide,'' he said. About 150,000 members of the armed forces and national police have been on barracks alert since Sunday. If <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s new eight-year term is approved, the military junta he leads, which theoretically served as the legislative branch of his government, will be disbanded. A new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would be seated in 1990, with two-thirds elected and the remaining third appointed by <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>. Whatever the outcome of the referendum, congressional elections will be held in 1990, but the legislature will have limited authority. It will be virtually powerless to amend a 1980 constitution, which gives the military autonomy and a supervisory role in national policy-making. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> has pointed to an improved economy and the promise of growth and stability if he is retained as president. His critics say the rich have benefited the most and that human rights abuses continue under his rule. About 3 million of the 7.4 million voters were too young to vote in 1973, when <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> led a bloody coup that toppled the elected government of President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, a Marxist. <PERSON> Allende </PERSON> died in the coup. In 1978, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s military government won a vote of confidence and in 1980, it won passage the a new constitution. But both ballots were loosely organized, with no formal voter registration and few if any protections against fraud, which opposition groups say was widespread. This time, the opposition has expressed satisfaction with the safeguards.

 Attorneys announced in court today the tentative settlement of a lawsuit filed by Canadians who suffered emotional trauma from mind-control therapy, including doses of the drug LSD, given them in the 1950s. Lawyers for the government and the nine original plaintiffs did not specify the amount of the settlement during a brief hearing before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON>. But sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> had tentatively agreed to pay a lump sum of $ 750,000 to settle the case. Lawyers for both sides sought postponement in the trial of the eight-year-old case that was to begin Thursday, telling <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> that the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will soon review the negotiated settlement.

 The divorce-fixing trial of former Miss America <PERSON> Bess </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>, her lover and a judge is `` about money and greed and the abuse of power,'' a federal prosecutor said. But defense lawyers countered in opening statements Tuesday that the case was unjustified, `` contrived'' and `` ridiculous.'' Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>, 64, the city's former cultural affairs commissioner, is on trial with <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> `` <PERSON> Andy </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>, 43, and former state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Hortense </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>, 75, who presided over part of <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>'s bitter divorce. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheinkman </PERSON>, a matrimonial law expert from <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, became the first person to testify today He explained the intricate workings of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s state court system, in which the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, where Mrs. <PERSON> Gable </PERSON> served, is a low-level court where trials are held. As a prosecutor passed out a list of legal terms to jurors, <PERSON> Scheinkman </PERSON> also gave the jurors a quick course in the jargon of divorce court. The three defendants face five counts each of conspiracy, mail fraud and bribe-related charges for an alleged scheme to slash <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>'s weekly child support and alimony payments. Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> is accused of giving a $ 19,000-a-year city job to Mrs. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Sukhreet </PERSON>, who was then 34, shortly after became cultural affairs commissioner in 1983 to get the judge to reduce <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>'s temporary support payments to his wife. Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> was named a co-respondent in the <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON> divorce. She is also charged with obstructing justice for allegedly trying to keep <PERSON> Sukhreet </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> from testifying truthfully before a federal grand jury. `` This is a case about money and greed and the abuse of power,'' Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> told the jury Tuesday. `` It is about the use of secrets, deceptions and lies to keep the truth from the public.'' Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON>, who was Miss America 1945, was forced by the scandal _ known locally as the `` Bess Mess'' _ to resign her city post last year. Describing her as `` one of the celebrities of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> said, `` This case is about whether such privileged people are above the law.'' But <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>'s attorney insisted it was the result of a scorned wife's accusations. `` There was no fury as intense and mean-spirited as that of <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>,'' defense lawyer <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> said in a loud voice. Lawyers for Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> attacked the government's case as purely circumstantial. `` It's contrived and ultimately one that is ridiculous,'' said <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hafetz </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hafetz </PERSON> disputed the government's contention that Miss <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> schemed to fix <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>'s divorce because she needed his money. The attorney said that at the time, she was worth about $ 10 million. <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON>, once a millionaire sewer and water contractor, is serving a three-year prison term for an unrelated tax conviction. Noting Mrs. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON>'s 40 years of public service, her lawyer, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldberg </PERSON>, asked if it made sense for her to `` risk everything she had worked for'' for a job for her daughter. He said there were no witnesses to or documents on the alleged bribery of the judge. If convicted of all charges, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Myerson </PERSON> would face up to 30 years in prison and $ 513,000 in fines. <PERSON> Capasso </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Gabel </PERSON> each could get up to 25 years and fined $ 263,000.

The disclosure of clandestine arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, aimed at securing the release of the hostages during 1985 and 1986, led to the Iran-Contra affair. It was the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s administration's worst foreign policy controversy. <PERSON> Bani-Sadr </PERSON> said that according to his information, a man named <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawless </PERSON> negotiated <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s release. `` It seems he -LRB- Lawless -RRB- has denied it,'' <PERSON> Bani-Sadr </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, where he lives in exile. `` I am trying to verify it.'' White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>: `` There is a fellow named Lawless. He is over there. What he's up to, nobody knows. But he does n't represent the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ... He does not represent the vice president or the president or anybody else.'' `` His charges are not true _ from top to bottom,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said today. `` <PERSON> Bani-Sadr </PERSON>'s full of beans.'' The presidential spokesman also rejected for the second day in a row any government connection with Lawless. `` He's not operating under our instructions,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bani-Sadr </PERSON> said the prior channel for contacts between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> no longer works and a new one has just been created. He did not elaborate but said a new intermediary had just left for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He would not identify the intermediary either by name or nationality, saying he did not want to ruin the chances of more hostage releases. Sixteen hostages, including nine Americans, are believed held by Moslem extremists loyal to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bani-Sadr </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been dealing since last February with <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, speaker of the Iranian Parliament. He said representatives of both <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> have been in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for talks. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Dayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, `` That's not true. It's preposterous.'' <PERSON> Bani-Sadr </PERSON>, who fled <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in 1981, said intense efforts to free hostages were under way and that he has been told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was trying very hard to work out the release of American hostages in early October. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign spokeswoman <PERSON> Alixe </PERSON> <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>: `` Those assertions are absolutely false. Absolutely no one is representing the vice president, the office of the vice president or the campaign in any dealings with the hostages, or any other dealings with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.'' The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has steadfastly denied that it has undertaken any talks directly with Iranian officials to get the hostages released. <PERSON> Bani-Sadr </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> wants the release of Iranian assets frozen in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has filed claims before a joint U.S.-Iranian claims tribunal for $ 12 billion in military equipment frozen as a result of the 1979 Iranian revolution. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> also seeks release of billions of Iranian funds frozen in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks after seizure of 52 hostages at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy in 1979. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say $ 9 billion in financial assets have either been returned to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> or paid to its creditors.

 Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers throughout the nation. Oct. 4 <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION> -RRB- World on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> leadership shakeup: On Friday, it was announced that -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> would succeed retiring Old Guardsman <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> as president. There were other important changes in the leadership, including the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>. All were calculated to advance <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> loyalists. Perhaps more important, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> anounced that the Supreme Soviet, the nation's nominal parliament, would assume a greater role in everyday management of the country. The Soviets -LRB- government councils -RRB- also were promised more power, obviously at the expense of the central <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> apparatus. ... None of this means that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is turning democratic in the Western definition of that word. But it does mean that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> plans to deal with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s severe internal divisions with some accommodation and negotiation.

The space shuttle program was grounded for 32 months after the Challenger blew apart in early 1986. When the shock of the explosion eased, the nation discovered it had put too many space eggs in the shuttle basket. ... In addition, the announcement that <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Gen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrahamson </PERSON>, commander of the SDI program for the past five years, was resigning his post was a milestone in recognizing reality. ... For whether Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> wins the presidency, the Star Wars program is phasing down, although not out. The only question is, how deeply to cut. ... The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> is back in space.

 Oct. 4 The <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-Intelligencer </ORGANIZATION> on welfare reform: Despite rave reviews for the new federal welfare law from supporters in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the poor should not raise their hopes too high. The lukewarm endorsement of Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Slattery </PERSON>, D-Kan., probably is an accurate appraisal <PERSON> Slattery </PERSON> called the long-awaited legislation `` strictly marginal.'' `` It's a coin flip as to whether it will work,'' he said. `` On a marginal basis, I support this bill. Those who vote against it may have a better reason than I.'' ... During the welfare debate, there was a lot of high-minded speechifying in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about `` raising families out of the mire of poverty'' and such. But political actions, as always, spoke louder than political talk. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will raise $ 375 million of its new $ 3.3 billion welfare bill by taking away from working parents of children 12-14 an income tax deduction for child care. And, while telling welfare mothers they must get jobs to support their families, it refused to raise the minimum wage above $ 3.35 an hour.

Whenever the winds of public opinion shift, the pollsters detect the change almost instantly and order a new course. That keeps the campaigns custom tailored to the ever-shifting national concensus. What do the candidates really think about the issues? Who knows. But if you want to know what they'll say they think tomorrow about some piece of campaign business, large or small, just ask yourself how you feel about it today.

 Oct. 2 The Flint -LRB- <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION> -RRB- Journal on the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>' peacekeeping activities: It has been a remarkable year for peace and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. We have witnessed considerable progress in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and elsewhere _ in large part because of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> efforts. But as <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> reminds us, `` The recent achievements of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> have neither been sudden nor fortuitous but are the hard-won results of persistence and dedication over many years, epitomized by the peacekeeping activities of the organization.'' And so it is most fitting that this year's Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping forces. It is, as <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> so eloquently put it, a tribute to `` idealism, valor and sacrifice.'' Recognition is long overdue for the 500,000 troops from 58 countries, including 800 killed in the line of duty, who have helped keep peace and ease tensions in world hot spots since 1948. For 40 years, the world has owed them a debt of gratitude.

Trade restrictions hurt American consumers far more than they help the protected industries because they invite retaliatory countermeasures from other countries.

 Sept. 29 The <LOCATION> Chattanooga </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION> -RRB- Times on congressional honorariums: The decision by two major defense contractors, <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION>, to suspend temporarily their practice of paying honorariums to congressmen for speeches is a welcome reaction to the current investigation of <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> fraud. It's not enough, however. Paying members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for speeches is at best a fraud. A congressman shows up at a function sponsored by a military contractor ..., makes a brief speech, and pockets upwards of $ 2,000. True, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> have imposed some limits, but that does n't make it right. Usually the honorariums are paid to congressmen who serve on committees considering legislation in which the companies or organizations have an interest. The likelihood of a conflict of interest on the part of a congressman is obvious. At first it sounds plausible to argue that the limitation makes it unlikely a congressman will be influenced. But many congressmen receive up to $ 2,000 from each of several companies. When members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> take money from companies that do business with the government, they are at least giving the impression that their votes are for sale. The people deserve better.

This federally mandated work program, coined `` workfare'' since the idea began to take hold, is not without its critics who prefer to call the provision `` slavefare.''

At present, only 10 percent of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> wastes are recycled, compared to half in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and some West European countries.

 A throng of teen-agers at a Christian rock show broke a barricade as they pushed their way toward the stage after promoters announced the show's opening act would not perform, witnesses said. A barricade made of scaffolding and plywood gave way under the rush of fans at the Tuesday night concert by <PERSON> Stryper </PERSON>, a nationally known group that bills itself as a <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> heavy metal rock band. After the problem with the opening act was announced, Stryper's performance as the main act was delayed for an hour No injuries were reported. A small fire broke out when some electrical wiring was trampled, according to officials and witnesses. It was extinguished without incident. The barricade, which was intended to separate spectators from the stage, was removed when it became structurally unsound, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Bismarck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> estimated the crowd at 3,350. `` As soon as the barricade started to bend, the concert stopped and we assessed the situation,'' said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. One of the concertgoers said the rush of fans toward the stage was caused by the announcement that the opening act, White Lion, would not appear. `` Everyone was ticked,'' said <PERSON> Missy </PERSON> <PERSON> Stainaker </PERSON>, who suffered bruises on her ribs.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> `` Buddy'' <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON> won the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> runoff and said he would try to heal wounds from the divisive race while looking ahead to a `` mainstream versus extreme'' contest with Republican <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>. State Insurance Commissioner <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunter </PERSON>, who Tuesday lost a runoff to <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON> in his third try at the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, put on a MacKay button today in <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION>, the state capital. The two pledged to put behind what <PERSON> Gunter </PERSON> had called one of the ugliest campaigns in state history. `` We've had our differences, we're together now; we're going to go forward,'' said <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON>, a third-term congressman. Unofficial returns from Tuesday's runoff gave MacKay 362,234, or 52 percent of the vote, to <PERSON> Gunter </PERSON>'s 330,297, or 48 percent. <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, a former Cape Coral bank president and grandson of the baseball Hall of Fame manager, is a well-funded conservative whose candidacy is drawing national Republican help. He won the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primary on Sept. 6, getting more than half the votes so that a runoff was n't necessary. <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> and <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON> will face each other on the November ballot for the seat held by Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>, who is retiring after three terms. `` We are the candidacy that can beat <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON> said Tuesday night. `` I see this election as mainstream versus extreme.'' <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> agreed that voters faced an ideological decision. `` I think the voters in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> are going to have a very clear choice between the liberal <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON> and the conservative <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> runoff climaxed twisting events that began last December, when <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>, 58, announced he would n't seek re-election, saying he was burned out by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and did n't like the high cost of running for re-election. Popular former two-term Gov. <PERSON> Reubin </PERSON> <PERSON> Askew </PERSON> then entered the race against <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Askew </PERSON>, well ahead in all polls, withdrew May 7, saying he did n't like all the time spent raising funds. <PERSON> Gunter </PERSON> and MacKay jumped in after <PERSON> Askew </PERSON> pulled out, and they ran one-two in the Sept. 6 primary. But neither received a majority, making a runoff necessary. <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON>, a lawyer from a wealthy landowning family, was endorsed by <PERSON> Askew </PERSON>, 1986 Democratic gubernatorial nominee <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Pajcic </PERSON>, third-place primary finisher Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mica </PERSON> and fourth-place finisher state Sen. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>. The runoff campaign was filled with negative advertising and sharp exchanges in debates, and Democratic officials worried that <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> would face a crippled opponent in the general election. <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON>, 55, attacked <PERSON> Gunter </PERSON>'s integrity for his practice each election of using campaign contributions from the insurance industry he regulates, including from two companies that later collapsed in corruption. He also charged that <PERSON> Gunter </PERSON> voted against desegregation 15 years ago. <PERSON> Gunter </PERSON>, 54, charged that <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON>'s congressional record betrayed <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, Social Security and anti-drug efforts, and he claimed <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON> was being supported by corrupt defense contractors. <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON> warned that the well-funded <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> could exploit <PERSON> Gunter </PERSON>'s alleged ethics problems <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, meanwhile, went on the attack against <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON>, running television and newspaper ads charging: `` Hey Buddy, You're liberal!'' <PERSON> Gunter </PERSON> lost a 1974 Democratic <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> runoff and won a 1980 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> runoff only to lose in the general election.

 Dr. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatem </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> physician who devoted his medical career to eradicating venereal diseases in the People's Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, has died in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, state university officials said. <PERSON> Hatem </PERSON>, 78, who died Sunday, had been hospitalized since Aug. 4. He had been diagnosed as having cancer and diabetes. Once called the most beloved American in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, he is widely credited with ridding the world's most populous nation of most syphilis and gonorrhea, and he had hoped to eliminate leprosy from the country by the year 2000. In mainland <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> he was known as Dr. <PERSON> Ma </PERSON> <PERSON> Hai-teh </PERSON>, meaning `` virtue from overseas.'' During the 1950s, he became the first foreigner to become a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> citizen. Officials at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> said a cousin of <PERSON> Hatem </PERSON>'s, who had received a cable from the doctor's widow, informed them of his death Dr. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON>. Sample, president of the university, presented <PERSON> Hatem </PERSON> an honorary doctor of science degree last year in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. `` Over the past half-century, he led the fight against dreadful diseases like cholera, venereal disease and leprosy in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and in the process saved the lives of many millions of Chinese,'' Sample said. The son of <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> immigrants, <PERSON> Shafick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatem </PERSON> _ his first name was Americanized to <PERSON> George </PERSON> _ grew up in <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>. His medical career may have had its roots in an influenza epidemic in 1918, when his entire family was stricken. He recalled later how his family received care from a kindly doctor who made house calls and accepted no payment. With an undergraduate degree from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Hatem </PERSON> started his medical studies at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and received his medical degree from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geneva </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. In 1933, he and two other doctors went to <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> to study tropical diseases. <PERSON> Hatem </PERSON> never came back. Shortly after his arrival in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hatem </PERSON> became friends with journalist <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Snow </PERSON>. When <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON> became head of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, he sent word to <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> that he wanted a `` Western-trained doctor and an honest journalist.'' Snow and <PERSON> Hatem </PERSON> managed to get through the Nationalist army lines to the Communists, where they first met <PERSON> Chou </PERSON> <PERSON> En-lai </PERSON>, then <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hatem </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> when the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> took over <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1949. As chief of staff of the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dermatology </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Venereology </PERSON>, he set up a patriotic health movement. His first targets were acute communicable diseases such as cholera and smallpox. The next battle, against venereal diseases, involved going to brothels, treating the infected prostitutes and shutting down the brothels within 48 hours. The women were retrained in other jobs. <PERSON> Hatem </PERSON> is survived by his wife, Ssu-fei; a son; a daughter; a sister; and two grandchildren.

 Police placed security around seven clinics that perform abortions today, bracing for more demonstrations of the type that put more than 350 people in jail on Tuesday. Demonstrators said authorities impounded one of their buses, forcing a delay in the second day of what they called the `` siege of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>.'' Police did not immediately confirm the impoundment report but said they would continue the rough tactics that brought complaints from demonstration leaders and some civil libertarians. They had announced last week that the relatively gentle tactics used on previous demonstrations would be discontinued. `` I could not believe the level of brutality that was going on here,'' protest leader <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> said Tuesday as police dragged or carried protesters who resisted arrest by crawling on hands and knees. Backers of the anti-abortion group <ORGANIZATION> Operation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> tried but failed to close three clinics with sit-ins Tuesday and said they would hit one today but did not identify it in advance. Police spokeswoman <PERSON> Myrna </PERSON> <PERSON> May </PERSON> said she had no immediate details on the group's claim that a bus was impounded, because she could not get in touch with the officers involved to check it out. A spokeswoman for the demonstrators said the impoundment would delay this morning's planned demonstration until afternoon. Ms. <PERSON> May </PERSON> said most of those arrested Tuesday were charged with criminal trespass and that none had posted bail. Court appearances were scheduled to begin late this afternoon. Operation Rescue spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Nolte </PERSON> had complained Tuesday evening that the protesters were not being processed properly or read their rights. Over the summer, the New York-based group led demonstrations at <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> clinics over several weeks during and after the Democratic National Convention, resulting in 700 arrests. Three of the 700 remain in jail. Most clinics followed their usual schedule Tuesday, said <PERSON> Lynne </PERSON> <PERSON> Randall </PERSON>, executive director of one of the clinics. Most of those arrested were charged with criminal trespass and identified themselves as Baby <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON> or Baby <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> May </PERSON> said. That identification tactic was used in earlier protests, with protesters saying they were expressing solidarity with what they called the anonymous victims of abortion. Authorities have refused to release protesters who would n't give their real names. At a rally Tuesday night at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jude </ORGANIZATION> the <ORGANIZATION> Apostle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in suburbs north of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> urged about 600 people to join today's protests. But only about 75 people said they would participate, and remained for coaching on tactics. Protesters complained that police treated them with unnecessary harshness, twisting arms and fingers and using pressure-point holds just under the ears to force them off the street and into buses. Some screamed or cried as they were taken away. Police asked the protesters if they would walk to the buses before hauling them off when they refused. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerrero </PERSON>, executive director of the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said he asked the city to abandon pressure-point holds. However, he said, `` I've been to a lot of demonstrations and I've seen a lot of police brutality. I have n't seen that today.'' <PERSON> Guerrero </PERSON>, who joined abortion rights advocates in helping escort women through the demonstrators to the clinics Tuesday, said Operation Rescue was going beyond the limits of free speech. `` There is a real interference now,'' he said. Protest organizers complained that the police's tactics, which they had been warned about, led to the injury of the Rev. <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, a demonstrator in his late 50s who is pastor of a church in <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said he was dropped on his head as police carried him to a bus, according to <ORGANIZATION> Grady </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Breyer </PERSON>. <PERSON> Breyer </PERSON> said <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, who was being kept in the hospital's detention unit, would probably be treated and returned to jail. In addition to trespass charges, participants in this week's protests face fines up to $ 500 for contempt of court if they violate a <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge's order limiting the demonstrations The order bans demonstrators from coming within 5 feet of a clinic's property lines and limits the number of pickets to 25 per clinic. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> and others said they would ignore the order. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> was arrested Monday night on charges of conspiracy to commit a crime, but was freed before Tuesday's demonstration after an unidentified family posted $ 75,000 bond.

 Federal investigators said today some food prices have risen faster than warranted by the drought but a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> chairman said there's no proof so far of significant price gouging. `` Some price increases do appear higher than warranted by the drought alone,'' Sen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., told a hearing of his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> He said the higher levels were `` most notably in wheat-based food products, such as pasta and bread, and in some meats.'' `` But in general there do not seem to have been excessive price increases across a broad range of products that use the drought as an excuse,'' he said. The hearing was held to unveil a report from the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> on food price increases between July and August. The report was requested by <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorgan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.D. </LOCATION>, in July amid speculation that the food industry would seize on the drought to hike prices. A <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> official, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Harman </PERSON>, told the committee some price increases found by the congressional investigative agency could not be explained by the drought. He pointed to a 6 percent jump in pasta prices between the July and August checks that the agency made. A rise of 3.4 percent would be warranted by the impact of the drought on durham wheat used to make pasta, he said. He added that cattle prices dropped as a result of the drought but that was not reflected by the cost of beef. Just why there were some unexplained increases was unclear, he said. It may have been because `` prices of packaging of food products went up significantly this year,'' <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenney </PERSON> told the panel. `` There could have been some labor cost increases ... we do n't know if there were,'' <PERSON> Harman </PERSON> said `` Conclusive evidence of price gouging has not been found but there are some indications out there'' that suggest it could materialize in the future, Sen. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Iowa </LOCATION>, told the hearing packed with lobbyists from the nation's multi-billion-dollar food industry `` My advice to consumers is to be comparative shoppers,'' he said. `` Food processors and retailers need to know that we are all watching and they must be held accountable for any food price increases not directly attributable to higher costs,'' <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dorgan </PERSON> said in a statement released Tueslday night. The study showed that the price of ground beef has increased 3 percent, while the price that livestock producers get for cattle actually has dropped 11 percent since April. Rising feed prices have accelerated the sale of cattle and thus created a buyers' market. Fruit prices rose an average of 12 percent, while bread prices increased 4 percent, according to the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>. The lawmakers stressed that the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> figures represented national averages and that there could be differences from one region to another. Two consumer organizations issued a report on Monday saying there had been no `` price gouging'' in July and August but `` substantial'' increases in beef and some other agricultural goods in June. The report was issued jointly by the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> and Washington-based advocacy group, <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION>, Health and Policy.

 A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said today there was no sign any of the nine American held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> would be freed soon. A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> team today began questioning <PERSON> Mithileshwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, an Indian who was freed from captivity in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> on Monday, in hopes of learning the fate of the Americans, the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> official added. The official told reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> hospital in <LOCATION> Wiesbaden </LOCATION> this afternoon: `` One wants to be encouraged that they -LRB- the hostages -RRB- will be released, but we really do n't know.'' Asked about the American hostages, he said: `` There are no indications that others are coming out.'' The official, who is an expert on hostage issues, requested strict anonymity, although he was speaking at a news conference before several dozen journalists. Television crews were ordered not to film his remarks, and the lights were lowered. Earlier today, doctors said <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> was `` in good spirits'' but would stay in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for another three days of medical tests. Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> hospital, said a preliminary examination indicated <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, a 60-year-old diabetic, received adequate medical treatment during his 20 months of captivity. `` He lost significant weight and muscle mass. But he was afforded visits by a physician and treatment was appropriate for his illnesses,'' <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON> said of the Indian finance professor. The doctor said tests done since <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s arrival confirmed his previously known medical problems _ diabetes, hypertension and `` possible coronary artery disease.'' `` Overall Dr. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> is in good spirits and though very fatigued has traveled well,'' <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, a resident alien of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, would likely remain in <LOCATION> Wiesbaden </LOCATION> for another three days of medical tests. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> was freed Monday night in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, and taken to <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. He was flown from the Syrian capital to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s Rhein-Main Base outside <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, arriving at 2:20 a.m The former hostage did not speak to reporters upon arriving in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. He was immediately driven to the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> hospital in <LOCATION> Wiesbaden </LOCATION>, 24 miles west of <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s release leaves 16 foreigners missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and believed held by Moslem extremists. Held longest is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, who was abducted March 16, 1985. Armed men dressed as policemen took <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> hostage Jan. 24, 1987, on the <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> campus in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, along with <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> educators <PERSON> Alann </PERSON> <PERSON> Steen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Polhill </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>. A group calling itself Islamic Jihad for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility, and said it freed <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> as a goodwill gesture. Nearly all the foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> are believed held by Shiite Moslem groups loyal to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> said the three <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> educators were `` OK.'' Then he added: `` It's better for me not to make any statements because we do n't know what might hurt them Please let me be quiet ... It's better for my colleagues.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government was doing `` everything possible'' to free the hostages. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Tuesday that no negotiations would be held with the captors. He said liberating the hostages `` has been a great problem for us and it's very much on our minds.'' In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, former Iranian President <PERSON> Abolhassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bani-Sadr </PERSON> said an aide to Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> named <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawless </PERSON> negotiated <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s release and that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> received arms _ possibly in a deal to free him. However, former <PERSON> Bani-Sadr </PERSON> said Tuesday he did not know if the shipment of weapons was related to the release. He gave no details of the purported weapons transfer. He said representatives of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the Republican presidential nominee, and Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> attended talks in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in an effort to free hostages. Spokesmen for both campaigns denied the assertions. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> expressed regret Tuesday that the Americans were not released with him. `` Thank God I'm free,'' he said. `` But I'm very sorry that my colleagues and friends are still in captivity. I hope they'll be free soon.'' <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> said the four captives `` lived together, but I did not see anyone else.''

Monday's explosion blasted a crater 200 feet wide and smashed 20 apartment buildings to rubble in the city 850 miles east of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, reporter <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanatin </PERSON> wrote in <LOCATION> Komsomolskaya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pravda </LOCATION>. He wrote that he found a mother who had lived in one of the buildings wandering in the street and repeating: `` I snatched him from under the plaster. <PERSON> Seryozha </PERSON>, my son. He's 5 years old. And he's alive!'' Four people were killed and 500 sought medical care, the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION> reported. Of those, 90 were hospitalized. Initial reports Tuesday said 280 people sought medical care and that 87 were hospitalized. The latest reports said 359 families were left homeless. The explosions blasted a 30-foot-deep crater, set fire to tanks of oil and gas and blanketed <LOCATION> Sverdlovsk </LOCATION> with dark smoke, the government paper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said. The explosions damaged 108 stores, 86 restaurants and seven hospitals, said <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION>. Glass was broken five miles away from the railyard, <ORGANIZATION> Komsomolskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Komsomolskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> said firefighters guarded other damaged oil tanks to prevent the blaze from setting off more explosions. The accounts in the state-run media did not identify the explosives. They said only that they were for use in the domestic economy. The disaster was the latest in a series of major accidents that have prompted sharp criticism of the heavily used Soviet rail system. An express passenger train crashed on its way from <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Aug. 17, killing 24 people and injuring more than 100. In June, three box cars loaded with explosives blew up in the industrial city of <LOCATION> Arzamas </LOCATION> about 240 miles east of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Eighty people died in that blast and 229 were injured. The press accounts blamed the <LOCATION> Sverdlovsk </LOCATION> explosion on a dispatcher who ordered the freight train to halt at the wrong location on a track leading into the railyard. The cars loaded with explosives became disconnected from the locomotive and started rolling away. Engineer <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pimenov </PERSON> managed to reconnect the locomotive, but could not stop the train before it slammed through a junction into the coal train, the reports said. A commission was formed to investigate the accident.

<HEAD>White House Pondering New Contra Aid Bid</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is studying prospects for seeking congressional approval for the release of $ 16.5 million in military aid to the Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said today. `` We are analyzing that possibility,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters at his daily briefing. `` A final decision has not been made.'' The spokesman noted that language in the recently-signed <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> appropriations bill permits <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to request a separate congressional vote on whether to release those weapons to the rebels. There is $ 16 million of stockpiled military goods in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. It was purchased with earlier money, which has been frozen because of the peace process and cease-fire between two sides. <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> leaders say chances for approval of such an maneuver would be a long-shot at best. The bill `` authorizes the release of $ 16 million in lethal material that had been purchased earlier but had not been delivered ... and it sets forth findings that the president would make in requesting that release,'' the spokesman said. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that under the legislation the president must find that <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> has caused a crisis in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, must consult with the four Central American democracies and must then justify the request to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. He said the president's justification for the release of the aid must also meet two of three conditions cited in the legislation. Of the three, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, the administration believed that two had been met _ continuing unacceptable levels of Soviet aid and Sandinista violations of the peace accords. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the third condition _ that the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have initiated an `` all-out attack'' against the Contras _ was `` an open question.'' `` The status is, it's all under consideration and we have n't made a formal decision,'' the spokesman said Although congressional leaders had once hoped to close their session by the end of September, continued wrangling over such matters as anti-drug legislation may keep lawmakers in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> until next week.

<HEAD>Researcher Warns: Be Prepared for Climate Change</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Mankind </LOCATION> needs to begin considering how it will cope with a warmer climate in the future, instead of just trying to figure out ways to head off the `` greenhouse effect'' on the atmosphere, a scientist said Wednesday. `` One effect -LRB- of warming -RRB- could be to present us with a future that is remarkably different from the present,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riebsame </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION>. `` We ought to be thinking, as a society, about how we can adapt to changes,'' Riebsame, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hazards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Applications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at the school, told a symposium sponsored by a consortium of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> colleges. `` We all know that climate has changed on this planet in the past ... and it's likely to change again,'' agreed <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vonder </PERSON> <PERSON> Haar </PERSON>, who heads <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in the Atmosphere at <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. The hot, dry summer of 1988 helped attract considerable attention to the greenhouse phenomenon. Scientists believe the effect occurs when increasing amounts of carbon dioxide and other gases trap the heat of the sun, warming the planet, although they are not sure if this summer was an example or was just unusually hot. Response to warnings about climate change have concentrated on legislation and international agreements seeking to reduce the gases involved, in hopes of preventing the overheating of the Earth. That is a worthwhile effort, <PERSON> Riebsame </PERSON> said, noting that the effort could also reduce acid rain and reduce fossil fuel use. `` But some climate change is going to occur anyway,'' he said. `` The bottom line is, it does n't take much change to put you in new social conditions,'' <PERSON> Riebsame </PERSON> said `` Small changes in means -LRB- averages -RRB- can bring large changes in extremes.'' Some researchers have estimated that the greenhouse effect could increase the planet's average temperature by 2 degrees to 3 degrees Celsius -LRB- 3.2 to 4.8 degrees Fahrenheit -RRB- over the next few decades, <PERSON> Riebsame </PERSON> said. That may not sound like much, but the seemingly small numbers give a false sense of security, he said. For example, the decade of the 1930s, the Dust Bowl years that parched the nation in the worst heat and drought on record, averaged only 1.2 degrees Celsius above normal, he pointed out. `` I'm not saying we're going to hell in a hand basket, but we need an insurance policy,'' said <PERSON> Riebsame </PERSON>. At the least, he said, `` we ought to be looking at past climate changes and asking ourselves, what would we do if that happened today to come through with flying colors.'' Pinning our hopes on avoiding the greenhouse warming would be a mistake, he said. Instead, research needs to be done on adaptation, new methods of agriculture, forestry, flexible planning for change and reconsideration of the policy of seeking a maximum sustained yield from the land. Warming will change crop growth patterns, water availability and many other things, <PERSON> Riebsame </PERSON> noted. This year, for example, low water disrupted transportation on the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. A variety of potential threats have been reported by scientists looking into the greenhouse effect, including a northward shift in the major grain growing areas, drought in many areas and melting of the polar ice caps, resulting in a rise in sea levels that could threaten coastal communities with inundation. The planet's average temperature has warmed about one-half degree Celsius in the last century, <PERSON> Riebsame </PERSON> noted, a period when industrial development sharply increased the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

 <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> computer expert <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recovery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, knew there was a <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> with a Data Recovery in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, but the coincidence did n't bother him until the other was charged with murder. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, 39, of <LOCATION> Farmington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, said he became seriously concerned when he learned a friend in the computer industry had received 20 telexes and calls wanting to know `` what in God's name had gotten into me.'' He said he wants everyone, particularly his 100 clients nationwide, to know that he and his company are different from the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and his company. The man jailed 2,000 miles away in a case that drew national attention is <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, 35, of <LOCATION> Anaheim </LOCATION>, who was charged last month with murdering his wife for $ 1 million insurance in 1985 and getting his teen-age daughter to take the blame. The daughter, Cinnamon, now 18, was found hours after the slaying, in a backyard doghouse, suffering from a drug overdose. She clutched a note that read, `` Dear God, please forgive me. I did n't mean to hurt her.'' Prosecutors filed charges against her father after Cinnamon, having served three years in a youth detention center, began talking. The <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brown </LOCATION>, 39, said Tuesday by telephone that he knew of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> man and the identical business name and had talked to him about it at least three years ago. `` We kind of laughed about it,'' he said. He learned of the arrest a week and half ago. `` A friend that's in the computer business called me at home Monday -LRB- Sept. 26 -RRB- and said, ` Guess who's in jail for murder?' and I just jokingly said, ` I dunno, your brother <PERSON> George </PERSON>?' and he said, ` Sit down. ` He says, ` <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, owner of Data Recovery. I said, ` What kind of joke is this?' He said, ` A guy out in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.''' The next day he was installing computer equipment for a customer when a worker he has known for years came in, sat down and told him she was going to ask something that no one else had the nerve to ask. She handed him a front-page article on the arrest, he said. `` After I read the article she said, ` What have you got to do with that?' I looked at her and I said, ` Well, obviously nothing. I'm not in jail.' Records at <LOCATION> Anaheim </LOCATION> City Hall show that <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> took out a license in 1982 for the name Data Recovery @ Data Safe Technology. In 1988 he received a license for the name Data Recovery. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recovery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> was incorporated in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> in 1981. The <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who has been married for 17 years, said his parents advised him to change the name of the company, which does about $ 600,000 to $ 700,000 business a year, but he does n't want to because of the reputation he has established. He said he has n't lost any clients but calls `` have been very sparse this week.'' `` All of the customers that I have talked with have apologized up and down for even thinking it,'' he said.

<HEAD>Ghost Haunts Moscow Dormitory</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A dormitory for women workers has a ghost that steals boots and plays `` Knock-Knock'' with some of the residents, a newspaper reported Wednesday. The labor daily <ORGANIZATION> Trud </ORGANIZATION> said the ghost was discovered three weeks ago by three young housepainters who live in the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> dormitory. It said they had learned to communicate with the specter by a code system of knocks _ one for yes and two for no. When two Trud reporters visited the dormitory, the specter had stolen a boot, according to the paper's account. The women asked several questions and got one knock, for yes, after asking whether the boot was behind a shelf. <PERSON> Trud </PERSON> said the painters became aware of the ghost in mid-September when it knocked loudly on a door and began making the door open and close one night. `` Although specialists are in no hurry to pronounce themselves definitively, it seems more and more likely that in these and several other similar situations what is occuring is a rare natural phenomenon _ a poltergeist,'' the report said. A poltergeist is defined as a noisy and usually mischievous ghost held responsible for unexplained noises, such as rappings. Although Soviet society is officially materialist, there is enormous interest here in flying saucers, the <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Triangle </LOCATION>, ghosts, extrasensory perception and such real or imaginary monsters as the Abominable Snowman. Even the staid <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> has a commission `` on abnormal phenomena.'' Trud asked commission chairman <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Troitsky </PERSON> to comment on the dormitory ghost and quoted him as replying: `` In our country, the principle is still current that these things ca n't happen, because they could never happen.''

 The White House is considering asking <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to soon release $ 16.5 million in stockpiled weapons to the Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` We are analyzing that possibility,'' <PERSON> Fitwater </PERSON> told reporters at his daily briefing. `` A final decision has not been made at this point.'' Prospects for renewing military aid to the rebels has been deemed a long shot by congressional leaders, who hope to have the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> adjourn for the year next week so that lawmakers can campaign full-time for re-election. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> rejected an administration military aid request last Feb. 3 and the formal cutoff of weapons deliveries to the Contras occurred on Feb. 29. Some $ 16.5 million in military equipment has been stockpiled in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. It was purchased with earlier <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid, but its delivery was frozen because of the peace process and cease-fire between the Contras and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista government. Asked about the possibility of renewed aid, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> noted that a provision in defense appropriations bill <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed last weekend permits the president to request a congressional vote on whether to release the weapons to the rebels.

 <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON>'s daughter married a young musician she's been dating for three years during a private ceremony this week at the Church of Scientology, her publicist said today. <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON>, 20, and musician <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Keogh </PERSON>, 23, recited wedding vows Monday during the small service at the huge Hollywood headquarters for the church, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> said.

 There are no signs that the nine American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> will be freed soon, despite the release of an Indian captive, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said Wednesday. Doctors said former hostage <PERSON> Mithileshwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> was in good spirits but under tremendous stress. The official said a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> debriefing team started questioning <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, an Indian citizen and resident alien of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, in hopes of learning about the American hostages. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> went to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wiesbaden </LOCATION> early Wednesday, two days after his captors released him in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in what they said was a goodwill gesture. Sixteen foreign hostages are still held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` One wants to be encouraged that they will be released, but we really do n't know,'' the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said at the hospital. `` There are no indications that others are coming out.'' The official, an expert on hostage issues, spoke on condition of strict anonymity at a news conference. Television crews were ordered not to film the comments, and the lights were dimmed. Of those holding hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said: `` It is our opinion that they are under the influence of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, and are part of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>.'' He added later: `` There are indications that they -LRB- the kidnappers -RRB- are backed by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, we assume financed by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.'' A team of 10 to 12 <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials flew to <LOCATION> Wiesbaden </LOCATION> on Wednesday to interview <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, 60, who was a captive for 20 months. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> said after his release that three American educators abducted with him were `` OK.'' `` It's better for me not to make any statements because we do n't know what might hurt them,'' he `` Please let me be quiet. ... It's better for my colleagues.'' <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> aboard a military transport plane. He has not spoken to reporters since he arrived in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> Wiesbaden </LOCATION> hospital, told reporters that a preliminary examination indicated <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> was given adequate medical treatment during his captivity. `` He lost significant weight and muscle mass. But he was afforded visits by a physician and treatment was appropriate for his illnesses,'' <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON> said the kidnappers allowed a doctor to visit <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> twice a week. He said testing done in <LOCATION> Wiesbaden </LOCATION> confirmed his previously known problems of diabetes, hypertension and `` possible coronary artery disease.'' `` Overall, Dr. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> is in good spirits and though very fatigued has traveled well,'' <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON> said <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> lost 35 to 40 pounds during his ordeal. He said the kidnappers agreed to respect <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s vegetarian diet. `` There is tremendous stress,'' <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON> said, however. `` Singh is exhausted. He said <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> probably would stay for three more days of medical tests in <LOCATION> Wiesbaden </LOCATION>, about 25 miles west of <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON> said <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> told officials that he wants to return to <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> after the tests. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> taught at the now-defunct <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> before moving to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. His release leaves nine Americans and seven other foreigners still missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.

 A slow, underground coal fire discovered by the children plunging sticks into the ground should be put out as soon as possible because it poses a threat to lives and property, officials said Wednesday. State and local officials who surveyed the site on a wooded hillside overlooking a city street proposed that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Office of Surface Mining consider the fire an emergency to keep it from spreading. The agency sent a representative to investigate. The fire was discovered Friday after parents of children who had been playing on the hillside notified the Fire Department. `` They had been sticking sticks in the ground, poking them down, and when they pulled them back up, they were on fire, and they were really fascinated by that,'' said <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Baden </PERSON>, fire chief in this southeastern <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> city of 5,000. `` When we arrived, there were three or four trees on fire and a very hot spot on the ground.'' The fire appeared to be in waste coal from a nearby unmapped mine believed abandoned since the 1920s, said <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>' Division of Reclamation. The fire posed no immediate threat to two houses about 60 feet away. But as many as 30 houses could be threatened if it spreads into the coal seam, officials said. <PERSON> Baden </PERSON> also said there was a possibility of a brush fire. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Miska </PERSON> of the Office of Surface Mining in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> said if his agency agrees there is an emergency, it will begin a cleanup. A decision could be reached by Friday.

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Afghan guerrillas fired rockets at <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> during rush hour Wednesday and killed 13 people, disproving claims that the rebels attack only military targets, Afghan media reported. Radio <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, said 34 people were wounded in the Afghan capital. It blamed the attack on `` criminal extremists,'' a reference to the U.S.-backed rebels who have been fighting the Soviet-backed government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> for 10 years. The broadcast criticized <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> media for `` claiming that the so-called <ORGANIZATION> Mujahedeen </ORGANIZATION> are attacking military installations only.'' Commanders of the Afghan guerrillas have said they attack only military targets, not residential areas. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the official Soviet news agency, said 26 rockets `` exploded on the streets and squares of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> as its four districts came under intensive shelling.'' It quoted <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Bakhtar </ORGANIZATION> news agency as saying 16 shells hit <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> suburbs and that the insurgents increased pressure on the eastern city of <LOCATION> Khost </LOCATION>. It did not report casualties in those attacks. The Soviet news agency said rebels are subjecting <LOCATION> Khost </LOCATION> `` to nearly daily massive rocket and artillery shelling.'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> also said Afghan government forces killed 23 rebels and captured weapons in strikes at bases in <LOCATION> Paktia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Balkh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Samangan </LOCATION> provinces. It reported continuing fighting among the rebels in <LOCATION> Kuhestan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nejrab </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ghazni </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arghandab </LOCATION>, and said about 50 insurgents were killed. Radio <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> said six people were killed in the eastern city of <LOCATION> Gardez </LOCATION> in rocket attacks Tuesday afternoon and Wednesday morning. <LOCATION> Gardez </LOCATION> is 60 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. The Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Pravda reiterated Soviet complaints that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is to blame for violations of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> accord providing for the withdrawal of Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` All indications are that in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, they have a very flawed idea of international law, state-to-state relations and treaty-based commitments,'' the newspaper said. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> said last week it halted the withdrawal of its troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, citing violations of the accord. Pravda said the Afghan government has registered more than 1,500 violations with <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> monitors. Radio <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> charged that among the alleged violations, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is circulating forged afghanis, the local currency, in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. The radio offered no details. Under the accord signed April 14, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> agreed to withdraw its 100,000 soldiers from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in exchange for a pledge of non-interference by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and other countries that have been aiding the guerrillas. The guerrillas are not party to the agreement. Half of the Soviet force in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> was withdrawn between May 15 and Aug. 15, and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has until Feb. 15 to complete the pullout. Soviet troops entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979, replaced one pro-Soviet government with another and remained to fight the anti-Marxist insurgents.

<HEAD>Wright Tells Ethic Committee He Broke No Rules</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> formally denied to the ethics committee Wednesday that he broke <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules by talking openly about a secret <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> operation aimed at undermining <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist government. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, in a letter to ethics chairman Rep. <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, said his Sept. 20 criticism of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>'s purported secret efforts to provoke civil disturbances in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> was based on publicly available information. But the letter left several unanswered questions for the panel, formally known as the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, to examine in its informal probe of the allegations against <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Calif., called the investigation relatively simple, particularly compared to the committee's separate and complex probe into <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s finances `` It's not that complicated a matter,'' he said. `` There are two basic elements: what classified information the speaker may have received, and ... what he said to the press.'' It is against <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules to publicly disclose classified information given to the <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. On Tuesday, the Intelligence panel voted unanimously to grant limited access to its files and personnel for the ethics probe _ access that could enable investigators to determine whether <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> could have based his comments on material disclosed in classified intelligence briefings. The controversy began when <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> told reporters, in answer to a question, that `` we have received clear testimony from <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> people'' about the covert action, which he described as intended to scuttle faltering peace talks between the Sandinistas and the Contra rebels. In a follow-up interview, the speaker said the spy agency had not volunteered specific information about its secret activity, but had acknowledged it only under questioning from members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. He later said he had been aware of the activity since August 1987. But in his letter to <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said his reference to `` clear testimony'' referred to 1985 testimony by `` <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> personnel'' before the World Court. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> did not name the personnel in the letter, but has previously referred to testimony by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> MacMichael </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> analyst, before the court in 1985. At the time <PERSON> MacMichael </PERSON> had been dismissed by the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and was regarded as a renegade, according to <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> members. In Wednesday's letter, he also mentioned written testimony forwarded to the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 by <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>, a former Contra leader who left the rebel movement and became a vocal critic of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>'s handling of the rebels. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> also said `` the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> may never have formally acknowledged'' an intent to provoke <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> overreaction and arrests, as <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> charged in his comments to reporters, `` in any of its testimony before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and it is my impression that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has never authorized such activities.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, said in a statement issued late Tuesday that `` the committee agreed to respond to the request and to make its members and staff available ... in connection with any information transmitted'' to the ethics committee. <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> termed the ethics committee's request for information `` very preliminary'' and added: `` They have n't even started a real investigation yet.'' The action appeared _ at least for the moment _ to satisfy Republicans bent on adding a new layer to the ethics probe already under way into <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s financial dealings. `` Our concerns ... I think have been satisfied,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wyo </LOCATION>., a member of the Intelligence panel <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has repeatedly defended his comments on several levels. He has contended that the comments could have stemmed from publicly available information, but also has said he has a moral obligation to speak out about actions of the administration which he views as wrong.

<TEXT>
 The army said Wednesday it will distribute gas masks to about 37,000 Israelis following reports that Arab countries may resort to chemical weapons in a war against the Jewish state. The test program will be coupled with studies to try to determine if the reported use of chemicals in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war has prompted Israelis to take the threat seriously, said an army spokesman. The masks will be given to 3,000 residents of the town of <LOCATION> Shelomi </LOCATION> on the Israeli-Lebanese border and to about 34,000 people in the <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> suburb of <PERSON> Ramat </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasharon </PERSON>, the spokesman said, speaking on condition of anonymtiy. No exact date has been set for the distribution, but the spokesman said it would take place in the `` near future.'' `` There could eventually be a decision to distribute the masks nationwide,'' he said. `` But that would be real far off. This is only a test case.'' A 1988 Middle East Military Balance report from <ORGANIZATION> Tel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviv </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Jaffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> said chemical weapons are an `` integral part'' of military offensive strategies in Arab countries. `` It appears ... that chemical weapons are an important element in the ... concept of overall strategic parity with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' the report said. `` -LRB- Chemical weapons -RRB- are quickly and easily attainable.'' The army spokesman said <PERSON> Ramat </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasharon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shelomi </PERSON> were chosen for the test because studies show them to be representative of the general population. `` It's possible people have become more aware of the threat of chemical weapons,'' he said. `` But without that awareness, it's pretty useless to give them the masks. In August, the army began equipping troops with newly developed pills that increase immunity to chemical weapons.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> accused South Korean troops Wednesday of firing at one of the North's guard posts in the demilitarized zone separating the countries. The North also accused the South of deliberately increasing tensions after the Olympic Games. The North's official <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the `` grave military provocation'' occurred in the eastern portion of the <ORGANIZATION> DMZ </ORGANIZATION> at about 1:20 p.m. `` Today they fired several pinpoint shots at our side's post from an artillery piece which they had carried into the <ORGANIZATION> DMZ </ORGANIZATION> by stealth,'' said the English-language report monitored in <LOCATION> Toyko </LOCATION>. It said the alleged shooting threatened North Korean military personnel and damaged facilities at the post. The news agency charged that the alleged attack `` vividly proves'' that proposals by the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> government for dialogue and detente between the countries were `` hypocrisy and deception.'' On Tuesday, South Korean President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo called for summit talks with <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON>, leader of the communist <PERSON> North </PERSON>, and said he was ready to cooperate to end tension between the two countries. `` Our people and <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> soldiers are watching with heightened vigilance the moves of the -LRB- South Korean government -RRB- in deliberately rendering the situation strained as soon as the Olympic Games ended,'' <ORGANIZATION> KCNA </ORGANIZATION> said. The North decided to boycott the Olympics, which ended on Oct. 2 in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, after the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Olympic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> turned down its request to be a co-host.

<HEAD>Scientists Trying New Products to Battle Grasshoppers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The age-old war against marauding grasshoppers is being waged with some promising new biological weapons, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. In one development, two commercial firms _ <ORGANIZATION> Evans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> BioControl </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Broomfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Bozeman </PERSON> Bio Tech of <PERSON> Bozeman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mont </PERSON>. _ have adapted <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> technology for producing and storing a parasite, Nosema lucustae. Department studies show the parasite kills 50 percent to 60 percent of grasshoppers in three to four weeks. The basic tests and development were done by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> at the agency's <ORGANIZATION> Rangeland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insect </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON> Bozeman </PERSON> by J.E <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> and colleagues. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> said the parasite is available to homeowners and ranchers through regional agents and on contract to government agencies, which use it on a large scale in the West. <ORGANIZATION> Grasshoppers </ORGANIZATION> cause an estimated $ 400 million in damage to grass and crops each year, he said. Spores of the parasite are put on wheat bran flakes to form a bait. After the insects eat the bait, the organism `` attacks the pest's fat cells and depletes its energy stores,'' <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> said in a report issued here. The parasite remains in the grasshopper population because sick females pass it on to offspring, and survivors eat dead relatives, he said. Meanwhile, another development involves an agreement with <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> <PERSON> Biotechnical </PERSON> to field test another natural killer, grasshopper entomopoxvirus, the agency said. In laboratory tests, the virus kills 20 percent to 30 percent of the grasshoppers right away and stunts the growth of an additional 20 percent to 30 percent. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Streett </PERSON>, an entomoligist at the agency's <PERSON> Bozeman </PERSON> laboratory, said <ORGANIZATION> Evans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> BioControl </ORGANIZATION> plans to produce the virus and mix it with the parasite for tests on 1,000 acres in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Streett </PERSON> said that in combination the two ingredients may work more rapidly to kill the grasshoppers.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Examines Affirmative Action Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> heard arguments Wednesday that programs to reserve some public works contracts for minorities cause reverse discrimination, while proponents said they break down rigid racial barriers. The justices explored the power of state and local governments to give preferential treatment to minority-owned businesses in a key affirmative action case from <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, to be decided by July. At stake could be set-aside programs adopted by most states and some 190 local governments. The <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> plan was intended to fight racial discrimination, `` a scourge of our society,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Payton </PERSON>, a lawyer representing the city. Black participation in the construction trades had been `` close to zero,'' he said. `` The evidence is stark and dramatic'' that blacks were excluded systematically from entering and advancing in the industry. `` Other remedies had no impact. They simply were n't working,'' he added. But <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryland </PERSON>, representing building contractor J.A. <ORGANIZATION> Croson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said setting aside part of the contracts for minorities is reverse discrimination. `` If -LRB- city officials -RRB- wanted to attack societal discrimination, they could do it by racially neutral means,'' he said. <PERSON> Croson </PERSON> successfully challenged the set-aside after the company lost a city contract for failure to include a minority-owned business as a subcontractor. The 4th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled in September 1987 there is insufficient evidence that city officials discriminated against minority-owned businesses in the past and it said the plan's quota appeared to be completely arbitrary. <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> adopted the plan in 1983 to require that a prime contractor on any city building project subcontract at least 30 percent of the value of the project to firms that are at least one-half minority owned. While the minorities named in the plan include Hispanics, Orientals, Indians, Eskimos and Aleuts, the primary beneficiary would be blacks _ who make up around half of <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>'s black population. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has been closely divided on affirmative action disputes, and Wednesday's hour-long argument session provided few hints on the likely outcome of the <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> case. Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, the court's newest member and possibly the key to the outcome of the case, pressed the lawyers on both sides to explain their positions. `` Is -LRB- the set-aside -RRB- the most narrowly tailored remedy'' for racial bias, he asked? <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> suggested that the quota could mean higher costs for city projects. <PERSON> Payton </PERSON> replied `` there is no real constitutional question'' posed by that possibility. `` <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> can decide that is the cost of remedying'' past discrimination. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, participating in his first affirmative action case since joining the court last February, replaced Justice <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, who often cast the deciding vote on programs involving preferential treatment for minorities. The <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> case also may help foretell the court's future approach to other forms of affirmative action and alleged reverse discrimination. The justices in a recent string of decisions generally have upheld preferential treatment for minorities and women. <ORGANIZATION> Ryland </ORGANIZATION> challenged <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>'s motives in adopting the set-aside policy. Noting that the city council had a black majority and that the city's population is around 50 percent black, he said the plan `` could be just a pork-barrel thing.'' But Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> noted that the court in 1980 upheld a similar 10 percent quota adopted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for federal building contracts. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> also might adopt pork-barrel legislation, <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> said, `` but we give it a presumption of validity.'' How <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> selected a 30 percent quota is one of the issues at the heart of the case. <ORGANIZATION> Ryland </ORGANIZATION> said the figure was `` pulled out of the air'' and was `` so high it can force a particularly serious impact on non-minorty firms.'' But <PERSON> Payton </PERSON> said 30 percent is a reasonable compromise in a city that is half black and where historically minority-owned businesses received less than 1 percent of the value of city contracts. Set-aside programs also have caused some deep divisions and seemingly contradictory views within the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, for example, said in 1984 he favored channeling billions of additional contract dollars to minority-owned firms. And the administration generally has looked upon public works set-asides more sympathetically than other affirmative action quotas it sternly opposes. But the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, responding to an invitation from the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in a case similar to the <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> dispute, challenged the constitutionality of set-asides.

<HEAD>President Signs Bill Relieving Tribes of Administrative Chores</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Wednesday signed a bill designed to ease administrative burdens on Indian tribes in connection with a program to transfer some governmental powers from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to the tribal governing bodies. The bill amends a law, enacted in 1975, that provides for tribes to contract for health, housing, social and government services that otherwise would be provided by the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>. The new legislation responds to requests from tribes who said the 1975 act imposed burdensome administrative requirements on them. Among other things, the bill exempts tribal construction contracts from federal procurement rules and regulations and provides that money not spent in one fiscal year can be carried over to the next year. The bill also contains a provision saying the secretaries of the interior and health and human services shall reduce funding to Indian tribes if directed to do so by a member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in a statement accompanying a conference committee report. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said this provision is unconstitutional because only the two houses of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the president can take actions altering the legal duties of executive branch officers. However, he said, the rest of the bill remains valid despite the unconstitutional provision.

<HEAD>Teller's Memory for Scent Helps Bank Recover Missing Money</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A bank teller who mistakenly handed out $ 25,000 instead of $ 250 put police on the scent after realizing the customer smelled like a certain <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> restaurant, police said. The customer _ who turned out to be a busboy at the Three Happiness Restaurant _ had been sent to <LOCATION> Lakeside </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> on Tuesday to get change for $ 500 _ half in coins and half in $ 1 bills. The teller grabbed $ 100 bills by mistake, put them in a counting machine and sent the man off with $ 250 in coins plus $ 25,000 in bills, said Sgt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>. When the mistake was discovered, the teller was unable to name the person to whom she had given the windfall. But her nose gave police the only lead they needed. `` The young lady who made the error recalled the individual who came to get the change had a certain odor about him characteristic of one of the restaurants in <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said. The teller picked the exact restaurant, telling police that the aroma came from the cooking oils used there. Police recovered the money from the unidentified busboy, who had hidden it at a relative's home, police said. Authorities were prepared to charge the busboy under laws governing theft of lost or mislaid property, but the bank declined to prosecute to preserve good relations with customers in <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Moy </PERSON>, manager of the restaurant, said Wednesday that the 25-year-old busboy had been fired but that he was sympathetic toward the young man, who undoubtedly considered his find `` lucky money.'' `` The mistake was from the bank, not from the boy,'' <PERSON> Moy </PERSON> said. After the teller discovered her error, she went to the restaurant to speak to the busboy, but he denied any role, and police were summoned, <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Porcaro </PERSON>, a spokesman for the bank, said of the teller he would not identify: `` It was an oversight that was corrected.''

 U.S.-Vietnamese teams retrieved two sets of human remains in an unprecedented joint search of the countryside for airmen missing in the Vietnam War, officials said Wednesday. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investigators said one of the sets of remains, found at <LOCATION> Lang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Son </LOCATION> <LOCATION> province </LOCATION> bordering <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, was found buried with the remains of Vietnamese and probably is not American. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team leader, said searchers found areas where other remains might be buried and recovered pieces of aircraft wreckage. They finished their eight-day search through five provinces near <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> on Tuesday. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> specialists left Wednesday for <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, but planned to return to <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> on Friday to discuss their findings and the possibility of more joint work, including excavations of crash sites. The teams trekked through steep leech-infested mountains in pouring monsoon rains to reach sites where six airmen were shot down during the war, which ended in 1975. They interviewed villagers who witnessed the crashes. Villagers led investigators to two sets of remains, in <LOCATION> Lang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Son </LOCATION> and Ha Nam Ninh provinces, said <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Can </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s Office For Seeking Missing Personnel Can said the remains will be given to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after preliminary analysis by Vietnamese forensic experts. He said <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> does not have equipment for identifying the teeth, the key part of both sets of remains. The six airmen were downed while on bombing missions from 1965 to 1967, Can said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said some of the airmen were believed to have survived the crash but there was no evidence they remain alive. `` In all the places, we talked to people who witnessed the crashes, but none of them reported seeing any live airmen'' involved in the six cases, <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> said villagers turned over pieces of wreckage when they heard the Americans were searching the area. The teams used metal detectors to locate areas where possible wreckage was covered over, he said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bombers struck <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> beginning in March 1965 and over the next four years dropped more than 605,000 tons of bombs. The joint project was a breakthrough because it was the first time <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> allowed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> experts to probe the countryside and because it may resolve some cases <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> considers top priority among the 1,757 missing in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. The six airmen are among 70 `` discrepancy cases'' that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says Vietnamese authorities should have information on. Such cases include airmen the communists captured but never returned after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces withdrew from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in 1973. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s Foreign Minister <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Co </PERSON> <PERSON> Thach </PERSON> said Tuesday that <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> agreed in principle to many more joint investigations over the next two months. The two countries agreed on the joint work in June, but <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> suspended cooperation after criticizing <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for refusing to take the first steps to establish diplomatic relations. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> previously allowed only one joint field project, the excavation of a B-52 bomber outside <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> in late 1985. Can said the Americans paid all costs of the latest joint investigation and provided a computer and vehicles to help in the operation.

<HEAD>White House Denies Reagan Signed Order Authorizing Assassinations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The White House denied Wednesday that intelligence authorizations signed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in the mid-1980s gave <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agents latitude to use assassinations in the fight against terrorism. But chief spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> acknowledged that language in two intelligence findings in 1984 and 1985 subsequently was rescinded by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, though he would n't say why. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s spokesman took strong exception to a <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> report Wednesday which said phrasing in the earlier documents amounted to a `` license to kill'' for intelligence agents. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> suggested that the Post story was an attempt to embarrass the administration during the election campaign. But he stopped short of saying precisely that, telling reporters to `` make your own judgment.'' `` I think this is an extraordinary cheap shot. It's not true,'' he said. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>'s harsh statements at the daily <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> news briefing mirrored comments he made Sept. 28, 1987 on a book by <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON>, assistant managing editor of The Post for investigative reporting, entitled `` VEIL: The Secret Wars of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>.'' The book among other things described intelligence findings signed by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1984 and 1985 which contained language interpreted by some in the administration as providing a means for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spies to make an end run around a 1981 <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> executive order flatly prohibiting assassinations. On September 1987, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, responding to the revelations in <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON>'s book, said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` was never aware of ... never authorized ... any assassination efforts.'' On Wednesday, he said, `` This an old story being rehashed again, interestingly timed, but has no foundation.'' <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON> was a co-author of the story that appeared in Wednesday's editions of The Post. The authorizations `` deemed'' as lawful any covert actions _ including potentially violent ones _ taken in `` good faith'' by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence agents against terrorists, according to the report. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> denied that the intelligence findings could have been construed as sanctioning assassination in attempts to combat worldwide terrorism. `` I'm not going to give you a specific definition ... -LRB- of the phrasing in question -RRB- because I do n't know and ... because we would n't discuss it anyway,'' he said. `` But the purpose was to authorize counterintelligence activities to counter terrorism.'' `` The point is they did not authorize assassinations, period,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> added. `` Because there's an executive order in effect that said they did n't. Because the president said they did n't.'' `` It was rescinded when a new terrorism finding was made in May of 1986. It was omitted, but I do n't know why. And then when they -LRB- intelligence findings -RRB- were all reviewed again in May of'87, it was firmly and specifically omitted.'' The Post story said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed intelligence authorizations in both 1984 and 1985 giving <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agents broad anti-terrorism powers. It reported that unidentified White House officials said Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would have been given a copy of or would have had access to the findings. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also denied the report Wednesday, saying, `` If we were n't in polite company, I'd tell you what I thought about a report like that. Asked during an appearance in <LOCATION> Littleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, if it were true, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said `` Absolutely not. To circumvent the law against assassinations is absolutely criminal.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed the first finding on Nov. 13, 1984, shortly after his landslide re-election victory, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> report said, because <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials had become frustrated with car-bombings at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> facilities and the taking of American hostages. Congressional intelligence committees were not informed of the crucial language in the findings, the report said. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> denied that Wednesday, saying there had been notification. The authorization was rescinded on April 10, 1985, a month after a car bomb exploded, killing 80 people in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> near the residence of a leader of one faction of Iranian fundamentalists. The second authorization which included similar language was signed by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Aug. 11, 1985, two months after the highjacking of <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> Flight 847 in which <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> was killed. The intelligence panels were briefed after the signing of the second finding, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said.

<HEAD>Environment Group Sues Government to Halt CFC Production</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An environmental group said Wednesday it had sued the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> seeking to force it to order a complete end to the use of chemicals that destroy the earth's protective ozone layer. The suit by the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> challenges the adequacy of the partial cutbacks that <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> ordered for five major chlorofluorocarbon compounds, or <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION>'s, on Aug. 1. Those regulations paralled provisions of the 1987 treaty by major producing nations pledging themselves to a 50 percent reduction in <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> output by 1998. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> last week said new analyses show that the 50 percent cut will not protect the ozone layer high in the stratosphere and the chemicals in question should be phased out. The ozone layer reduces the amount of cancer-causing ultraviolet rays from the sun that reach the earth's surface. The <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> compounds, normally inert, rise through the atmosphere to the ozone layer, where those same ultraviolet rays break them apart and free chlorine to destroy the ozone. <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION>'s are used as refrigeration fluids, solvents and plastic foam blowing agents. Many countries still permit their use as aerosol propellants, a use banned in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1978. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the single largest contributor to world-wide emissions of ozone-depleting chemicals,'' responsible for about 30 percent of global use, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Doniger </PERSON>, an attorney for the council. `` We have a responsibility to clean up our own house.'' <PERSON> Doniger </PERSON> argued that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` leads best when it leads by example.'' He said the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> could pressure other countries to follow suit by banning imports of products made with <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION>'s unless the importing country also was committed to ending CFC use. He said <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s refusal to go beyond the treaty in its regulations `` appears to reflect a deal struck within the administration last summer'' to placate a faction that believed no treaty was necessary. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Doniger </PERSON>'s `` notion of a deal is untrue and silly.'' `` Our goal all along has been to get the nations of the world to the table and agree to the deepest reductions we could possibly get,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. `` We feel only a global solution will truly help the ozone layer,'' and unilateral <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> action could be counterproductive by leading other nations to conclude they could safely increase their use of <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION>'s as a result, <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. The suit was filed in the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Stipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON> called for a shake-up in the ruling Politburo and the policy-setting <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> after weeks of ethnic and economic protests, state-run media said Wednesday. About 5,000 workers marched on Parliament on Wednesday for the second straight day. Workers have stepped up strikes and demonstrations over the communist government's failure to reduce 217 percent inflation and unemployment, which is at 15 percent. Radio Belgrade said 140,000 Serbs attended two rallies in central <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> to push demands for greater Serbian control over the autonomous provinces of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION>, where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs. Thousands more flag-waving Serbs attended a similar rally in <LOCATION> Novi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sad </LOCATION>, 42 miles north of the capital, according to <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Belgrade </ORGANIZATION> and the state-run <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency. Crowd estimates ranged from 30,000 to 80,000. <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON> said Tuesday night that the 162-member <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> probably will vote on personnel changes in the Politburo on Oct. 17 in a session expected to be a major showdown between factions in the party leadership. State newspapers reported his comments Wednesday. He said the Politburo will meet before Oct. 17 `` to determine the criteria of possible responsibility of its members'' for the country's worst economic and political crisis since World War II. `` If it fails in this, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> will assume this role, and anyone who does not win two-thirds of the committee's votes will have to leave the presidium -LRB- Politburo -RRB-,'' he said As the top body of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s only political party, the Politburo is the most powerful institution in the country. It has 23 members, but two resigned last week under mounting criticism. <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON> also said about one-third of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> membership will be changed by the end of the autumn. `` Very soon new people will be brought into the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communists </ORGANIZATION> and its presidium,'' <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON> announced that a similar `` cadre renewal'' was expected in the party leaderships of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s six republics and two autonomous provinces. Yugoslavs have become increasingly vocal in demanding top-level personnel changes. Leaders have been blamed for failing to defuse tensions between the mostly Christian Serbian minority and the largely Moslem Albanian majority in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>. In addition to high inflation and double-digit unemployment, the country has a $ 21 billion foreign debt. Yugoslav and foreign observers believe major personnel changes at the Oct. 17 meeting will be aimed at reducing tensions between different factions within the party. Senior leaders who have been denounced in public and are widely expected to be sacked during or before the meeting include <PERSON> Stane </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolanc </PERSON>, the nation's vice president from <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Josip </PERSON> <PERSON> Vrhovec </PERSON>, a Croatian member in the collective presidency; and several officials from the autonomous provinces of <LOCATION> Vojvodina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>. Among those who expect to emerge victorious from the meeting are hard-line Serbian officials and their supporters, led by the Serbian republic's party boss, <PERSON> Slobodan </PERSON> <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>. <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>, riding a wave of popularity in the largest republic, advocates more central control over the provinces. On Wednesday, for the second straight day, <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> addressed a crowd of angry workers at Parliament and promised reforms. About 5,000 workers booed two other Communist leaders outside <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday. During the TV interview, <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON> rejected suggestions that the introduction of a multiparty system in this single-party state would resolve the crisis. He said that a type of a multiparty system already exists because each of the republics and autonomous provinces has its own communist party, but that the system does not work.

 A 3-year-old girl who tumbled into a sewer opening survived by holding on to a pipe and bobbing for 45 minutes in 10-foot-deep water until rescue crews arrived, authorities said. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Tong </PERSON> apparently fell into the 18-foot-deep opening while playing with a friend at a construction site near her home Tuesday evening. A woman who had been horseback riding in the area discovered the child. `` She was a real trooper,'' said <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Winstead </PERSON>, who called for help and talked to the girl to keep her calm. The young girl complained of being cold, but appeared to be uninjured in the fall, said fire rescue spokesman <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Doolittle </PERSON>. The opening was about 4 to 5 feet in diameter. To keep her head above water, the child, who fell in at about 7 p.m., wrapped her arms around a 10-inch diameter pipe, Ms. <PERSON> Winstead </PERSON> said. `` I told her to hang on,'' she said, adding, `` I did n't know the water was that deep.'' Rescue crews lowered a ladder into the opening and climbed down to get her. `` She was very lucky. She could have easily drowned,'' <PERSON> Doolittle </PERSON> said Wednesday. The child was examined at <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and released to her parents. `` She's doing fantastic.

<HEAD>Woman Gulps Pills At Foreclosure Hearing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A woman gulped pills in an apparent suicide attempt during a break in a foreclosure proceeding where she risked losing a dairy farm that has been in the family for at least four generations, authorities said. `` Just about everything bad that could happen to people happened to these people,'' attorney <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakles </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said Wednesday of <PERSON> Ida </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Depta </PERSON> and her family. `` The woman got caught up in such a feeling of hopelessness.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Depta </PERSON>, 48, of <PERSON> Alverton </PERSON> took the prescription pills from two bottles in front of other people in a courthouse hallway Tuesday afternoon. `` That tells me she was n't so much trying to kill herself as she was asking for help,'' said <PERSON> Nakles </PERSON>, who represents the estate of Mrs. <PERSON> Depta </PERSON>'s late mother, <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowser </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Depta </PERSON> remained in <LOCATION> Westmoreland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. Officials withheld her condition and other details at the family's request. <PERSON> Nakles </PERSON> said he did not know what kind of pills she swallowed. The incident occurred in the <LOCATION> Westmoreland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Courthouse </LOCATION>, where negotiations were under way to settle an attempt by <ORGANIZATION> ITT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to foreclose on the family's 100-acre dairy farm in southwestern <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. The lender sued in 1985, claiming Mrs. <PERSON> Bowser </PERSON> and the Deptas defaulted on a $ 111,000 loan secured by the farm's 1984 estimated market value of $ 220,000. Mrs. <PERSON> Bowser </PERSON>, who died in August, had diabetes and was nearly blind, <PERSON> Nakles </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Depta </PERSON> `` stated to us that all she wants is to join her mom at the cemetery,'' said Deputy Sheriff <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON>. `` She's just upset over her mom, her brother is dying of cancer, and the possible loss of the farm.'' Witnesses said the Deptas' 18-year-old daughter was able to pull some of the pills from her mother's mouth. Misfortunes at the farm caused some of the Deptas' money problems. Eighteen dairy cows died of an udder disease, and the Deptas were forced to have water hauled to their cattle after the farm's well was fouled around the time a gas well was drilled nearby, <PERSON> Nakles </PERSON> said In addition, Mrs. <PERSON> Depta </PERSON>'s husband, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, was unable to work because of neck, back, shoulder and leg injuries from an auto accident in 1984, according to court documents. <PERSON> Depta </PERSON> also was treated for depression that year.

<HEAD>Report Says Doctors Can Do More To Help Incontinence Sufferers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Ten million Americans suffer from urinary incontinence and most could be helped if doctors would apply proven treatments in more cases, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> committee concluded Wednesday. `` We're not talking about rocket science here,'' said Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON>, chairman of the 15-member consensus development panel. `` This is something we can do tomorrow.'' The committee report calls for family physicians to pay more attention to incontinence problems in their elderly patients and educate themselves about threatment. It also urges patients to be more assertive in expecting adequate treatment if they are incontinent. And it called for more research into the causes of incontinence, a field the experts said has largely been overlooked in the quest for answers to more exotic medical ailments. Their fundamental point, however, was that the existing treatments often do not get to the people who need them because of a widespread and erroneous belief, even by many doctors, that incontinence is a natural consequence of aging. `` This is an issue we can no longer neglect,'' <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON> said at a news conference wrapping up the panel's three-day meeting. `` Most cases can be cured or improved.'' He said more than half of those suffering from the problem are not even evaluated, let alone treated. <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON>, a professor from <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sinai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, offered this hypothetical remark from doctor to incontinent patient as all too familiar: `` Well, what do you expect, my dear. After all, you are 82.'' He said the patient should reply: `` I expect to get responsible, adequate medical care.'' One specific recommendation was for legislation requiring the manufacturers of adult diapers to carry a label message emphasizing that most incontinence is treatable and that anyone suffering from it should get a full medical evaluation. `` Many people with incontinence turn prematurely to the use of absorbent materials without having their difficult properly diagnosed and treated,'' the report said. There are several treatments for the various causes of incontinence, which is defined in the report as `` a symptom rather than a disease.'' The condition can be treated with drugs, surgery or behavioral techniques, which include exercises and biofeedback.

What would he try to accomplish in the debate? he was asked. `` Win,'' he replied. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> spoke by telephone with <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` We had a good visit,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said, adding that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' advice was to `` just be myself.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> planned a reunion Thursday at a steel plant rally near <LOCATION> Longview </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> on Tuesday night after four days of intense preparations, first in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and then in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. He took time to spend with his wife and three children and planned to work out in the hotel gym to help him relax before the debate. B.A. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> accompanied her husband to the private tour of the debate site Wednesday afternoon. Afterward, according to press secretary <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, 67, picked up his wife and carried her off the stage. `` She looked like she was willing to go with him anywhere,'' he said. Much of his preparation was devoted to making <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> comfortable with the format of the debate, which limited the candidates to two-minute answers and one-minute responses, aides said. `` It's a matter of taking the language of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and putting it in a form that's suitable for television,'' <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON> said. Although his advisers admitted helping <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> `` frame his answers,'' <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON> said, `` we have not armed him with a lot of cute one-liners. That's not really his style.'' `` I think we'll leave the one-liners to <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Ailes </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dach </PERSON>, referring to the Republican media strategist who has been coaching the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidate. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and other Democrats have tried to exploit public uneasiness about <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s qualifications for the job, and public polls show <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is a drag on the Republican ticket. A strong performance by the 41-year-old <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> could turn that around. `` I do n't think people are going to judge this just by the fact he does n't stumble,'' <PERSON> Dach </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> needed `` an extremely strong performance'' to overcome the public's doubts.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> decided Wednesday that Rabbi <PERSON> Meir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON>'s anti-Arab <ORGANIZATION> Kach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is racist and can not run in the Nov. 1 parliamentary elections. The party said it would appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The committee acted after the rival <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> parties joined in condemning the American-born rabbi's party as racist and anti-democratic. The committee is made up of members of the <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s parliament, in proportion to each party's representation In another development, Attorney General <PERSON> Yosef </PERSON> <PERSON> Harish </PERSON> said there was insufficient evidence for him to investigate charges that <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> bugged <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> headquarters, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> reported. Kach member <PERSON> Rahamim </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, who defended his party before the committee, said: `` This was a political lynching. I personally feel the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> will cancel this decision.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has upheld disqualification of a political party only once, in 1965 when it ruled against a party called Socialist List whose members allegedly belonged to an outlawed group pledged to destruction of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. In 1984, it overruled an <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> decision to disqualify Kach, which had won a <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION> seat, occupied by <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON>, in the 1984 election. After that committee decision, the <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION> passed a law barring racist parties from running for office. The Kach platform calls for expulsion of the 2.2 million Arabs living in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Committee members voted 28-5, with three abstentions, to ban Kach. The opposition came from three small religious parties. <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON>, born in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, established the <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> before moving to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and founding Kach, which means `` Thus'' in <LOCATION> Hebrew </LOCATION>. His party's popularity has grown because of anti-Arab sentiment fed by the 10-month-old Palestinian revolt in the occupied lands. Recent polls indicated it could win up to three of the 120 <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION> seats Nov. 1. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Meridor </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> said of the election committee vote: `` This was a difficult decision. We are depriving -LRB- the party -RRB- of a fundamental right.'' Many references were made to the Jews' own past as a persecuted people during the committee debate, which lasted nearly four hours. `` Now that the Jewish people have become the majority, will they treat people as did other nations which lost all semblance of humanity?'' asked <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> of Labor. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> started the same way with the same phrases.'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> denied Kach ideology was racist. `` Our attitudes toward the <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> population do not stem from racist motives but from security considerations, because the <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> population is a hostile population. Orthodox Jewish law obligates every Jew to keep himself apart from the gentiles and not to assimilate.'' <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON> says his party platform is based on Orthodox law.

<HEAD>Senate Paves Way for Approval of International Copyright Pact</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 89-0 approval Wednesday of legislation paving the way for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to join a century-old agreement among 76 nations that grants global copyrights to literary and artistic works. `` Adherence to the convention will greatly benefit the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s subcommittee on patents, copyrights and trademarks `` It will provide the guidelines which govern the copyright regulations between nations.'' Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the panel, agreed. `` Our participation will provide benefits to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> copyright holders and artists.'' The bill would change <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> copyright law, paving the way for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> consent to ratification of the treaty, signed in <LOCATION> Berne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, on Sept. 9, 1886. Ratification will come on a separate vote. The Berne Convention, which has been signed by 76 nations, spells out minimum copyright standards, detailing what is protected and how long the protection lasts. The pact prohibits member nations from discriminating against copyrighted works of other member nations. It also provides for copyright protection to take effect in other countries automatically without the necessity of government formalities, such as providing official notice of a copyright. The chief dispute over the legislation involved how best to protect what are known as `` moral rights'' _ the authority of a writer or artist to guard the integrity of his work against what he thinks are damaging changes or misuse. Artists have generally argued for stiff coverage in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law of moral rights. Critics have said that strong coverage is unnecessary, although they support the idea of protecting the artistic integrity of works. American copyright law does n't cover moral rights. The Berne Convention requires signing nations to protect in law the right of an artist to ensure the integrity of his work. However, that protection does n't have to be part of copyright law. The bill approved Wednesday sidesteps that issue, providing that neither the measure nor adherence to the Berne Convention expands or contracts a copyright holder's rights to object to any change in a protected work.

<HEAD>Lawyer Questions Constitutionality of New Sentencing System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A lawyer urged the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday to strike down a new sentencing system for people convicted of federal crimes, saying, `` Judges are supposed to stay out of political controversies.'' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> attacked federal sentencing rules that took effect last Nov. 1 because the seven-member commission that issued them included three federal judges. Judges participating in a political process `` that could fairly be called horse-trading'' is unconstitutional because it impugns the federal judiciary's neutrality and impartiality, <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> argued. The job of passing laws about sentences for federal crimes belongs to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and not to judges, <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> said. But Solicitor General <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Fried </PERSON>, the government's top courtroom lawyer, called the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Sentencing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'s work a constitutionally acceptable attempt to resolve `` grave, invidious and inexplicable disparities in the sentencing process.'' At issue is the validity of the commission, created by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and the validity of the sentencing rules it issued. More than 90 federal trial judges have refused to use the new sentencing rules, declaring them and the commission unconstitutional. But at least 60 of their colleagues have upheld the system, imposing sentences under the new rules. By the time the justices announce their decision, expected by July, thousands of defendants will be subject to resentencing _ regardless of which way the court rules. If the justices uphold the system, those defendants sentenced by judges who refused to apply the new rules will have to be resentenced. If the justices invalidate the system, those defendants sentenced under the new rules will have to be resentenced. The commission estimated that by Jan. 1, more than 10,000 federal court defendants will have been subjected to the new sentencing system. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> created the commission in the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, legislation aimed at eliminating what some called unjustified disparities in sentences. The law empowers the commission _ with its members appointed to six-year terms by the president _ to tell federal judges what sentences should be imposed for various crimes. The rules generally stiffened the prison time federal convicts were required to serve. They also eliminated parole and curtailed credit for good behavior. <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, representing a man who pleaded guilty in federal court to conspiring to possess and distribute cocaine, argued that `` the laying down of broad rules causes -LRB- the three commission member -RRB- judges to be embroiled in political controversy.'' `` Judges appointed for life must maintain their neutrality and impartiality,'' <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said. Fried acknowledged that having judges serve on the commission raises certain `` policy concerns,'' but said those concerns `` have no grounding as constitutional prohibitions.'' Several members of the court, most persistently Justices <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON>, asked Fried questions that appeared to challenge his assertion of the commission's constitutionality. Representing the commission, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bator </PERSON> said the constitutionally required separation of the political branches does not bar <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from establishing an independent agency to make laws about sentencing. He said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> could give the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> the same authority over federal sentencing without any constitutional violation. The test case before the justices stems from the prosecution of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mistretta </PERSON>, who pleaded guilty to conspiring to possess and distribute cocaine after his arrest last year in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Before <PERSON> Mistretta </PERSON>'s sentence was imposed, he challenged the new sentencing rules. A trial judge dismissed the challenge and sentenced <PERSON> Mistretta </PERSON> to 18 months in prison, to be followed by a three-year term of supervised release. <PERSON> Mistretta </PERSON> then appealed to the 8th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, but the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> granted Fried's request that it decide the constitutional issue while the case is pending before the appeals court. The case is <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vs. <PERSON> Mistretta </PERSON>, 87-1904.

 A man charged with taking more than 110 students and teachers hostage at a school Feb. 2 questioned jurors himself as his trial on 110 counts of kidnapping opened under extraordinary security. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>, 43, of <LOCATION> Tuscaloosa </LOCATION>, served as his own attorney during jury selection. A pool of 65 potential jurors awaited questioning. Those entering the courtroom had to pass through metal detectors, and <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Chief Deputy Sheriff <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Norment </PERSON> said 17 deputies were on hand to protect the 104 schoolchildren subpoenaed as witnesses by <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>. Dressed in a light blue suit with a dark blue tie, <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> brought his legal papers into the courtroom in a brown grocery sack Wednesday. He laid a red-covered Bible on the defense table, where he sat by himself. He won the right to represent himself on Monday after promising not to disrupt the trial. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> is accused in a 12-hour takeover of the private <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> End </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tuscaloosa </LOCATION>. Armed with two pistols and a rifle and wearing ski masks, <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> and another man entered the school and held 110 students and teachers hostage, saying he was trying to draw attention to the nation's homeless and hungry. No one was injured. The standoff ended with <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> surrendering after viewing a bogus pardon videotaped by Gov. Guy Hunt. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> has been held on $ 8.4 million bail. If convicted, he could be sentenced to more than 10,000 years in prison. Charges were later dropped against the other man, who police said was forced to participate. Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Karrh </PERSON> ordered the trial moved to <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION> about 160 miles away because of publicity. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> asked prospective jurors whether they knew anyone connected with what he called `` the incident,'' whether they believed in the presumption of innocence for a defendant, whether they had any relatives in law enforcement and whether they believed in statute law vs. `` the constitutional law _ the moral law that we live under in a society.'' District Attorney <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> asked prospective jurors whether they would automatically consider someone insane `` just because he committed an illogical crime.'' None said they would. The prosecution subpoenaed no children, instead summoning officers, reporters, the school's headmaster and teachers. Hunt, who was subpoenaed by <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>, will testify Friday. A Hunt spokeswoman, <PERSON> Stacy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rimer </PERSON>, said the governor made it plain to <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> the day of the takeover that he had no power to grant a pardon. `` He always felt he did what was right because the lives of all those students and teachers were at stake,'' she said.

 A mother raccoon and her two babies who fell through a library ceiling were back in their attic nest Wednesday after spending a day browsing through the reference section. The drop-in visitors, discovered Monday night when they set off a burglar alarm, forced officials to close the library branch near here Tuesday. A sheriff's deputy answering the alarm discovered the curious family sitting on a desk among the literary reference books, somewhere between Greek and Latin authors and the `` Critical Survey of Long Fiction.'' `` They seem to prefer history and the reference department,'' said circulation manager <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Rouse </PERSON>. `` They read a better class of literature than the average person.'' The animals apparently had been nesting in the library for some time before breaking through the ceiling tiles. On Tuesday night, animal control officials put a ladder covered with burlap up to the hole in the ceiling to entice the mother, in part because they believed she might have other babies still in the roof. The strategy worked, and on Wednesday the library was open again with the presumably well-informed raccoons roaming above the ceiling, Ms. <PERSON> Rouse </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 A proposal to ban the mailing of germs and dangerous toxins has drown vigorous opposition, Assistant Postmaster General <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Heselton </PERSON> said Wednesday. As a result, final action on the ban has been postponed until the issue can be more fully studied, <PERSON> Heselton </PERSON> reported to a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee. And, <PERSON> Heselton </PERSON> said, the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has contacted the federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> for assistance in developing safety standards for hazardous mail. Of 508 comments received after the proposed rule was made public, only seven favored the ban, <PERSON> Heselton </PERSON> said. Opposition, for various reasons, came from doctors, laboratories, colleges and universities, medical centers, pathologists and biologists and state and federal health groups, among others, he said. The plan to exclude germs and toxins from the mail was announced in June in the wake of reports that the military had increased shipments of such items. The action was taken `` to ensure the safety and health of ... customers and employees,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said in announcing the decision. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is concerned that some customers are planning increased use of the mails for sending disease germs or hazardous toxins -LRB- etiologic agents -RRB-.'' Opponents of the restriction contended that there is no record of anyone ever being infected by handling mailed germs or toxins, however. They said the ban would increase the costs of shipping medical materials for testing purposes, possibly slow down such testing and might lead mailers to improperly package and misidentify such items in order to mail them. The <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> does not want to increase medical costs or have a negative impact on medical diagnosis or research, <PERSON> Heselton </PERSON> said, but it must also be able to protect both its employees and the public. `` It may be possible to reduce the risk by reducing the quantity permitted for medical purposes per parcel, and requiring better packaging and more expeditious means of movement in the mail,'' he said. Postal workers in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> last year expressed concern about blood and other medical samples mailed to a laboratory there for testing, when some packages were found leaking. Mail handlers were supplied with gloves, masks and other protective gear at the time, and the packaging for the samples has since been improved. Postal regulations already prohibit the mailing of a variety of items, including strike-anywhere matches, explosives, fuses, many poisons, most flammable liquids and certain chemicals. Many other items, such as corrosives, compressed gases, herbicides, pesticides and certain other poisons, can be mailed only in certain types of packages and in specific quantities.

 This town's casket race is such a `` monumental'' effort, <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Darling </PERSON> says, that it took five years to put together a second one. Now, the caskets and contestants are ready for the race Saturday over a 75-yard obstacle course, said the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Rotary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> in this town of 2,000, about 250 of whom work at <ORGANIZATION> Goodwater </ORGANIZATION>'s three casket manufacturers Darling said each casket will contain one `` live corpse'' borne by six pallbearers who will have to run around two tombstones, through a pit called a grave, over sawdust called grave dust and through cross ties and auto tires. The person in each casket will carry a cup of water in a two-cup measuring container. If an ounce or more is spilled, the team is disqualified. Two first-place prizes are $ 140 and a trophy shaped like a casket. If the two of the 20 or so teams finish in a `` dead heat,'' the prize will be shared. Goodwater's casket manufacturers will provide their wares for the race. `` They are major industries and we want to show appreciation to them,'' said Darling, a pharmacist. As was done before the first race, in 1983, a casket promoting the event is on display at a service station in the heart of town. `` We hold our fall festival every year, but the casket race is such a ` monumental' effort for so many people we could n't ` handle' it every year,'' <PERSON> Darling </PERSON> said He said the town's casket business `` is pretty much booming. People are dying to get one.''

 Legislation to force the recall of lead-lined water coolers and to ban the manufacture of coolers that are not lead-free was passed Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The bill, approved on a voice vote, would give the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Product </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> a year to require manufacturers and importers of lead-lined coolers to either repair, replace or give refunds on such coolers. The proposal would authorize spending $ 90 million through 1992 for a grant program to assist schools to test for lead contamination and replace drinking water plumbing containing lead. The bill also would authorize a three-year, $ 66 million program of technical and grant assistance to detect and prevent lead poisoning of children, who are more susceptible to poisoning than adults.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> unveiled the cornerstone of the Holocaust Memorial Museum on Wednesday and challenged the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to relax its restrictions on Jewish emigration, saying, `` Let these people go.'' `` In these days of glasnost, we hear talk of liberalizing attitudes toward Judaism in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' the president told about 1,500 people gathered in a tent at the museum site near the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Monument. But he said `` there are still tens of thousands, maybe even hundreds of thousands'' of Jews waiting to leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` And here, as we lay this cornerstone and vow that the Jewish people will never stand alone against tyranny, I want to ask the Soviet leaders a question: Where are those exit visas? Where are they?'' he said. `` You and I and all Americans of good will are united in the challenge I propose to the Soviet leaders today,'' he said. `` I say: let these people go.'' The president, assisted by <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyerhoff </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, chairman of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Holocaust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, pulled a gold cord to reveal the chunk of pink <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> granite that will stand at the corner of the museum. The museum, being built with private funds on land donated by the federal government, is expected to open late in 1990 to commemorate th Holocaust, in which 6 million Jews and other persecuted people were killed in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the museum `` will examine the nature and meaning of the continuing curse that is anti-Semitism.'' `` I think all of us here are aware of those, even among our own countrymen, who have dedicated themselves to the disgusting task of minimizing or even denying the truth of the Holocaust,'' he said. `` This act of intellectual genocide must not go unchallenged and those who advance these views must be held up to the scorn and wrath of all good and thinking people,'' he said. `` We know that the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, whose peacekeepers were honored only last week for their service to the world, has yet to repeal its infamous resolution equating Zionism and racism,'' the president said. `` We know where such intellectual infamy can lead.''

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> accused the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on Wednesday of taking an `` unconstructive approach'' on a proposal by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to expand air links to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. `` They must understand that progress in <LOCATION> East-West </LOCATION> relations can not bypass <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>,'' spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said. She did not say whether the Soviets had actually turned <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> down, but she implied they had. `` The problem has much to do with differing interpretations of the agreement governing the status of the city,'' said another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The president, in a speech at the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> on June 12, 1987, urged the expansion of air service to <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and promotion of more international conferences, youth exchanges and sporting events there. The city, which was the capital of <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in World War II, has been administered since then by the four allied victors: the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. While <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> is now the capital of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the three Western countries keep trying to strengthen ties with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, which is 110 miles inside <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, a Soviet ally. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> has called repeatedly for tearing down the Berlin Wall, which effectively separates East and West. `` We are disappointed by the Soviets' unconstructive approach to the initiative,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said. `` They must understand that progress in <LOCATION> East-West </LOCATION> relations can not bypass <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, and that stability in and around the city can only be maintained over time by taking steps to meet the legitimate aspirations of Berliners for positive change.'' She said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would continue to press for progress on the initiative and its goals. `` I am not going to get into the details of their communication this,'' the spokeswoman said of the Sept. 15 Soviet response. `` Obviously, we feel that it was not forthcoming. But we're going to continue to press them on it.''

 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration on Wednesday urged Soviet authorities to stop using violence to break up peaceful protests in the Baltic republic of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government deplores the recent pattern of systematic violence by the Soviet authorities directed against peaceful demonstrations in <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>,'' said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Justesen </PERSON>. `` The unjustified and unprovoked attacks have injured more than a dozen individuals,'' he said, reading a prepared statement.

The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> statement said that `` in the Sept. 28 demonstration in <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION>, more than 10 persons were injured by police to prevent the non-violent expression of political views.'' `` During the past weeks, organizers of peaceful demonstrations have been injured by unknown persons in attacks believed to be officially sanctioned,'' the statement said. `` We call upon the Soviet authorities to refrain from the use of force against peaceful marchers and to discipline those officials responsible.''

<HEAD>EPA Halts Production of Coyote-Killing Chemical</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it will ban manufacture of the coyote-killing compound used in baited collars for sheep, a move expected to anger ranchers and state officials in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. The agency also said Wednesday that it was ordering a temporary halt to sales of strychnine pesticide products, which are used mainly against field rodents. The agency said it will cancel the federal pesticide license of the only manufacturer of sodium fluoroacetate, known as `` Compound 1080,'' which is put into baited sheep collars. The producer, <ORGANIZATION> Tull </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, failed to provide data requested by <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, agency spokesman <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Heier </PERSON> said. The federal <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Wyoming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Montana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Livestock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ranchers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supply </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Alpine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, have licenses to use and sell the product. All will be permitted to continue distributing and using them, but they will have to submit safety data on their use to EPA. Agency spokesman <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Heier </PERSON> said the collar's users `` are going to have to work like heck to get an alternate supply of the chemical.'' <PERSON> Heier </PERSON> said another manufacturer could attempt to win a license by providing the information the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> wants. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> also said it was suspending all licenses for use of Compound 1080 against rodents, in which it is dispersed in pellets. The <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> administration banned the use of Compound 1080 in 1972, after its widespread use in baited carcasses by ranchers led conservationists to protest that it was killing eagles and other wildlife. But pressure from ranchers prompted <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to reverse itself in 1985 and permit Compound 1080 to be used in closed collars on sheep. Coyotes puncture the collar and ingest fatal doses when they seize sheep by the neck. The agency also announced Wednesday that it was temporarily suspending all licenses for sale of strychnine products. At the same time, the agency said it had temporarily canceled licenses, a more serious action, for sale and above-ground use of all pesticides containing strychnine. This temporary cancelation is effective immediately. The suspension of strychnine products would halt the sale, but not the use, of the pesticide. The temporary cancellation of licenses for use of above-ground strychnine halts that product's use, but allows the pesticide to be used below ground The squirrels can devastate otherwise productive land, and the only alternative to strychnine, sometimes applied from the air, is manual application of poisonous phosgene gas in below-ground burrows. Most strychnine licenses are held by state and local governments in the West and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The strychnine temporary cancellation complies with the order of a federal court in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> issued in April requiring the agency to halt above-ground use while it developed means to protect non-target species. The agency has appealed the order but has lost a request for a stay. The suspensions are the result of failure of state and local governments to provide <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> with safety data, <PERSON> Heier </PERSON> said. Except for the strychnine temporary cancellation, all the actions are effective in 30 days unless license holders request hearings. If those hearings are held, the products may still be used.

 Hundreds of youths rioting against inflation virtually took over the capital's central district Wednesday, setting cars ablaze and breaking shop windows while police looked on, witnesses reported. The rioters, mostly schoolboys and university students, were protesting a constantly increasing cost of living and consequent reductions in real wages. <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> has been hit by several strikes recently and new ones were reported Wednesday at the offices of the carrier <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Algerie </ORGANIZATION>, the post office and in various industries. Gangs of several hundred youngsters were seen overturning cars and setting them afire on the main shopping streets, <PERSON> Didouche </PERSON> <PERSON> Mourad </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> M'Hidi </PERSON>. They broke windows of shops and government-owned department stores and attacked the information office of the Polisario independence movement of the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION>. Glass littered the streets for well over a mile. One group of rioters stopped a bus, made the driver get out and then broke all the windows, witnesses reported. The offices of the West German airline <ORGANIZATION> Lufthansa </ORGANIZATION> and the Czechoslovak airline CSA were wrecked, as were many shops that did not get their metal curtains down quickly. At the <ORGANIZATION> Lufthansa </ORGANIZATION> office, counters were overturned, reservation computers ripped out and documents scattered in the street. Rioters also invaded libraries, cafes and restaurants. A nightclub called `` Blue Note'' was destroyed. About 100 young rioters brought bottles from inside the club and used them as projectiles. Others carried the furniture from the government's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publicity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and set fire to it front of the central post office. Security forces did little to stop the rampage, but several vehicles carrying riot police with tear gas launchers took positions at midday around the main Air Algerie office near the lower end of <LOCATION> Didouche </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mourad </LOCATION>. It office was not damaged. Young people were seen hurling stones at small groups of police in side streets. Workers who struck an auto parts factory in late September said they had not had a raise in years. Their strike led to a confrontation with police. Employees of the plant earn the equivalent of $ 270 - $ 330 a month while many prices have soared because of new government economic policies intended to `` rationalize consumption'' and encourage production Bread is subsidized and still sells for about 17 cents, but beef costs nearly $ 12 a pound. Strikers and protesters also complain of shortages. Butter, for example, has not been available for about a month. President <PERSON> Chadli </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON> says the reforms are necessary but his government announced Tuesday in conjunction with the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Algerian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, the country's only labor union, that an effort would be made to provide more staples at lower prices.

Laotian authorities on Sunday arrested <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, 45, of <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Copp </PERSON>, 43, a Vietnam War veteran from <LOCATION> Hampstead </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, after they crossed the <LOCATION> Mekong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in a rented boat and landed in a village in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>. The river forms the boundary with <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, then flows to <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. The six, four of whom are <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> War veterans, have said they hope to trace <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> prisoners of war they believe are still being held in the communist countries of <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. `` We call <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> the black hole of the MIA issue,'' said committee chairman <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Sampley </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beret </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C </LOCATION>. The other members of the group are <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> veteran of the Vietnam War; <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Hampton </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Winter </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, who served in the war as a nurse; and <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, a dentist from <LOCATION> Laramie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo </LOCATION>. On Thursday, the four plan to travel to the northeastern <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Ubon </LOCATION> and drop $ 2,000 into the <LOCATION> Mekong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> at the same spot from which their colleagues left for <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>. Long and <PERSON> Copp </PERSON> carried about $ 3,000 as well as other currency they planned to drop into the river or give to Laotian villagers. Each dollar bill was stamped with the reward offer and wrapped in a plastic bag. The members of the new expedition, who say they will not attempt to cross the <LOCATION> Mekong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, said Long and <PERSON> Copp </PERSON> had apparently `` gone above and beyond what we asked them to do.'' `` We're not Rambo types. We did not come over here in any kind of militant mode,'' said <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, whose brother <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> was declared missing in action in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> 22 years ago. `` I do n't want my brother's bones back I want the flesh and blood that goes with the man.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government lists 2,393 Americans as missing in action in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. The three governments deny holding any live Americans. But the group, which claims the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has neglected the issue, says it's convinced there are still American POWs in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> based on reports by refugees of having seen Americans, and other evidence. <PERSON> Sampley </PERSON> said the money the group brought with them was pledged by 21 congressmen, private individuals and corporate donors. The group of six were to have traveled together, <PERSON> Sampley </PERSON> said, but airline reservations problems forced Long and <PERSON> Copp </PERSON> to arrive in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> before the others. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Petzing </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, said Tuesday that Long and <PERSON> Copp </PERSON> were being held at Ban Sing <PERSON> Samphan </PERSON> in the southern <LOCATION> Laotian </LOCATION> province of <LOCATION> Champasak </LOCATION>. He could not confirm whether they were still in the village or had been moved to the capital, <LOCATION> Vientiane </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pornthipa </PERSON> <PERSON> Vajarabukka </PERSON>, a Thai hotel manager, said she visited Long and <PERSON> Copp </PERSON> on Tuesday in a small house in the village, but was not allowed to speak to them. She said authorities told her Monday the two would be released within three days. <PERSON> Pornthipa </PERSON> added that she felt responsible for Long and <PERSON> Copp </PERSON> _ who speak neither <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> nor Lao _ because the Americans had contacted the hotel before their trip across the river. It was not known if Long and <PERSON> Copp </PERSON> had floated money down the river, and details of how they were arrested were not available. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> official in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Wednesday that the Laotian government has not responded to an official query about the two Americans.

<HEAD>U.N. Sources Say Iran Agrees To Stop Searching Ships In Persian
Gulf</HEAD>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has agreed to stop searching ships in international waters of the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> which it suspects of carrying war cargo to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, sources in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, also said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> agreed to postpone discussing ownership of the disputed Shatt-al-Arab waterway, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s only outlet to the gulf. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has a long gulf coastline with numerous ports. Breakthroughs on these two issues could help end the stalemate in the <LOCATION> Iran-Iraq </LOCATION> peace talks that began Aug. 25 in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. The two neighbors in the oil-rich gulf, at war for eight years, agreed on Aug. 20 to a U.N.-sponsored truce. The sources said <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> proposed the compromises during talks that began last week with the foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Those talks ended Wednesday. Under the proposals, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> will no longer stop vessels flying a neutral flag in international gulf waters and the <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> consented to discuss its claims to <PERSON> Shatt-al-Arab </PERSON> later in the negotiations, the sources said. Both parties will begin arranging a withdrawal of their forces to the internationally recognized border and will discuss repatriation of prisoners of war, they added. No announcement of the compromise will be issued until peace talks resume in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> later this month because <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> wants to wait and see if <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> honors the agreement, the sources said. In addition, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> and the Iranian and <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> diplomats agreed not to discuss details of their talks while progress is being made in negotiations between their lower-ranked representatives. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s insistence that <PERSON> Shatt-al-Arab </PERSON> be cleared of sunken ships and dredged to remove silt has blocked progress in the talks. To be taken up later in the peace talks is the issue of whether both nations share rights to the waterway under a 1975 treaty or whether <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has sovereignty over the whole passage and both its banks, the sources reported. <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> also complained that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s searching of ships for Iraq-bound war cargo violated a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolution calling for the parties to `` discontinue all military activities on land, at sea and in the air.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> held that searching for war cargo was a right that nations at war generally are recognized to have. The Iran-Iraq war broke out in September 1980 when <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> forces invaded western <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> after weeks of border skirmishes. More than 1 million casualties are estimated to have resulted from the war.

 <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> marked the 15th anniversary of the last <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war Wednesday with its first military parade since President <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> was assassinated in 1981. President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>'s vice president and successor, watched from an elevated viewing box. On Oct. 6, 1981, <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> stood beside <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> when Moslem extremists bolted from a truck and sprayed the ground-level reviewing stand with bullets that felled the president. <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> and seven others died in attack led by an army lieutenant. Twenty-eight people were wounded, but <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> was unhurt. On Wednesday, only <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>, his ministers, diplomats and other officials were allowed into the suburban <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> to watch the parade, which was televised and broadcast on radio. Earlier, <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> laid a wreath at <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>'s tomb and that of <PERSON> Gamal </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON>, leader of the 1952 coup that ended the Egyptian monarchy. <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> was an army lieutenant colonel in <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON>'s Free Officers, who were responsible for the coup. In a videotaped speech broadcast before the wreath-laying, <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> as a hero for engineering the surprise attack on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> that began the 1973 war and for signing a peace treaty with the Jewish state six years later. Wednesday's parade mainly celebrated the military exploits of the 1973 conflict. In <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>'s time, the annual military parade would fill one of metropolitan <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>'s largest streets with tanks, artillery and men. In Wednesday's parade, tanks, missiles and other heavy weapons passed the reviewing stand on truck-drawn trailers. Since <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>'s death, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s annual commemoration of the 1973 war has been limited to a televised speech by <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> on Oct. 6, the anniversary of the capture of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> positions in the occupied <LOCATION> Sinai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> that constituted <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s only success in four wars with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. No explanation was given for either the decision to have a parade this year or moving the celebration forward a day. The Oct. 6 parade became a tradition under <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>, who watched the displays dressed in a resplendent military uniform. On the day he died, <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> wore a white, gold-braided uniform with high boots. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>, a former fighter pilot, was dressed in an air force uniform on that day. It was his last public appearance in military uniform. On Wednesday, he wore a blue suit and mirrored sunglasses.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Cautions Romania's Ceausescu on Maverick Policies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> cautioned visiting Romanian leader <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> on Wednesday that his maverick policies may discredit socialism and the entire <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who has headed the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> since 1985, said, `` The notion of socialism will be formed on the basis of evaluating the combined experience of socialist nations. The success of each of them will be a common ideological achievement. But the failure of any can, alas, mean a common setback too.'' In reply, <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> lauded the `` traditions of cooperation and revolutionary solidarity'' between his country and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but asserted <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s right to chart its own political course. `` One should always bear in mind the fact that the revolutionary process is unfolding in each country in different conditions,'' <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, who heads <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said. Their remarks at a <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> luncheon were reported by the official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, accompanied by his wife <PERSON> Elena </PERSON> and by Romanian officials, arrived in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Tuesday for talks with the Soviets. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> has balked at following <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s social and economic reform program, known by its Russian-language name of `` perestroika'' or restructuring. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> noted that `` all the socialist countries have their own distinctive features,'' but said common action by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and its allies was necessary. `` It is the initiative and identity shown by each fraternal country in its contribution to achieving the objectives of their concerted policies that broaden the range of socialism's influence on international processes,'' he said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also made a pitch for his own economic, political and social reforms, which he said were becoming part of Soviet life, although not as fast as had been hoped. `` We see this as the best proof that perestroika will definitely succeed,'' he said. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> has stirred a storm of protest in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and elsewhere over his plan to raze up to 7,000 villages, including about 800 ethnic Hungarian communities, and resettle the population in so-called agro-industrial centers. <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> has also drawn fire for stalling the 35-nation review Conference on Security and Cooperation in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> over human rights provisions to be included in a final document. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> did not refer directly to those disputes, but mentioned the need for `` respect for the rights and freedoms of each citizen,'' and for `` the observance of legality and of the rule of law.'' On his visit to <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> in May 1987, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> implicitly criticized in a televised speech the nepotism and personality cult <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> promotes in that country. He also demanded higher-quality goods to be delivered from <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, where widespread food and energy shortages make life difficult for the country's 25 million people. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> admitted in a speech Monday that Romanian industry has failed to meet export targets for this year. One issue likely to be discussed during <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s visit is <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s desire to obtain more Soviet crude oil and raw materials in return for Romanian wheat, meat and agricultural products.

 <PERSON> Cher </PERSON>'s boyfriend was charged with reckless driving and malicious mischief Wednesday over a confrontation June 27 in which his car crashed into a photographer's outside the home he shares with the actress. The misdemeanor offenses are less serious than the felony charge of assault with a deadly weapon on which <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Camilletti </PERSON>, 24, was booked. `` There was insufficient evidence of any attempt of assault, based on the statements of witnesses,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Qualls </PERSON>, spokesman for the City Attorney's office. <PERSON> Camilletti </PERSON> was driving <PERSON> Cher </PERSON>'s black Ferrari when it hit a car belonging to <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON>, a photographer for the entertainment tabloid Star. Camilletti was released on $ 2,000 bail. The bagel maker and aspiring actor said he lost control of his car while trying to swerve into the driveway to avoid the photographers. <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Camilletti </PERSON> of trying to kill him and sued the couple for unspecified damages. `` I'm very pleased that the city attorney understood that I never tried to hit the tabloid photographer,'' <PERSON> Camiletti </PERSON> said in a statement. `` It's true that I broke the guy's camera and telephone after the accident, and I intend to reimburse him for that.'' `` With this decision not to file any felony charges, I am now hopeful that <PERSON> Cher </PERSON> and I can get back to some degree of normalcy with our lives,'' <PERSON> Camilletti </PERSON> said. `` I think he should have been charged with assault with a deadly weapon. No, I'm not pleased with these charges,'' said <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON>. `` I guess the city attorney thought it was an accident. But I'm glad they filed something.'' Reckless driving carries up to 90 days in jail and a $ 1,000 fine, and the two counts of malicious mischief could bring up to 18 months in jail and $ 6,000 in fines.

 A fire sparked by a welder's torch spread smoke through three floors of a hospital building Wednesday, forcing the evacuation of about 50 outpatients. No one was injured in the fire, authorities said. The evacuated patients were moved to another hospital building or onto buses, while nurses, doctors and staff waited outside, many of them wrapped in white hospital blankets to fend off the cold and an intermittent drizzle. Only the basement and first and second floors of <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>, the main building of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Memorial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, had to be evacuated, said hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>.

 Explosions damaged two court buildings Wednesday night in suburbs of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, police reported. They said one was hurt in the blast outside <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> and there were no immediate reports of injuries in the <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> explosion. In another development, an organization opposed to the military draft said police put tight restrictions on its leader Wednesday. The first of the two explosions occurred shortly after 7 p.m. at the <ORGANIZATION> Stellenbosch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magistrates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> about 25 miles east of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, police said. The second took place about two hours later at the <ORGANIZATION> Alexandra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magistrates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in a small business district that separates the impoverished black township of <PERSON> Alexandra </PERSON> from affluent white suburbs of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. Police did not give details of damage to either building or the cause of the explosions. At least 148 bombings have taken place in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> since the government declared a nationwide state of emergency June 12, 1986, including a record 29 in September. President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s government has blamed virtually all of them on the the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the main guerrilla group fighting white domination. Anti-apartheid activists suggest, howeer, that recent attacks on anti-apartheid groups and public facilities frequented mostly by blacks were the work of right-wing whites. The End Conscription Campaign said its national secretary, <PERSON> Alastair </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeling-Smith </PERSON>, was ordered not to speak with journalists, prepare material for publication or attend any gathering convened for the purpose of criticizing government policy. He and his organization oppose the mandatory military service required of white South African men. It has appealed unsuccessfully for alternative non-military service for men politically or morally opposed to joining the army. Military service for other race groups is voluntary. <PERSON> Teeling-Smith </PERSON>'s group was banned Aug. 22, three weeks after 143 white males _ including doctors, lawyers and scientists _ publically announced their refusal of military service.

 <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said Wednesday he's not out of the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> picture, even though it appears most of the assets of the television ministry he founded will be bought by a Canadian businessman. `` It's not over till it's over, as I've been saying,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said in front of the new <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Tammy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> about two miles from <LOCATION> Heritage </LOCATION> <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>, site of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s Christian theme park and television studios. `` It seems every few weeks we go through it's been sold again, and sold again. <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s court-appointed trustee, M.C. `` Red'' <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> announced Tuesday he had signed a contract with <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> to buy the ministry's assets for $ 115 million. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> had identified other potential buyers but had not previously gotten to the contract stage. <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, attorney <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kluttz </PERSON> said his client <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> will pay $ 50 million at closing for the deal and pay the $ 65 million balance over five years. <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> has not said what he plans to do with <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>, but wrote in a Sept. 15 letter to <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> that he would consider `` preserving or enhancing the Christian orientation'' even though he is an Orthodox Jew. <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> must sell its assets to pay creditors as soon as possible under an order from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Rufus </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, who left the now crumbling evangelical empire in March 1987 amid a sex-and-money scnadal, said he would not consider the ramifications of a <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> sale `` until I hear the final gavel of the judge.'' `` It still has to be ratified by the judge, by the creditors, and then it's still subject to the condition upon transfer of the satellite contract _ -LRB- which -RRB- is a non-transferrable contract, so that has to be approved,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said. `` Then Mr. <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> has 30 days to just walk away with no penalties, if he wants to,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said. `` That to me is not as strong a deal as I would have liked to have seen, anybody who can just walk away without losing something has a pretty good deal on his side.'' <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> has said other bidders may present offers directly to the bankruptcy court, but he said his recommendation gives <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON>'s offer a strong upper hand <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> is expected to hold a hearing on the sale about a month from now. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> proposed a $ 172 million plan to buy the ministry's assets, but his bid lost credibility last month when he could not come up with a $ 3 million down payment Convinced he still can put together a deal and eventually restore his television ministry, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> has assembled a staff that shares his faith. `` We know <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> will be restored, we just do n't know what route God will use to accomplish that,'' said <PERSON> Lin </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who was answering one of the many phones ringing at the information center. `` And when they get back to <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION>, it will be done in such a way that everybody will know it was done by the hand of God, not by the hand of man,'' Ms. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said. `` God is moving on <PERSON> Jim </PERSON>'s behalf,'' said <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBaron </PERSON>, referring to the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> hoped-for return to television. `` We're really not concerned about Mr. <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON>, we're not upset about it at all,'' said <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Licata </PERSON>. `` It's just an interim thing.''

 A student who failed an economics test twice but made good class grades is suing the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> to either receive a master's degree in business administration or get her $ 5,000 tuition back. `` After paying all my dues and having a good average, I just feel abused,'' said <PERSON> Nora </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, 48. `` I really do n't want their money. I just want what I earned, which is a master's degree.'' The dean of the school's <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> Eubanks </PERSON>, defended the test format that requires students to review all the material they have learned: finance, management, marketing and economics. After passing the three other parts of the test, Mrs. <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> failed the economics section. She hired a tutor, crammed for another semester and took the test again but failed once more. Mrs. <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, who commuted 100 miles round-trip for two years from <LOCATION> Cocoa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> school for classes, filed suit last week with the help of her husband, <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON>, who is a lawyer. She alleged the test is unfair because each of the business school's economics professors hold different theories and place emphasis on different facets of the subject. Her test was prepared by a professor she did not study under and included material she had never studied, she contended. <PERSON> Eubanks </PERSON> said Tuesday the comprehensive test is common at colleges across the country. Most of the school's MBA candidates are part-time students, <PERSON> Eubanks </PERSON> said, and they spend up to five years earning the degree. A comprehensive test ensures that students retain the material they learned at the beginning, he said. <PERSON> Eubanks </PERSON> said it was not uncommon for students to fail the test several times and that Mrs. <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> can take it again.

<HEAD>President Aquino Acknowledges Failure To Solve Nation's Problems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> acknowledged Wednesday at the funeral of a leading critic of her government that her administration had failed to solve the country's problems. She also stressed the need to uplift the lives of poor Filipinos during an emotional eulogy for newspaper publisher <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Roces </PERSON>, who persuaded her to run for office but later rebuked her for her failures. Roces, 75, publisher of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manila </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and a key figure in the struggle to oust former President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, died Friday of cancer. Prominent business and government leaders attended his funeral. After receiving the Legion of Honor from Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> in July, <PERSON> Roces </PERSON> publicly chided her for failing to establish a `` new moral order'' after the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> government fell in February 1986 and she was swept into the presidency. `` It hurt when he said it, but it had to be said,'' the president said, her voice breaking with emotion. `` And he was one with the moral authority to say it. He has warned us that we, the friends of democracy, shall have a worse time of it than the clear enemies of the people if we fail the people.'' The Aquino government has been under fire in the press on charges of corruption, mismanagement and promotion of officials chosen more for loyalty than for merit. The banned <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philippines </ORGANIZATION> sent a statement to news agencies Wednesday hailing <PERSON> Roces </PERSON>' role in anti-Marcos protests and his later criticism of the Aquino government. In a raid Wednesday, police meanwhile arrested Master Sgt. <PERSON> Godofredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamboa </PERSON>, a purported aide of former Lt. Col. <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> `` Gringo'' <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>. A senior officer said investigators were closing in on the elusive <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>, who was arrested in December but escaped from a prison ship in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> in April. Col. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Oxales </PERSON>, deputy military commander of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, told reporters that raiders seized a .45 caliber pistol and ammunition at <PERSON> Gamboa </PERSON>'s home in suburban <LOCATION> Caloocan </LOCATION> city. <PERSON> Gamboa </PERSON>, a former counterintelligence agent, denied involvement in any attempts to topple Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, but <PERSON> Oxales </PERSON> said the sergeant was a `` close contact man'' of <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gamboa </PERSON> faces weapons charges. Wednesday's arrest brought to 74 the number of alleged right-wing figures taken into custody in recent weeks, including key officers of last year's failed coup which left at least 53 dead and more than 300 wounded. <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> played a major role in the military-civilian revolt which toppled <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and propelled Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to office. He grew disillusioned with Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, however, complaining that she failed to crush the communist rebellion, now in its 19th year, and rid the government of corruption.

<TEXT>
 The campaign of Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on Wednesday unveiled four new television ads attacking Republican rival <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for his record on education, environment, drugs and Social Security. Some of the ads, each lasting 30 seconds and dealing with one of those four themes, began airing nationwide Wednesday night, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> media spokeswoman <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> <PERSON> Voles </PERSON> said Wednesday in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. She had no information on how long the ads would run. The ads said the administration dealt secretly with <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, `` the Panamanian drug lord,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` personally'' weakened environmental regulations, `` personally'' cast the tie-breaking vote to cut Social Security'' in 1985 and `` sat by while college loans for working families were cut.'' Three of the ads bore the pro-Dukakis tag line, `` The best <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is yet to come.'' The ads carry lines questioning the sincerity of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s stances and suggesting he has made election-year conversions. `` And now suddenly <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> tells you he's going to be the environmentalist president?'' says one. `` And now suddenly <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says he'll be the education president?'' says another. Ms. <PERSON> Voles </PERSON> said the new ads will be running while a set of four ads dealing with `` the packaging of George'' continues. Those ads depict <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s consultants sitting around a table trying to `` package'' a candidate who has no positions that the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people can support. An earlier ad called `` New Era'' is also airing.

<TEXT>
 In the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> a theft is committed every 40 seconds on the average, one rape every hour and a premeditated murder every 90 minutes, the government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday. <PERSON> Izvestia </PERSON> made the figures public in an article marking the 70th anniversary of the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, in charge of tracking down crime suspects. Under President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s campaign for `` glasnost,'' or openness, more is becoming known about crime _ a subject once virtually taboo in the state-run media. As one example, Radio <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> revealed in March that 9,000 people were murdered in the country in 1987. Extrapolating from the figures printed by <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>, which the paper said came from the <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, 2,160 thefts, 24 rapes and 16 murders take place in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on an average day. On a yearly basis, that would total 788,400 thefts, 8,760 rapes and 5,840 premeditated murders for the nation as a whole. Detailed crime incidence reports are still not made public in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but officials in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> maintain that violent crime is far less of a problem than in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. They cite the small number of privately owned firearms as one major reason.

 A second national poll has found Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> closing on <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the presidential race, although a newer survey released Wednesday gave the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> a slightly better lead. Both surveys found many voters expressing concern about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate, Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> The newer poll, an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> survey conducted from Sept. 28 through Tuesday, put the race at 51-44 percent with the Republicans in the numerical lead. The poll of 1,196 likely voters had an error margin of about four points. In the other survey, a <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> poll conducted last week, the Republicans won support from 49 percent of 1,235 likely voters, to 46 percent for the Democrats. It also was a dead heat, given the three-point margin of error. A Harris poll early last month put the race a bit wider, at 50-44 with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> ahead. Similarly, a <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll released Tuesday put the race at 48-46, tightened from 49-44 later last month. The ABC-Post and <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> polls were released on the night of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s debate with Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the Democratic vice presidential nominee. Like other polls, both found doubts about <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s qualifications for office. In the <ORGANIZATION> ABC-Post </ORGANIZATION> poll, 40 percent said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was qualified to be vice president, but 33 percent said not; the rest did n't know. By contrast, 67 percent said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was qualified and just 7 percent said not. In the Harris poll, conducted Sept. 24-29, only a third believed <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was qualified to be president if that became necessary. When respondents were asked their preference for vice president only, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> beat <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> solidly, 59-37. And voters by 56-25 percent said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had done better than <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at picking a running mate.

 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday dismissed as `` pure fantasy'' an assertion by an Iranian opposition leader that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration secretly negotiated with <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> for the release of American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` There have been no negotiations, no direct contacts between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> officials,'' said spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON>. `` There may be private individuals who misrepresented themselves as speaking on behalf of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. They are not.'' Former Iranian President <PERSON> Abolhassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bani-Sadr </PERSON> said Tuesday in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawless </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, had negotiated on behalf of Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with a representative of Iranian Parliament Speaker <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>. In reply, Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said: `` We have flatly denied anyone is speaking on behalf of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. government.'' Lawless, president of a Washington-based trade investment firm known as U.S.-Asia, denied through a business partner that he had engaged in any talks with Iranians about the hostages. In a statement Lawless relayed through partner <PERSON> Therese </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaheen </PERSON>, he said, `` I categorically deny, and state for the record, that I am involved either directly or indirectly in any discussions or negotiations with any party related to attempts to secure the release of hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' Ms. <PERSON> Shaheen </PERSON> said Lawless can produce passport and charge card travel records that prove he was not in that part of the world during the time that <PERSON> Bani-Sadr </PERSON> says he was involved. Lawless is a former <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> employee who served in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Shaheen </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Times, quoting sources they did not identify, reported Wednesday that <PERSON> Lawless </PERSON> worked for the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> in the 1970s, during the same period <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s national security adviser, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>, served with the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. In addition, The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> quoted an unidentified former government official as saying that <PERSON> Lawless </PERSON> had worked in the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>'s operations directorate until several years ago The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Biographic Register said in its 1974 edition that <PERSON> Lawless </PERSON> had worked as an `` area analyst'' for the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had urged other governments to use their influence to secure the release of the nine Americans held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> by pro-Iranian bands. But she said none of the messages exchanged between the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Iranian governments through other countries dealt specifically with releasing the hostages. `` That would involve dealings, negotiations,'' the spokeswoman said. `` There have been no negotiations on this issue.'' Asked if Lawless or any other private individual had negotiated with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said: `` I do n't know of anybody who has done that. But that does n't exclude the possibility that there may be somebody out there, as we speak, who says ` I'm speaking for the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. government.' I ` m just trying to be very prudent and cautious. But I do n't know of any names of anyone who is doing this.'' She added: `` Only <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government officials are authorized to speak on this matter, and none have.'' Her immediate comment on <PERSON> Bani-Sadr </PERSON>'s assertions were two blunt words: `` Pure fantasy.'' With the arrival of <PERSON> Mithileshwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, a freed Indian hostage, at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military hospital in <LOCATION> Wiesbaden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and a lack of indications the nine Americans would be released, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> task force set up Monday to deal with the situation was disbanded Tuesday evening. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, talking to reporters, said he has heard nothing to indicate other hostages might soon be set free. `` We desperately are hoping, continuing to try,'' he said. But he also said, `` I've never been able to explain ... the Iranians, what their strategies are and what they do. But obviously we could not do any negotiating with them unless and until the hostages are released.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, a legal <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> resident, would travel to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after a thorough medical examination in <LOCATION> Wiesbaden </LOCATION>, but his plans had not jelled. She said a preliminary checkup in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, where he had been taken by Syrian forces after his release Monday in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, confirmed he had `` previously known problems'' of diabetes, hypertension and possible coronary artery disease and had lost a considerable amount of weight and muscle mass during his 20-month captivity. `` He was treated with appropriate medicines, is in good spirits and has traveled well,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said of the 60-year-old chairman of the business administration department at the <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> had been held by the Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>. Nine Americans, three Britons, an Irishman, an Italian and a Belgian remain in captivity in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Office for Counter-Terrorism. Three of the Americans are believed held by the group that freed <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Glaucoma Patient Complains of Slow Pot Permission</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A glaucoma patient here complains she is going blind waiting for permission to legally use marijuana, and a federal official acknowledged Wednesday that the application procedure is complicated. <PERSON> Elvy </PERSON> <PERSON> Musikka </PERSON> was tried in August on charges of growing marijuana plants in her back yard. She and her physician successfully argued that using the drug was the only way to relieve glaucoma's pressure on her eyes. After her arrest, she applied to the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> for a federal program to receive pot legally for medical treatments. That was six months ago. Tuesday she said she is already blind in the right eye, and slowly losing the remaining sight in her left eye waiting for her application to be processed. <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said by law she can not discuss details of Ms. <PERSON> Musikka </PERSON>'s case. But she noted that even the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> is involved in clearing applications. `` It not only involves this agency, it involves the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION>,'' she said. `` It's not just a simple matter of saying, ` <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>, give us permission.''' Appearing with Ms. <PERSON> Mussika </PERSON> at her news conference was stockbroker <PERSON> Irvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenfeld </PERSON>, who suffers from a rare disease that causes tumors to grow in his bones. Marijuana enhances the medication he takes and helps ease the pain. He is one of only two <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION> residents permitted to use the drug legally. `` I know how many hours it takes to fill out the paperwork,'' said <PERSON> Rosenfeld </PERSON>. `` This is how they put me off for 5 -LCB- years.'' Since her acquittal by <ORGANIZATION> Broward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judge </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Polen </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> Musikka </PERSON> said she has been getting marijuana when she can from friends. It's either that or lose her remaining sight, she said. `` Anyone that's helping me now is breaking the law,'' she said. `` They're human people, compassionate people who care.'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> is president of the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cannabis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Therapeutics </ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based organization that helps people legally get marijuana for medical purposes. `` We are publicly watching a human being go blind because of an unresponsive federal government,'' said <PERSON> Randall </PERSON>, who won the legal right to use marijuana to treat his glaucoma 12 years ago. He said it could take a lawsuit against the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> to force action on Ms. <PERSON> Mussika </PERSON>'s application. Ms. <PERSON> Musikka </PERSON> was born with congenital cataracts and developed glaucoma as she grew up. Glaucoma, the leading cause of blindness in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, increases pressure on the eyeball and optic nerve and causes a progressive loss of sight.

She faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> granted a defense motion Wednesday to reinstate a $ 5,000 bond for <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON> and set sentencing for Nov. 9. <PERSON> Slagle </PERSON> said he felt his half-sister is not guilty of neglect and said she entered into the plea agreement because she was `` threatened'' with the possibility of a 20 - to 50-year prison term on the murder charge

 A comprehensive settlement in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> will be impossible to achieve without an understanding between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the foreign minister of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> said Wednesday. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> said a major defect of the Central American peace plan signed Aug. 7, 1987 is its assumption that the five nations involved could solve their own problems. The minister termed this view as `` simplistic'' and said in an interview the only reason <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> endorsed the plan was to avoid being portrayed as an obstacle to peace. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> made his statements one day after he spoke to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> and urged the creation of an international peace force to evict the U.S.-backed Contra rebels from Honduran territory. Thousands of rebels have settled in the border area since <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> ended military aid to the Contras earlier this year. The foreign minister proposed that military units from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> carry out the evacuation, using force if necessary. His proposal appeared to represent a break with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration policy but the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it was reviewing the plan with an open mind. `` We will give the <LOCATION> Honduran </LOCATION> proposal serious consideration,'' said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said. in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Even if a peacekeeping force is agreed to, such a force only would represent a partial solution, <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> said. `` We can not stop the Soviets from supplying arms to the Sandinistas,'' he said. `` That is an issue that has to be addressed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' If there is `` not a minimum of understanding between them, it is going to be absolutely impossible to reach any kind of settlement in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> declared. He said international organizations such as the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> can not expect <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> by itself to resolve a problem created in part by superpower policies. The Soviet position, reiterated in talks in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last month, is that the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> would cease arms deliveries to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> suspends lethal aid to its allies in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has rejected that proposal. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> said after his talks in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Sept. 23 that the gap between the two countries' positions had not narrowed. Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> is expected to hold additional discussions with Soviet officials on <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> later this month.

 Republican <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and Democrat <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> prepared Wednesday for their prime-time debate, each man eager to aid his presidential ticket and trade in his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat for the vice presidency. Debate sponsors looked for a television audience in the millions, presidential standardbearers <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> among them. For the 67-year-old <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and the 41-year-old <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, the stakes could n't be higher in a presidential campaign that remained too close to call. One poll suggested that the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator's presence on the Republican ticket was working against <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Republicans hoped <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> could reassure voters that he has the maturity and qualifications to serve as vice president. Democrats looked to <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> to attract undecided moderate and conservative Democrats to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' side. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> both spent the day in final preparations, taking a close look at the stage where they would face off for their 90-minute televised encounter. `` We're ready,'' said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. `` You're going to see <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as he really is.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said he was `` feeling great.'' Asked what he would try to accomplish in the debate, he replied simply, `` Win.'' The 10,000-seat <ORGANIZATION> Omaha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auditorium </ORGANIZATION> was condensed into a 2,000-seat theater decorated in red, white and blue for the debate. Just 100 of the seats were available to the public, the rest reserved by the campaigns. The two camps flew dozens of high-profile supporters to <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> to provide immediate post-debate partisan analysis of the encounter, including many <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> colleagues of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, campaigning in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, declared he was `` not worried a bit'' about <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s performance. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spent the day at the <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and said the public would see `` a very strong, thoughtful, mature Senator <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>,'' a slap at <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s youthfulness The vice presidential confrontation was the second of three planned debates in the fall campaign. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> squared off late last month in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and are expected to meet again late next week at a site to be determined, probably <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. With the Republicans owning a slight edge in the polls in the race for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was hoping to use the debate to reassure the voters that his youth is not a liability. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and the Democrats have sought to depict the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator as an inexperienced young man ill-equipped to be a heartbeat away from the presidency. Polls have indicated <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is a drag on the Republican ticket. A <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> poll released earlier in the week suggested that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had a slightly larger lead over <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> when voters were queried only about the top of the ticket. A pair of surveys released Wednesday reiterated those concerns. An <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> survey conducted from Sept. 28 through Tuesday put the race at 51-44, with the Republican ticket in the numerical lead. A Harris poll, conducted last week, gave the Republican ticket a 49-46 lead. However, the ABC-Post survey showed that 40 percent of the people believed <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> to be qualified to become vice president, compared with 67 percent for <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. The Harris survey said a third believed <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> to be qualified to be president if that became necessary, and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> beat <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> 59-37 when voters were asked their preference for vice president. The ABC-Post survey of 1,196 had an error margin of about four points. The Harris survey Sept. 24-29 of 1,235 likely voters had an error margin of three points. While <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s youth and his Vietnam-era service in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> have made him a controversial candidate, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> has had to fend off questions about the numerous differences between his own moderate views and those of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has said he was eager to prove himself to the viewing voters. `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people do n't know me,'' he said Tuesday as he traveled to <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> with a host of top <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> strategists, including media adviser <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Ailes </PERSON>. `` They have a lot of questions ... They do n't have any details of who <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is.'' Both men prepared carefully for the encounter, reading thick briefing books, enduring sessions with their handlers and participating in mock debates. Oregon Republican Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON> played the role of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> in <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s practice sessions. Rep. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckart </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> played the role of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> for <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s workouts. While presidential debates have become more or less a familiar landmark on the campaign trail, televised vice presidential encounters are rare. Only two previous such confrontations have been held, the first one in 1976 between Democrat <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> and GOP <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, and the second one four years ago between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Democrat <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>. As the two vice presidential candidates squared off, the ad wars continued. A new set of 30-second <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ads to be aired nationally starting Wednesday made a more direct attack on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his record on drug enforcement, education, the environment and Social Security. The four ads said the administration dealt secretly with <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, `` the Panamanian drug lord,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` personally'' weakened environmental regulations, `` personally'' cast the tie-breaking vote to cut Social Security'' and `` sat by while college loans for working families were cut.'''

 Israeli soldiers shot and wounded 14 Palestinians in street clashes Wednesday, Arab hospital officials said, and the army reported two soldiers injured when a firebomb hit their jeep in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> police made a house-to-house searches of two Arab neighborhoods for the second day in a row, looking for suspected rioters, police spokesman <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Lapidot </PERSON> said. The sweep, involving 150 policemen, was one of the largest in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> since the Palestinian uprising began last Dec. 8. <PERSON> Nitham </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawelah </PERSON>, 23, of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s Balata refugee camp, died Wednesday after being hit by nine bullets in a clash with troops more than a week ago, officials at <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mukassad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> said. The fatality brought to 281 the number of Palestinians killed in the uprising in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. Six Israelis also have died in the violence. An army spokesman said the two soldiers were hit by a firebomb as they drove through <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television reported that one trooper suffered moderate to serious burns while the other was lightly injured. The army put a curfew on <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION> and started to comb the area. At least 14 people were arrested in <LOCATION> Abu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tor </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Silwan </LOCATION> on the southern outskirts of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, and a police crackdown which started late Tuesday was to continue until Thursday, police and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television said. The detainees `` are suspected of participating in stone-throwing incidents and other disturbances,'' <PERSON> Lapidot </PERSON> said. Among those arrested in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> was <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamde </PERSON>, a preacher at <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aqsa </ORGANIZATION> mosque, one of the holiest shrines of Islam. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio called him a radical religious leader and said he was suspected of distributing underground leaflets. <LOCATION> Silwan </LOCATION> and the Arab sector <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Tor </PERSON> have been major trouble spots since the Palestinian uprising began. Both are part of Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> annexed after the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. <PERSON> Lapidot </PERSON> said police also were searching for tax evaders in the two neighborhoods. Underground leaders of the Palestinian uprising have called on their followers to stop paying taxes to the Israeli authorities. About a dozen Arabs were hustled out of their homes in pajamas and handed court summonses for tax evasion, reporters at the scene said. Troops shot and wounded nine Arabs, including an 11-year-old boy and three teen-agers, in clashes in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, Arab hospital officials said. One of the wounded, 16-year-old <PERSON> Jihad </PERSON> <PERSON> Dib </PERSON>, was shot in the head and listed in critical condition at <LOCATION> Mukassad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. The military command confirmed five casualties and said it was investigating the other reports. In Balata, news of <PERSON> Hawelah </PERSON>'s death sparked a stone-throwing riot and the army clamped a curfew on the camp's 12,000 residents. In the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>'s Beach refugee camp, soldiers wounded five <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON>, three of them teenagers, Arab hospital officials said. They said an 18-year-old was hit in the eye by a plastic bullet. The army said it was checking the reports. Israeli troops detained <PERSON> Naela </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayesh </PERSON>, 28, a Palestinian employee of the U.S.-based Save the Children organization in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, army officials said. They gave no reason for the arrest. In another development, army Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON> defended the use of plastic bullets at a closed-door meeting of the parliamentary <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> and newspapers reported. <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON> was quoted as saying the army was using the bullets to stop riots before they got out of hand and to prevent fatalities. But the figures he presented seemed to contradict his claim. <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON> told the legislators that in the last three weeks, since the massive use of plastic bullets began, 11 Palestinians have been killed and 267 wounded, compared with the previous three weeks in which 10 Arabs were killed and 137 wounded.

 A former <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> employee denied emphatically Wednesday an Iranian opposition leader's assertion that he was involved in negotiating a release of American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. In a statement released by the co-owner of his trade and investment consulting firm here, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawless </PERSON> said: `` I categorically deny and state for the record that I am involved either directly or indirectly in any discussions or negotiations'' on the nine hostages. Former Iranian President <PERSON> Abolhassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bani-Sadr </PERSON> said Tuesday in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> that Lawless had negotiated in behalf of Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with a representative of Iranian Parliament Speaker <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, in an attempt to get American hostages liberated. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> both denied that anyone had been engaged in such negotiations with Iranians or Iranian government figures under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> auspices or that <PERSON> Lawless </PERSON> is a government employee. `` He's not operating under our instruction or direction or anything like that,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said of Lawless. `` What is private status is, I do n't know.'' Lawless was in his office Wednesday, but <PERSON> Therese </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaheen </PERSON>, a co-owner of the business, spoke on his behalf in an interview. She said they felt Lawless' reputation `` had been harmed'' by <PERSON> Bani-Sadr </PERSON>'s allegations made after hostage <PERSON> Mithileshwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, an Indian-born <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> resident, was released from 20 months of captivity by pro-Iranian forces. <PERSON> Lawless </PERSON> said in the statement that `` I have never in my entire life had any direct or indirect contact with any Iranian government officials or any Iranian nationals claiming to represent the Iranian government or any Iranian-related interests.'' <PERSON> Bani-Sadr </PERSON> had said <PERSON> Lawless </PERSON> was attempting to negotiate the release of the hostages on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s behalf. Last week, an Israeli newspaper, The Nation, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government officials were engaged in secret talks with Iranians in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> aimed at setting the hostages free and improving relations between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bani-Sadr </PERSON> also said a shipment of arms furnished by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was destined for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. `` Those charges are not true,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Bani-Sadr </PERSON> is full of beans.'' President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and other administration officials have repeatedly denied that any such direct talks are taking place, or have taken place. Lawless, president of the consulting firm, U.S.-Asia, also said, `` I deny that I have any active relationship with anyone on the staff of Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign organization which relates in any way to this or any similar issue.'' `` I have maintained this position in numerous discussions,'' he said. Lawless worked for the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, between 1973 and 1975, the same years that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s national security adviser, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>, served for the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> at that mission, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>, however, has seen Lawless fewer than a half-dozen times since 1975, and only in social settings, the newspaper quoted its sources as saying. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, which also reported Wednesday that <PERSON> Lawless </PERSON> had served in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> when <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> was there, quoted an unidentified former government official that <PERSON> Lawless </PERSON> had worked in the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>'s operations directorate until several years ago. Spokesmen for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the Republican presidential nominee, have said that Lawless has no relationship with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or with the election campaign. `` We never confirm or deny <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> allegations of employment,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Devine </PERSON>, a spokesman for the intelligence agency. Ms. <PERSON> Shaheen </PERSON> said that `` we showed <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>'s passport, plane tickets and so forth'' in an attempt to dissuade CBS News from reporting his purported activities on behalf of the hostages, but the network broadcast the report earlier this week. `` He could n't possibly have been there'' taking part in any discussions about the hostages, she said of Lawless. `` So <PERSON> Bani-Sadr </PERSON> said he -LRB- Lawless -RRB- knows a couple people in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign. ... It was like, two and two make a thousand. ... We think it is politically inspired by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.'' Lawless is a former <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> employee, who was described as an area analyst beginning in June 1972. He went to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> in 1973, according to a biographic register published by the department. Ms. <PERSON> Shaheen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Lawless </PERSON> also had assignments at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassies in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> before founding the consulting business. `` Primarily our business is in the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>,'' she said, `` 90 percent of it.'' `` The story here is, why are the Iranians fabricating this story,'' she said. `` Because that is the story here because they have nothing to prove'' their allegations. `` It's the biggest hoax since ... whatever,'' she said.

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> expressed strong interest Wednesday in a Honduran proposal for creation of an international peace force to oversee the removal of Nicaraguan rebels from Honduran territory. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Escoto </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in an interview that he requested an urgent meeting with <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> and Honduran Foreign Minister <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> to discuss the proposal. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> recommended in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday night that military forces from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> be sent to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> to carry out the proposed mission. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> said the peace force would be asked to evict Salvadoran rebels from <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, as well as the U.S.-supported Nicaraguan rebels known as Contras. `` We would like to give him the benefit of the doubt,'' <PERSON> D'Escoto </PERSON> said, adding that <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> has made such proposals before but never followed up on them. At least 10,000 Nicaraguan insurgents have settled along the Honduran side of the country's border with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> since the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> suspended military aid to the rebels last February. They depend on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance for their survival. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said the administration will give the <LOCATION> Honduran </LOCATION> proposal `` serious consideration.'' The Contras' use of Honduran territory as a springboard for attacks inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> has produced numerous cross-border clashes between the two countries over the years. <PERSON> D'Escoto </PERSON> said he canceled plans to leave <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Thursday morning so he can pursue the Honduran initiative. He said he is willing to remain until a `` viable and acceptable request'' is made to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> by the secretary-general. He said <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Conteras </PERSON> made a similar proposal to the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> last November but that <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> did not press the matter. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has said for years that military pressure by the Contras is necessary to ensure democracy in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The dismantling of the Contras would almost certainly lead to the consolidation of the leftist Sandinista government and to an escalation of its efforts to undermine its neighbors, the administration has maintained. <PERSON> D'Escoto </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> has long favored establishment of a verification commission to ensure that each Central American country does not interfere with its neighbors. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> said in an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> earlier Wednesday that even if a peace force is agreed to, it would represent only a partial solution. He said one main source of Honduran concern is continued Soviet military aid to the Sandinista government, which <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have estimated at $ 400 million for the first eight months of 1988. `` We can not stop the Soviets from supplying arms to the Sandinistas,'' <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> said. `` That is an issue that has to be addressed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' He said that without a minimum of understanding between the superpowers, `` It is going to be absolutely impossible to reach any kind of settlement in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.''

 The government has tentatively settled a lawsuit charging the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> used nine Canadians as human guinea pigs in mind-control research that included heavy doses of LSD, lawyers in the case said Wednesday. The tentative out-of-court settlement, negotiated by attorneys for the Canadians and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, was announced on the eve of trial at a hearing before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON>, who has presided over the case for eight years. Neither side would discuss the amount of the proposed settlement, which is still subject to final approval by top-level <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials. But sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agreed to pay the plaintiffs a total of $ 750,000. The proposed settlement amounts to `` a statement that every part of our government is under the law, that no part of our government is above the law,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, the plaintiffs' lead attorney. `` This is a case of principle and that principle has been won here,'' he added. The $ 9 million lawsuit claimed that CIA-financed research into mind-control left permanent psychological or emotional damage on the nine patients who underwent treatment in the late 1950s at the <ORGANIZATION> Allan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McGill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>. The research conducted by the institute's director, the late Dr. <PERSON> Ewen </PERSON> <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON>, included week-long sleep induced by drugs, doses of LSD and unusually intense electroshock therapy. Only two of the plaintiffs were given LSD during the period the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> financed <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON>'s research. But <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> gave the drug to several others during other visits to the institute. All the patients underwent treatment that <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> psychiatrist <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifton </PERSON> described in a deposition as deviating from `` the standard and customary psychiatric therapies'' of the period. The treatments also included sensory deprivation and what <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> called `` psychic driving'' _ the repeated playing of recorded messages into a patient's ear for 16 hours. Other experts deposed by lawyers in the case questioned the effectiveness and safety of the treatments, but the government has contended that <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON>'s work was well within the accepted bounds of professional conduct. The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> began researching the effects of LSD and other mind-altering substances in 1953 under Project MK-ULTRA to counter brainwashing techniques believed to have been developed in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. LSD was not then a well-known drug in the West and <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> officials feared that <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> bloc nations would use it to alter the behavior of American diplomats. The 1953 suicide of Dr. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>, who was among a group of <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> scientists who were given after-dinner liquors laced with LSD, prompted the agency to conduct further research with unwitting subjects under stricter medical controls. Two years later, the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> founded the Society for the <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ecology </ORGANIZATION> as a front to finance medical research on unsuspecting subjects. <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> received nearly $ 60,000 from the organization between 1957 and 1960. <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> psychiatrist <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> said his 82-year-old father, `` still remains a shadow of the man he was'' when he sought treatment for anxiety at <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON>'s clinic. Once a `` very, dynamic, successful'' <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> businessman, <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> came home from the hospital as `` somebody who does n't know who he is, or what he is or where he is,'' the son said in a telephone interview `` The man who came out of the hospital was a stranger,'' Dr. <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> said. The elder <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> gradually improved but not until after he sold his dress manufacturing business, said the psychiatrist, whose book `` Father, Son and <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>'' was recently published in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. The government contended in court papers that <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> did not know he was receiving <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> money, though the plaintiffs argue that he was aware of <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> interest and sought the research grants. An internal <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> investigation of Project MK-ULTRA in 1957 concluded that some of the research activities `` are considered to be professionally unethical and in some instances border on the illegal.'' But the plaintiffs contend that the officials who supervised the project were allowed to continue their work unsupervised and unreprimanded despite this finding. The lawsuit was originally filed by nine plaintiffs, but earlier this year <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> dismissed the claim of Dr. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrow </PERSON> because she had filed her claim too late. But <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said <PERSON> Morrow </PERSON> would receive a share of the settlement with the remaining plaintiffs. <PERSON> Morrow </PERSON> was placed in the treatment program after she had applied to <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> for a research fellowship at the institute.

<HEAD>More Looters Reported Killed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Military street patrols killed seven more looters in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mandalay </LOCATION>, bringing the number of people slain since the Sept. 18 military coup to about 440, the state radio reported Wednesday. <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> radio said the shootings occurred Tuesday. It and other official media have described most of those killed since the coup as looters or other `` destructive elements.'' Soldiers are imposing strict rules against public gatherings and looting. Vendors, gamblers and others who once crowded the sidewalks of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> have disappeared. Civil servants and factory workers reported to their jobs for the third day but many left by early afternoon, apparently because of a lack of work in ministries and state enterprises crippled by a long general strike. All government employees were ordered back to work Monday under threat of dismissal. Two new youth organizations, the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> All </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizations </ORGANIZATION>, registered as political parties Wednesday with a commission that is to supervise elections. The political leanings of the two groups were not immediately known. Three main opposition political parties have registered _ the <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> _ but have not said whether they will participate in the elections <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s most powerful party, widely believed to be backed by the new government, has not registered because of its `` complicated position,'' party sources said Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, under another name, was the only legal party for 26 years of repressive military rule and operated with government funds. It has been ordered to divest itself of government assets like all other parties. Party sources said this would prove difficult because the organization, formerly called the <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, had substantial holdings in real estate and other fixed assets acquired all or in part from government funding. Under a Sept. 27 decree, political parties that use state funds, vehicles and other property can not apply for registration. Financing for the <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> included $ 10 million to $ 13.3 million annually in government funds. Western diplomats say Gen. <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> and his new government back the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> but are observing legal requirements in an attempt to quiet anti-government feelings.

 Police torpedoed a planned second day of sit-ins and arrests at abortion clinics Wednesday by impounding a bus and increasing security at clinics where 343 were arrested a day earlier. Fourteen protesters were arrested, and at least three were dragged to police vans. Most demonstrators, however, limited activities to praying and singing hymns. City Solicitor <PERSON> Raines </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said the 14 arrested Wednesday were charged with giving a false name, unlawful assembly and refusing to obey a police officer. Some of the protesters arrested Tuesday began posting bond Wednesday after identifying themselves. Protest organizers have encouraged those arrested to call themselves only `` Baby <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON>'' or `` Baby <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON>'' and remain in jail. The bus was impounded as it took demonstrators from a silent vigil at one clinic to a demonstration at another. `` The officer determined -LRB- the bus -RRB- to be unsafe for operation. When it was stopped there was smoke coming out and it was crowded with too many people,'' said police spokeswoman <PERSON> Myrna </PERSON> <PERSON> May </PERSON>. She said she did not know how many were aboard. Protesters on Tuesday complained that police treated them with unnecessary harshness, twisting arms and fingers and using pressure-point holds just under the ears to force them into buses. Some screamed or cried as they were taken away, and four were treated for apparently minor injuries. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Napper </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> commissioner of public safety, said he believed there were isolated arrests `` in which police could have acted more gently'' but that he thought the overall reaction was justified. Demonstrators on Wednesday arrived gradually at the Feminist Women's <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION>, where police arrested one for trying to jump a barricade and two others for assaulting a woman trying to enter the clinic, Maj. <PERSON> W.W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Holley </PERSON> said. About 50 police, including several on horses, were posted at the small clinic. On Tuesday night about 75 people at an anti-abortion rally stayed behind for tactical training and said they would take part in Wednesday's action and face arrest, but fewer than that were in evidence at the clinic. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON>, a leader of Operation Rescue, which is organizing a week of attempts to close <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> abortion clinics, said demonstrators would try to cross police lines `` only if we see a woman preparing to go in and kill her child.'' He claimed the police lines kept women out. `` So there is no need for us to risk arrest,'' he said. <PERSON> Lynne </PERSON> <PERSON> Randall </PERSON>, the clinic director, denied that the demonstration is stopping abortions and said the protesters were `` acting like thugs.'' She said several patients had arrived at the clinic. `` They might postpone it,'' she said. `` Our appointment numbers are the same, they are just distributed differently.'' She said the clinic usually sees 10 to 50 patients a day. Around midday at least two women were ushered into the clinic. <PERSON> Foreman </PERSON> contended both were actually employees trying to give the impression that the clinic was operating. Police announced last week that they would use rougher tactics on demonstrators this week than they did during the Democratic National Convention in July, when Operation Rescue first organized protests in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. During those demonstrations and several that followed during the summer, more than 750 people were arrested. Hundreds refused to identify themselves, making it impossible to free them on bond and causing crowded jails. Many of the 360 jailed Tuesday used similar tactics. <PERSON> Napper </PERSON> said Wednesday's rougher arrests and an injunction limiting demonstrators' activities were partly responsible for Wednesday's low turnout. He said the department has had to pull officers from other assignments and close the police academy and put recruits on the job to protect the clinics.

<HEAD>IRA Bomb Fails To Detonate Under Prison Warden's Car</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A prison warden and his wife escaped an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> assassination attempt Wednesday because a bomb planted in the undercarriage of their car failed to explode. The attempt on <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Murtagh </PERSON>'s life was made a day after <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Armour </PERSON>, 48, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Officers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, was killed by an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> bomb that blew up his car as he drove through Protestant east <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. In a statement released to local media, the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> said a 2-pound bomb did not explode as planned while <PERSON> Murtagh </PERSON>, 46, and his wife drove away from their home in <LOCATION> Lisburn </LOCATION>, 7 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. It said when the Murtaghs parked the car in a shopping center lot, attempts to detonate the explosive were abandoned `` to avoid any danger to civilians.'' `` Today, <PERSON> Murtagh </PERSON> was lucky,'' the statement said. `` He and his cohorts will not always be so lucky.'' The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> accused <PERSON> Murtagh </PERSON> of `` repressive measures'' against Irish nationalist prisoners and said he was responsible for the strip-searching of female inmates when he ran Armagh prison in the early 1980s. Police would not confirm that <PERSON> Murtagh </PERSON>, now warden of the Hydepark center for young offenders in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, was the target of Wednesday's bomb. A spokesman said only that the late-model <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> belonged to the wife of a prison officer. <PERSON> Murtagh </PERSON> and his wife were in a shopping center department store at midday when a telephone caller told a radio station about the bomb, the police spokesman said. A British army bomb squad destroyed the device in a controlled explosion about 2 -LCB- hours later, he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` The terrorists must have been aware when they planted the device that the vehicle could have been used by any member of the family,'' the police spokesman said. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to drive the British from <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and unite the predominately <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> province with the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, which is predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>. Its statement claimed guerrillas got through tight security around <PERSON> Murtagh </PERSON>'s home to plant the bomb. The house is about 150 yards from a British army barracks. According to the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>, the bombs planted Tuesday and Wednesday contained an explosive made in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> called Semtex. Police believe the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> obtained the lightweight, odorless explosive through <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. The explosive has featured prominently in attacks this year on security forces and commercial targets.

<HEAD>3-year-old Boy Cleared in Shooting Death of Father</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A 3-year-old boy who shot and killed his father as the man beat the child's mother said afterward he would have done it again. `` I killed him,'' the boy reportedly said afterward. `` Now he's dead If he would have hit my mother, I would have shot him again.'' Prosecutors said Tuesday they wo n't take any legal measures against the child, who was n't identified, because he could n't have acted intentionally. `` We feel that this is an act that a 3-year-old can not contemplate,'' <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Schigur </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prosecutor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> juvenile division said Tuesday `` I mean, he ca n't form any kind of intent. ... `` There just does n't seem to be any reason to pursue it.'' The boy's mother, who spoke Tuesday on condition neither she nor her son be identified, said, `` It was an accident; it just happened.'' The boy, now 4, shot and killed <PERSON> Sherwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON>, 47, on June 18. The decision on what to do about the case was delayed pending the results of toxicology tests, said assistant prosecutor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolock </PERSON>. The tests showed <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON> had a blood alcohol level of 0.08 percent at the time of the shooting, just above <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s legal level of impairment. <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> homicide detectives at first refused to believe the youngster could have fired the gun. But they said gunpowder residue tests showed the child was the only one in the room who did fire a gun. The city's top homicide investigator, Inspector <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, said it would be unusual for a toddler to have the strength to pull a trigger. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said detectives gave the boy the weapon unloaded, asking him to show how he used it. `` We checked to see if that was possible,'' <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said. `` It was.'' According to the police report, <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON> and his 25-year-old girlfriend, the boy's mother, were having a barbecue at their home when the woman changed a musical tape <ORGANIZATION> Cannon </ORGANIZATION> had been playing. <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON> became angry, saying she was making a fool out of him, the report said. He began grabbing and pushing the woman and went and got a .25 - caliber automatic he kept hidden from the The 3-year-old was among at least four children in the house who were watching the late-night fight, the report said. Cannon walked into the room with the gun, but set it on a table, saying he did n't need it. He then grabbed his girlfriend, threw her to the floor and held her down as she yelled he was hurting her. A shot was fired and <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON> asked, `` Who got shot?'' Then, he said, `` It's me.'' Cannon fell over, mortally wounded in the back. Two other adults and three of the children in the room told police the boy had picked up the gun, aimed it at his father and fired. The boy's mother said Tuesday he had cried a little after the shooting and then fell asleep for a while. That night at police headquarters, the boy smiled and posed for a <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> photo that homicide detectives often take of suspects. A detective let the boy keep one. His mother said she considered counseling for her son, especially after his pre-school teacher said he had been having crying spells, but she did n't get around to it because the family moved after the shooting.

<TEXT>
 Nearly 1,000 Kurdish refugees returned to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> on Wednesday as the deadline neared for a government amnesty, two months after they fled to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> claiming <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> dropped chemical bombs on their settlements. The 966 Kurds were taken by bus and truck from a tent city in <LOCATION> Yuksekova </LOCATION> to a border post in <LOCATION> Habur </LOCATION> and then across a bridge over the <LOCATION> Tigris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. They were among 60,000 Kurds who flocked to five tent cities in southeastern <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> last August during an army offensive against Kurdish rebels in the mountains of northeastern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Regional Gov. <PERSON> Hayri </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozakcioglu </PERSON> told a news conference another group of Kurdish refugees, numbering 1,500, was due to be transferred to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> Thursday. He said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> assured the Turkish government the refugees will be safely settled back in the villages. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> on Sept. 6 proclaimed a `` general and comprehensive'' amnesty for the Kurds at the urging of <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has said that thousands accepted the amnesty, but only a few were confirmed to have returned. The deadline for the amnesty is Thursday evening. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Inal </PERSON> <PERSON> Batu </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> is trying to persuade <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to extend the amnesty period. <PERSON> Batu </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Ankara </LOCATION> the Kurdish refugees signed papers saying they were returning home voluntarily under terms of the amnesty. Returning refugees said that when they left their villages, the danger was very real. `` When the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> planes came to our villages dropping chemical bombs, we had no other chance but to escape,'' said <PERSON> Eyup </PERSON> <PERSON> Seydu </PERSON>, a 38-year-old refugee. `` But I decided to go back after the amnesty. I am not afraid, I have done nothing wrong.'' <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has denied it used chemical weapons against the Kurds, though it has acknowledged using such weapons in its 8-year-old war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Suleyman </PERSON> <PERSON> Fettah </PERSON>, 61, who was returning to his village of <LOCATION> Rekani </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> with his 14-member family, said he never wanted to leave his village and that Kurdish guerrillas `` forced us to flee.'' The Wednesday group included 501 children and 245 women. The refugees, carrying a few belongings such as blankets or mattresses, looked exhausted after the 20-hour trip to the border aboard 16 buses and four trucks. <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> initially asked the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> to supervise the Kurds' return, but the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> declined after <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> refused to grant its request for further guarantees on behalf of the refugees. The Kurds, 20 million people living in a region where the borders of <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> converge, have been fighting for independence for the past century. The latest rebellion, led by <PERSON> Massoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Barzani </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Kurdish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, in alliance with <PERSON> Jamal </PERSON> <PERSON> Talabani </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kurdistan </ORGANIZATION>, tried to take advantage of the Iran-Iraq war But after an Aug. 20 cease-fire in the war, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> sent seasoned troops against the Kurds.

<HEAD>`Choctaw Kid' Who Survived 1946 Alcatraz Breakout Attempt Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnes </PERSON>, a career criminal who gained notoriety for a failed escape attempt from <LOCATION> Alcatraz </LOCATION> in 1946 that resulted in seven deaths, has died in prison here. He was 61. Officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisoners </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that a preliminary autopsy revealed complications relating to kidney problems that could have led to <PERSON> Carnes </PERSON>' death Monday. At age 18, <PERSON> Carnes </PERSON>, who had the nickname `` Choctaw Kid,'' became the youngest prisoner ever incarcerated at <LOCATION> Alcatraz </LOCATION>, the now-closed federal prison on an island in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, in 1945. The next year he was drawn into a daring escape plot that quickly went awry. Two guards were killed and several were wounded. The six inmates who participated got control of little more than one cell house.

 A man was in custody Wednesday charged with abducting and raping two mentally disabled boys whom he took on a five-day trip around central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, tying them to beds to keep them from escaping. The desperate families had been distributing fliers and even consulting a psychic in their efforts to find the boys, ages 13 and 14. `` I was so relieved,'' said the mother of the 13-year-old Port St. Lucie boy. `` So much time had elapsed.

The boys disappeared Sept. 29 after they decided not to ride the school bus home from their school for mentally disabled children. <PERSON> Halpin </PERSON> allegedly picked them up with promises of a motorcycle and a stereo.

 A police recruit who needed a liver transplant after collapsing during rigorous training was showing signs of emerging from a coma, his family said Wednesday. <LOCATION> Pittsfield </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Everest </PERSON> <PERSON> Wojtkowski </PERSON> said the family of <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> told her the 25-year-old <LOCATION> Pittsfield </LOCATION> police cadet had been able to recognize his mother and pregnant wife and respond to questions by shaking his head. Asked whether he was out of the coma, sister-in-law <PERSON> Becky </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>: `` It's hard to say, it's a slow process coming out of a coma,'' She added, `` there are signs that he's coming out though.'' Spokesmen at the <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> hospital where <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> is being treated would only say that <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> remains in critical condition after undergoing a liver transplant last week. The mayor said doctors have been able to remove <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> from a respirator for brief periods. A total of 16 cadets were hospitalized for dehydration and exhaustion after <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> collapsed on the first day of training, Sept. 19. The Agawam academy was closed on the third day of training and classes were moved until the drinking water could be checked. It was found untainted, and all the cadets except <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> have since been released from hospitals. State Police Lt. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shea </PERSON>, one of two state troopers who took over the class this week after the original state police instructors requested reassignment during the investigations, described the morale of the cadets as `` pretty good under the circumstances.'' But he said the classes were constantly being interrupted by investigators from the attorney general's office. A task force assembled by Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also is preparing to launch an inquiry into training at regional police academies, as is a special 11-member state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON>, a former district attorney and past president of the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> chosen to head the governor's board, said his group of legislators, police officials and doctors would first meet Thursday <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON> said he expected the focus of the inquiry would be the physical and psychological training given recruits at the <LOCATION> Agawam </LOCATION> academy and the state's six other regional police academies. State health officials and others have blamed extended exercise without adequate water for the hospitalization of nearly one-third of the recruits in the class.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> cleared the way Wednesday for democratic elections to be held in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> on Nov. 16. <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s opposition <ORGANIZATION> Pakistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is widely expected to win at least a simple majority in any freely held elections. The court removed the last hurdle in the way of scheduled elections this November by blocking a move to reconvene the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> dissolved by the late President <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON>. In a unanimous decision, it upheld a lower court ruling last week that <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s move in May was unconstitutional, but also found no grounds to restore to power the old <ORGANIZATION> Muslim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Junejo </PERSON>. The high court said in a statement that while its findings might imply that the <PERSON> Junejo </PERSON> government stands revived, `` We are not unmindful of the fact that the whole nation is geared up for elections and we do not propose to do anything which makes confusion ... which would be the result if the vital process of election is interrupted at this juncture.'' <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Naqshbandi </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Muslim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Junejo </PERSON> and other party leaders would abide by the decision and would drop their demands to reinstate the former <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> and reconvene the legislature. `` Our position has been vindicated that <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s decision to dissolve the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> was unconstitutional, illegal and uncalled for,'' he said. It was the second time this week that the high court ruled against the late military strongman. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> and several of his top generals were killed in a plane crash on Aug. 17. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled Sunday in favor of a petition by Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> challenging <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s July decree that the elections in November be on a non-party basis. The court said the constitution guaranteed that candidates could run on party tickets, rather than as individuals under <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s plan. The last democratic elections, held in 1973, swept Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Zulfikar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, into power as <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s first popularly elected prime minister <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> was deposed by <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> in a military coup in 1977. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> had him hanged two years later. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> ruled under martial law until 1985, when he allowed elections on a non-party basis. The opposition boycotted the voting and candidates favoring the pro-Zia <ORGANIZATION> Muslim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> swept the elections. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> shared power with the <PERSON> Junejo </PERSON> government for three years, then stunned the nation by abruptly firing the prime minister and his <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> on May 29 and dissolving the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> accused them of corruption, incompetence and of failing to implement his program of Islamization. <PERSON> Junejo </PERSON> denied the charges and called <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s move illegal and `` arbitrary.'' <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> scheduled elections for mid-November on a non-party basis. After his death, <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Ghulam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> assumed the presidency and pledged that the elections would proceed on schedule. He left it to the courts to decide whether the polls should be open to political parties. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has announced that voting for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> will be held Nov. 16 and for provincial assemblies three days later. The commission estimates that about 46 million of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s 107 million people are eligible to vote.

 Federal officials acted Wednesday to reduce peak air traffic at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in reaction to a report that mistakes by controllers there this year are already more than double the number in 1987. Controllers at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> made two errors Friday, another Sunday and another Tuesday, bringing the number of recorded mistakes at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> this year to 30, said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Zochert </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. In all four cases, planes were allowed to get too close to each other, officials said. No one was injured. <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hartsfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> has had six errors this year, and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s National Airport two, officials said. In 1987, there were 12 errors by air traffic controllers at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION>, which has been the subject of an investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Zochert </PERSON> said. The airport is one the world's busiest. `` I ca n't explain the reason -LRB- for the errors -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Zochert </PERSON> said. `` That's the question everybody wants the answer to and if there was an easy solution we'd have it.'' Late Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> called a news conference to say flights to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> would sit on the ground in the cities where they originate when there is too much traffic over <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION>, spokeswoman <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Dettmer </PERSON> said. During peak periods _ usually between 4:45 p.m. and 9:15 p.m. _ the maximum number of planes allowed to depart and land would be reduced to about 155 per hour from 180, Ms. <PERSON> Dettmer </PERSON> said. The latest incidents came just two months after the safety board issued a report saying that chronic understaffing, mandatory overtime, outdated equipment and inadequate training had contributed to mistakes at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION>. Despite the rise in mistakes, <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> remains a safe airport, <PERSON> Zochert </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said the board met with <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials Wednesday to discuss the `` new rash of operational errors. We got a positive feeling the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> will be taking steps.'' In Tuesday's incident, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet and a smaller <ORGANIZATION> Simmons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> plane came within 500 feet of each other while approaching O'Hare, he said. On Sunday, two <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> jets came within 500 feet of each other after the pilot of one plane apparently followed an order intended for the other. On Friday, two <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> jets came near each other when a controller apparently mistakenly gave one of them an order to descend, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said. In a second incident Friday, an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet and a <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> jet came within 400 feet vertically and a mile horizontally when the pilot of the American jet apparently failed to repeat an order to reduce speed and the controller did not seek confirmation, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> requires airplanes in the area to be separated a minimum of three miles horizontally and 1,000 feet vertically. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellino </PERSON>, regional representative of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Controllers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION>'s radar room on Friday was `` a zoo.'' With Friday's 3,842 takeoffs and landings _ just below the all-time record of 3,853 set the day before _ there should have been 18 journeyman controllers and several `` developmental'' controllers on duty. Developmental controllers have fewer responsibilities than the journeymen. But <PERSON> Bellino </PERSON> said there were only 14 controllers working and the problem was made worse when the controllers who made the errors were temporarily relieved of their duties, giving those who remained even more responsibilities. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> could not immediately say how many controllers were on duty Friday, but <PERSON> Zochert </PERSON> said the number of controllers working at the airport has risen from 87 last year to 94 as of Sept. 1.

<HEAD>New Chief Ideologist Charts Middle Course In Speech</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The new Soviet chief ideologist appeared to chart a middle course in the first major speech since he was elected to the ruling Soviet Politburo, voicing support for reform as well as for strong central authority. <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>'s speech to an international conference on contemporary socialism was made Tuesday and reprinted Wednesday by the government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>. The speech appeared to show some slight differences from the beliefs of President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>, a political economist, was named a member of the Politburo on Friday by the policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. He also was named to head a party commission on ideology, indicating he also assumed the ideology portfolio once held by <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON> is widely believed to favor a more conservative approach to social problems than <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>'s speech appeared to stake out a middle ground, balancing the need for reform with maintenance of political authority. `` We proceed from the fact that the socialist economy is impossible without the strong role of the center,'' <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>, 59, told the conference. He also seemed to say the criticism allowed by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s drive for greater openness, or `` glasnost,'' had gone too far. `` Unfortunately, there have been some irresponsible attempts to cast a shadow over <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>'s inheritance, over the basic values of socialism,'' <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> said. `` And how else can those statements appearing in the press be interpreted that claim that the command-administrative system resulted from <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>, those attempts to deny the socialist nature of our system, that even doubt the rightness of our choice for socialism?'' <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> did, however, say socialism now faces the need for `` deep qualitative rejuvenation.'' In his 3 -LCB- years since becoming <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has often mentioned the common interests of the West and the socialist camp. <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>, however, said it was `` outdated'' to maintain capitalism and socialism were developing on a parallel course. `` Certainly, there could not be any merging, any convergence of the two systems,'' the new Politburo member said. `` Each will develop in accordance with its own rules.''

 Twenty people, including journalists, police and students, were wounded by rocks and buckshot Wednesday during protests at <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s largest university, school officials and witnesses said. Meanwhile in the Andes highland city of <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION>, police said leftist guerrillas slit the throats of two men and shot a woman to death for their alleged collaboration with government forces. University of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marcos </LOCATION> officials, students and reporters at the disturbance said the injuries occurred as dozens of riot police fired tear gas and buckshot to disperse 300 campus protesters. The protesters in turn threw rocks at police. At least 60 demonstrators were taken away by police in paddy wagons. Police refused to discuss the confrontation. A Peruvian photographer for the British news agency <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION> and a cameraman for Viznews, a television news service, received minor injuries when they were hit with buckshot fired by police, <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION> said. An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> photographer said he saw several police and students wounded in a `` hail of rocks and buckshot'' during the second straight day of campus disturbances at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marcos </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s largest university with about 45,000 students The university is four miles west of downtown. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marcos </LOCATION> Rector <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Campos </PERSON> said protests increased after the school announced last week that it might have to close due to a lack of operating funds. <PERSON> Campos </PERSON> said the government, which recently imposed austerity measures to combat severe economic woes, has not responded to the school's request for $ 5.2 million in funding. A column of Shining Path rebels late Monday raided <PERSON> Muyurina </PERSON>, a farming village outside <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION>, and executed the three during a kangaroo trial in the central plaza. Police said villagers were forced to witness the slayings. The Shining Path, a Maoist guerrilla group that has waged an insurgency for eight years, has executed hundreds of highland peasants amid similar mock trials to punish suspected government collaborators and scare other peasants from acting against the rebellion, officials say. The impoverished farmland surrounding <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION>, 225 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, was the birthplace and remains the stronghold of the Shining Path. The fighting has spread throughout the central Andes, down to the populated coast and into the eastern jungle, claiming at least 12,000 lives.

 Leftist guerrillas firing antitank rockets and submachine guns attacked three northeastern towns Wednesday and captured 18 policemen, a police colonel and a mayor's office said Three people died and 15 were wounded during the attacks on the towns of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wilches </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pablo </LOCATION> and Cantagallo. The attacks came as <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s largest labor union, the Unified Workers' Central, launched a series of marches to protest low wages, inflation and right wing death squads that have killed more than 100 labor leaders in the last two years. The army said in a communique that it raided suspected guerrilla hideouts in five cities and foiled guerrilla plans to set off bombs in the cities. The statement gave no further details about the reported raids in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, the capital, and in the cities of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cali </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bucarmanaga </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Neiva </LOCATION>. Armored personnel carriers and army jeeps mounted with machine guns patroled streets in the five cities Wednesday. A total of about 300 guerrillas belonging to the <ORGANIZATION> Colombian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> attacked the three towns, police Col. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Montenegro </PERSON> said in a broadcast interview with the <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> radio station <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION>. The strongest attack came in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wilches </LOCATION>, where guerrillas destroyed the police station with shoulder-fired rockets, said <LOCATION> Montenegro </LOCATION>, who heads the national police force in the northeast state of <LOCATION> Santander </LOCATION>. Two policemen were wounded and a woman caught in the crossfire died of a heart attack, the colonel said. Two civilians were wounded, he said.

 <PERSON> Leander </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the former district attorney who lost his father's legacy of power in <LOCATION> Plaquemines </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parish </LOCATION> in fights with his brother, died Wednesday of a heart attack. He was 68 years old. `` He was brought into the <LOCATION> Meadowcrest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> emergency room by ambulance in critical condition and he died at the hospital,'' said hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, who lived in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, apparently suffered the heart attack during a business meeting at <LOCATION> Idlewild </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plantation </LOCATION>, the family estate in <LOCATION> Belle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chasse </LOCATION>, said A.R. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a close friend of <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> was a son of the fervent segregationist who built one of the most dominant political machines in Southern history _ ruling <LOCATION> Plaquemines </LOCATION> for more than four decades, first as district attorney and later as <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> president. Before he died in 1969, Judge <PERSON> Leander </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> _ so known because he had briefly held an appointed federal judgeship at the start of his political career _ saw <PERSON> Leander </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> anointed as district attorney and his other son, <PERSON> Chalin </PERSON>, as council president. <PERSON> Leander </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who first became district attorney in 1960, did not run in 1984. He never announced his decision or said why he made it. He reportedly had been hospitalized that year for circulation problems. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> also had serious political troubles since he and <PERSON> Chalin </PERSON> had begun feuding in the late 1970s, and in 1979 <PERSON> Leander </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> began investigating the parish council. A grand jury indicted <PERSON> Chalin </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> in 1981 on charges of misuse and abuse of parish property and finances. The panel was dismissed later that year, just as it was about to indict the district attorney and the family-owned <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on charges of stealing millions of dollars in mineral royalties from parish-owned lands. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> and former state District Judge <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> were indicted on malfeasance charges because of that dismissal, but were acquitted in February 1986. <PERSON> Chalin </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> was ousted as parish president in 1983, the same year that a lawyer unearthed an old legal document revealing that Judge <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> had secretly acquired control of parish lands in the 1930s. The parish sued the <ORGANIZATION> Perezes </ORGANIZATION>, but two courts ruled that the parish had filed its lawsuit 33 years too late. Those courts eventually were overruled by the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, and the parish dropped $ 80 million in claims against the family in September 1987 for about $ 12 million and control of the oil-rich lands, on which it expects to earn $ 3 million a year. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> is survived by his wife, <PERSON> Aphra </PERSON>, whom he married after the death of his first wife, <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON>; four children, and their children.

 Two gunmen held at least eight customers hostage for an hour at a bank in this <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> coast town Wednesday but released them when police entered the building, a state police official said. No one was injured and the two would-be robbers were arrested, said <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Velazco </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON>, a state police commander. `` They did n't have time to get the loot,'' <PERSON> Velazco </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> said. He said the men, armed with pistols, entered the <ORGANIZATION> Banoro </ORGANIZATION> bank shortly after 9 a.m. -LRB- noon EDT -RRB- and held from eight to 10 of the customers, `` whoever they wanted,'' next to the vault. An undetermined number of other people also were in the bank, he said. About 50 state, city and federal police and highway patrolmen surrounded the block where the bank is located, he said. Then 20 to 25 of them entered through different doors, using a megaphone to urge the assailants not to shoot, he said. `` They obeyed,'' <PERSON> Velazco </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> said. He identified those arrested as <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, 22, and <PERSON> Paulino </PERSON> <PERSON> Paredes </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON>, 23, both of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mochis </LOCATION>. In April, six heavily armed men took more than 42 hostages in a 24-hour siege in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mochis </LOCATION> at a branch of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION>. Five people were killed and 15 wounded. Unconfirmed reports said those robbers took about $ 13,000 from the bank, but officials would not confirm the amount. After releasing the hostages, the gunmen were allowed to leave in an armored car but were later arrested.

 Here is the text of Wednesday night's debate between vice presidential candidates Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, and Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, R-Ind. Moderator: Good evening. On behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Presidential Debates I am pleased to welcome you to this vice presidential debate. I'm <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodruff </PERSON> of PBS's <ORGANIZATION> MacNeil </ORGANIZATION> @ Lehrer News Hour and Frontline. My colleagues on the panel are <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Margolis </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Brit </PERSON> <PERSON> Hume </PERSON> of ABC News. The importance of tonight's debate is underscored by two facts: both <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said their selection of a running mate would reveal a lot about themselves; and, based on the history since World War II, there is almost a 50-50 chance that one of the two men here tonight will become president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The candidates are Senator <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nominee, and Senator <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, the Democratic nominee. For the next 90 minutes we will be questioning the candidates following a format designed and agreed to by representatives of the two campaigns. However, there are no restrictions on the questions that my colleagues and I may ask this evening. By prior agreement between the two candidates, the first question goes to Senator <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, and you have two minutes to respond. Senator, you have been criticized, as we all know, for your decision to stay out of the Vietnam War, for your poor academic record. But more troubling to some are some of the comments that have been made by people in your own party. Just last week, former Secretary of State <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> said that your pick was the dumbest call <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> could have made. Your leader in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, your leader in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, said that a better qualified person could have been chosen. Other Republicans have been far more critical in private. Why do you think that you have not made a more substantial impression on some of these people who have been able to observe you up close? Quayle: The question goes to whether I am qualified to be vice president and, in the case of a tragedy, whether I'm qualified to be president. Qualifications for the office of vice president or president are not age alone. We must look at accomplishments, and we must look at experience. I have more experience than others that have sought the office of vice president. Now let's look at qualifications, and let's look at the three biggest issues that are going to be confronting <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in the next presidency. Those three issues are national security and arms control, jobs and education, and the federal budget deficit. On each one of those issues I have more experience than does the governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. In national security and arms control you have to understand the relationship between a ballistic missile, a warhead, what throw-weight, what mega-tonnage is; you better understand about telemetry and encryption; and you better understand that you have to negotiate from a position of strength. These are important issues because we want to have more arms control and arms reductions. In the area of jobs and education, I wrote the Job Training Partnership Act, a bi-partisan bill -- a bill that has trained and employed over three million economically disadvantaged youth and adults in this country. On the area of federal budget deficit, I have worked eight years on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and I wish that the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would give us the line-item veto, to help deal with that. And if qualifications alone are going to be the issue in this campaign, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has more qualifications than <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> combined. Moderator: Senator <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, Senator <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. I'm going to interrupt at this point and ask once again that the audience please keep your responses as quiet as possible. We know that many of you here are for one candidate or another, but you are simply taking time away from your candidate, and more likely than not, you'll be causing the partisans for the other candidate to react again on _ when their candidate speaks _ so please. Senator <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, you have one minute to respond. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>: This debate tonight, is not about the qualifications for the vice presidency. The debate is whether or not <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> are qualified to be president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Because <PERSON> Judy </PERSON>, just as you have said, that has happened too often in the past. And if that tragedy should occur, we have to step in there without any margin for error, without time for preparation, to take over the responsibility for the biggest job in the world _ that of running this great country of ours. To take over the awesome responsibility for commanding the nuclear weaponry that this country has. No, the debate tonight, is a debate about the presidency itself, and a presidential decision that has to be made by you. The stakes could not be higher.

 Q: Senator <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> -- a question for you, and you also have two minutes to respond. What -- while this -- is not so much your qualifications, but your split on policy with Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. He has said that he does not want a clone of himself, but you disagree with him on some major issues -- aid to the Nicaraguan Contras, the death penalty, gun control, among others. If you had to step in to the presidency, who's agenda would you pursue? Yours, or his? <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>: Well, I'm delighted to respond to that question, because we agree on so many things, and the vast majority of the issues. We agree on the fact that we have to cut this deficit, and Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been able to cut that deficit ten budgets in a row in the State of Massachussetts, while he lowered the tax burden on their people from one of the highest to one of the lower in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. That is a major sense of achievement, and I admire that. And I'm just delighted to be on the ticket with him. Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and I agree that we ought to have a trade policy for this country, that we've seen this administration more than double the national debt, that they've moved this country from the number one lender nation in the world to the number one debtor nation in the world under their administration, that they have not had a trade policy, that they've let trade be a handmaiden for the foreign policy objectives of the country, that this country has exported too many jobs and not enough products. And as I worked to pass a trade bill through the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, they threw roadblocks in the way every step of the way, but we passed a trade bill that has this premise: that any country that has full access to our markets, we're entitled to full access to their markets. Now, that means that we're going to stand tough for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and we're going to protect those jobs, and we're going to push <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> products, and we're going to open up markets around the world. We'll show leadership in that respect and turn this deficit in trade around. That's the sort of thing that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and I will do to bring about a better <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> for all of our people. Q: Senator <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, a minute to respond. Quayle: As you noticed, Senator <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> did n't tell you very much about what Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would do _ Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, one of the most liberal governors in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The one thing he tried to point out about Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is that he's cut taxes The fact of the matter is, Senator <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, he's raised taxes five times. He just raised taxes this last year, and that's why a lot of people refer to him `` Tax Hike <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>. That's why they refer to the state of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> as Taxachusetts. Because every time there's problem the liberal governor from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> raises taxes. I do n't blame Senator <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> for not talking about Governor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>; he's talking more about his record. If I had to defend the liberal policies of Governor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, I would n't talk about it either

<HEAD>Congressman Says Wife `Imagined' Her Brother Had AIDS</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dornan </PERSON> said his wife's mistaken public statement that her brother suffered from AIDS was prompted by worry and imagination, according to a newspaper report published Wednesday <PERSON> Dornan </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Sallie </PERSON>, are `` very relieved and obviously extremely happy,'' that her estranged brother, <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, does n't have the disease, <PERSON> Dornan </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Register </ORGANIZATION> in an interview The comments from <PERSON> Dornan </PERSON>, a Republican who has been critical of the gay lifestyle, apparently did little to end an unusual and highly public family feud. At a public meeting Sept. 18, Mrs. <PERSON> Dornan </PERSON> vividly described the plight of a brother dying of AIDS as she was apologizing for shouting, `` Shut up, fag,'' to a gay activist in the crowd. Asked who the brother was, she said, `` <PERSON> Dougie </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Dornan </PERSON> criticized his brother-in-law, a 51-year-old landscape architect from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, for discussing the matter with the news media. <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> in interviews denied that he is gay and that he suffered from the fatal malady. The congressman said his wife believed it wrong for her brother to go public with his rebuttal of her assertions. `` She thinks <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> owes her an apology for going to the press instead of her,'' <PERSON> Dornan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dornan </PERSON>, seeking re-election to a third term in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said the description stemmed from his wife's worries about her brother and from pictures she had seen of AIDS victims. `` She'd been worrying and it came out as a reality instead of a fear _ that's the one mistake <PERSON> Sallie </PERSON> made,'' <PERSON> Dornan </PERSON> said. `` Sallie is just a walking heart,'' <PERSON> Dornan </PERSON> said. `` I think she had imagined this so often, she thought she had seen them.'' <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> later called reporters to deny he had AIDS. Though he has friends who are homosexual, he said, he belives the gay lifestyle is wrong. <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> tested negative for the AIDS virus in a test arranged by the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said he had n't seen his sister since their mother's funeral in 1983, and <PERSON> Dornan </PERSON> said he has seen <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> only once in 30 years

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Wednesday proposed a $ 3.9 billion `` invest in our children'' plan focusing on school programs and environmental and quality-of-life issues <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said will foster stronger children through `` a family that functions and an environment that motivates.'' The package, including some proposals <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has made before, would be aimed at helping poor people through tax code revisions and Medicaid efforts, and would also include anti-crime and anti-gang sections as well as efforts to remove toxic substances from school environments. A 32-page summary released by the Republican's presidential campaign also includes proposals to require Medicaid coverage for poor children and to give the states $ 10 million for developing programs against hazardous radon gas. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called for a national survey of schools in 1990 to detect and get rid of radon, and also for `` strict standards'' covering manufacturers who use lead in development of consumer products. Although <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in a remark at a <ORGANIZATION> Arapahoe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> that `` I do n't see this problem in terms of money,'' campaign adviser <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Steelman </PERSON> said the entire package would cost about $ 3.9 billion in federal money for the first year of a five-year plan. Included in that figure is a previously announced $ 2.2 billion tax credit program for child care. <PERSON> Steelman </PERSON> said the new Medicaid proposals would amount to some $ 300 million. `` Why are some children still in trouble after 50 years of liberal programs aimed at helping them?'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asked. `` Because liberalism did n't help _ it often made the problem worse.'' The vice president took some time out from his campaign duties to telephone running mate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and wish him well in his debate Wednesday night with Democrat <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, according to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief of staff <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>. During the 10-minute conversation, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, `` Relax, I know it will go well.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been favorably impressed with <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said. `` When the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people get a chance to see the <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> we know they will all be favorably impressed,'' <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said. The vice president watched the debate from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` He's doing good, good opening, right out of the ball park, the <PERSON> Canseco </PERSON> of American politics,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, referring to <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> A's baseball player <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Canseco </PERSON> in describing <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s response to the first question of the debate to a group of reporters he had invited to watch the opening of the event `` He hit it the first answer, home run.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also traveled Wednesday to <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, where the oil industry is struggling through tough times. `` You're back,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a rally. `` <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> is coming strong.'' Promising to decontrol natural gas, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is an opponent of the energy industry but `` is now trying to fool the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people by acting like he cares about the energy industry.'' At the high school in the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Littleton </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` Our future will be as strong tomorrow as our children are today. And our children will be as strong as their education allows. Their eduction will be as strong as their schools. But something more is required: a family that functions and an environment that motivates.'' Included in the plan is a call to phase in affordable Medicaid coverage for pregnant women and infants with incomes up to 185 percent of the poverty level. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also would expand on current Medicaid coverage for children of families with incomes below the poverty level by providing health-care education for those families. The proposals were an elaboration on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s remarks in his first debate with Democratic rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> that he wanted to allow the poor to `` buy into'' Medicaid, said <PERSON> Steelman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would also expand the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant program to provide health and Medicaid information for pregnant women and provide case management `` as an essential component for high risk in teen-age pregnancies that are likely to result in low birth weight.'' He also called for mandatory Medicaid coverage `` of functionally disabled children who would have to be in a hospital or other institution without such coverage for home care.'' In other areas, he called for: _ Mandatory child support levels and enforcement, and a `` nationwide parent locator system'' to track down delinquent parents. _ Case management and counseling to teach parents about health care and nutrition. _ Encouraging states to make drug testing a condition of bail, probation and parole. _ A focus on crime in the schools with creation of a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> anti-gang unit to work with local jurisdictions. _ Legislation to give the federal government concurrent jurisdiction over juveniles committing federal crimes, so that the federal government can act `` if the state fails to vigorously prosecute juveniles.'' _ Housing vouchers to get assistance to low-income families, a system he said would provide three times as much assistance as building housing for the same price. In giving spending projections for the newly announced programs, <PERSON> Steelman </PERSON> said the anti-gang unit portion would run about $ 50 million, new Medicaid for mothers and infants at 185 percent of the poverty level would be $ 300 million with another $ 80 million for case management in Medicaid. The radon and lead programs would cost $ 30 million, and a program to help turn over subsudized housing to tenants would cost $ 80 million, she said.

<HEAD>Eastern Airlines Plane Impounded After Cocaine Found Aboard</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A judge ordered an <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jetliner impounded Wednesday when nearly 20 pounds of cocaine were found aboard, but an airlines spokeswoman said the plane was later allowed to take off. The <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> L-1011 was preparing to leave <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Wednesday morning when police found the cocaine during a routine search, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Civilian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said. A judge ordered the plane impounded until the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, a part of the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, can decide whether the plane should be seized or the airline fined. In <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON> said the plane was allowed to leave after a hearing Wednesday and Flight 505 left four hours behind schedule. `` The plane was confiscated but it was returned to us,'' Ms. <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON> said. She said she did not know if <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> had posted a bond. Ms. <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON> said ground workers found the cocaine in a closet but that company officials could not immediately determine when the drug was placed in the plane. `` It was found by a cleaning crew in the rear of the aircraft near the lavatories, in the cabin,'' she said. The plane arrived in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> Tuesday and had spent night at the airport after arriving from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on Tuesday, the spokeswoman said. The impoundment appeared to be in reaction to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs officials having impounded jets belonging to <ORGANIZATION> Avianca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> several times in the last three years after cocaine was found aboard them in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. Four months ago <ORGANIZATION> Avianca </ORGANIZATION> said it would no longer haul cargo from <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> because of the millions of dollars in fines it has had to pay in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as a result of cocaine being found in its cargo, especially in flower shipments. A few hours before the cocaine was found aboard the Eastern plane Wednesday, police searching cargo on the tarmac of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>'s El Dorado international airport found 83.6 pounds of cocaine in boxes of carnations bound for <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> They were to be loaded aboard a plane flown by <PERSON> Aerosel </PERSON>, a Colombian cargo airline.

 Moderator: <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Margolis </PERSON>, a question for Senator <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. Q: Sen. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, you have claimed that Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the Republicans will raid the Social Security trust fund, and you have vowed to protect it, but as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, you must know that there is something to the argument of your fellow Democrat, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, that some restraint on Social Security growth may be needed, or at least some decision to tax most Social Security benefits as regular income. In fact, you once voted for, and spoke for, a six-month delay on cost-of-living adjustment increases for Social Security. Senator, are n't you and Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> using this issue politically, rather than dealing with it responsibily? <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>: Well, I must say I hate to disappoint my good friend, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, but we have a contract with the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people on Social Security, and <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> is an issue where Sen. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> voted eight times to cut the benefits on Social Security. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> -LRB- interjecting -RRB- That's wrong. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> -LRB- continuing -RRB- When this administration came in and tried to cut the benefits, the minimum benefits _ $ 122 a month for widows, for retirees _ tried to cut the benefits for 62-year-old retirees by 40 percent, tried to do an end-run on Social Security when they first came in after promising not to cut it, to cut it by some 20 billion. And while we were working together to reform the Social Security system and to be certain that that money was going to be there for people when they retired, at that point they tried a $ 40 billion end-run to cut Social Security. Now, the record is clear. And we saw Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> fly back from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> to break a tie in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. He does n't get to vote very often in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> but he made a special trip to come back and vote against a cost of living increase. Now, when you talk about Social Security the people that are going to protect it are the Democrats who brought forth that program. And I think it's very important that we now see these kinds of end-runs by this administration. When they talk about the fact that they're going to continue to cut this budget, I know too well what their track record is. And we should be concerned about that kind of an effort once again after the election is over. Moderator: Sen. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, your response. Quayle: Sen. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, you know that I did not vote to cut Social Security benefits eight times. What I have voted for, and what Sen. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> has voted for, is to delay the cost-of-living adjustments. Sen. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, two times in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, voted to delay the cost-of-living adjustment. The governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> at a governors' conference supported a resolution to delay the cost-of-living adjustment. And, <PERSON> Jon </PERSON>, you're right, they use this for political advantage. What they try to do time and time again is to scare the old people of this country. That's the politics of the past. In 1983, Republicans and Democrats dropped their political swords and, in a bipartisan effort, saved the Social Security system. Republicans and Democrats banded together because we know that this program is not a Republican program, it's not a Democrat program; it's a program for older Americans. And that program is actuarially sound to the turn of this century. MORE

 Moderator: <PERSON> Jon </PERSON>, a question for Senator <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. Q: Senator, since coming to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, you have voted against environmental protection legislation about two-thirds of the time. These include votes against pesticide controls, the toxic waste superfund, and health and safety protection from nuclear wastes. Senator, do you consider yourself an environmentalist? And, if you do, how do you reconcile that with your voting record? Quayle: I have a very strong record on the environment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. I have a record where I voted for the Superfund legislation. I have a record where I voted against my president on the override of the Clean Water Act. I have voted for the major pieces of environmental legislation that have come down and been voted on in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. This administration, and I support this administration in its environmental effort, has moved in the area for the first time to deal with the ozone problem. We now have an international treaty, a treaty that is commonly referred to as the Montreal Treaty. For the first time we are talking about the impact of CO2 to the ozone layer. That's progress for the environment We are committed to the environment. I take my children hiking and fishing, walking in the woods, in the wilderness. Believe me, we have a commitment to preserving the environment. If you bring up the environment, you ca n't help but think about the environmental policy of the governor of <LOCATION> Massachsetts </LOCATION>. He talks about being an environmentalist. Let me tell you about his environmental policy. The <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> which is the dirtiest waterway in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Tons of raw sewage go in there each and every day. What has the governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> done about that? Virtually nothing. Then he has the audacity to go down to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and tell the people in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> that he's against ocean dumping. This is the same governor that applied for a license to dump <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> sewage, waste off the coast of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. Who has the environmental record? Who has the environment interests? <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and I do. Moderator: Senator <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>? <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>: Well this late conversion is interesting to me. When they talk about <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, and he says he has n't done anything, the facts are he has a $ 6 billion program underway on waste treatment, and it was this administration, their administration, that cut out the money early on to be able to clean up water and made it impossible to move ahead at that time on <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. We're the authors, the Democratic party, of <ORGANIZATION> Clean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, of Clean Water, of the Superfunding. I'm one who played a very major role in passing the Superfund legislation. And every environmental organization that I know, every major one has now endorsed the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket. And I'm one who has just received the environmental award in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> for the work I've done to clean up the bays, to clean up the water off the coast of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Now I think we know well who's going to help clean up this environment. The record is there, the history is there and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> will be committed to that.

 Moderator: <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON>, a question for Senator <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. Q: Thank you <PERSON> Judy </PERSON>. Senator <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, there's been a lot of talk during this course of this campaign about family, it was the principle theme as I recall it in your acceptance speech in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. Tonight I'd like to ask you about the 65 million <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> children who live with their families in poverty. I'd like for you to describe to the audience the last time that you may have visited with one of those families personally, and how you explain to that family your votes against the school breakfast program, the school lunch program and the expansion of the child immunization program. Quayle: I have met with those people, and I met with them in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> at a food bank. And you may be surprised <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>, they did n't ask me those questions on those votes because they were glad that I took time out of my schedule to go down and to alk about how we're going to get a food bank going and making sure that a food bank goes to <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. And I have a very good record and a commitment to the poor, to those that do n't have a family, want to have a family. This administration and a <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will be committed to eradicating poverty. Poverty has n't gone up in this administration. It has n't gone down much either, and that means that we have a challenge ahead of us. But let me tell you something, what we have done for the poor. What we have done for the poor is that we, in fact -- the homeless bill -- the McKinney Act, which is a major piece of legislation that deals with the homeless. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has cut the funding that the administration recommended. The poor and poverty -- the biggest thing that we have done for poverty in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is the Tax Simplification Act of 1986. Six million working poor families got off the payroll. Six million people are off the taxpaying payrolls because of that tax reform, and they're keeping the tax money there. To help the poor, we'll have a commitment to the programs, and those programs will go on And we are spending more in poverty programs today than we were in 1981. That is a fact. The poverty program we are going to concentrate on is creating jobs and opportunities so that everyone will have the opportunities that they want. Q: Senator <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, your response. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>: I find that very interesting, because he has been of no help at all when it comes to passing the most major welfare reform bill in the history of our country, one where we're working very hard to see that people can get off welfare, break that cycle, take a step up in life, doing the kinds of things that we did there to let them have Medicaid for a year. That's a positive thing that's done What also frustrates me with the kind of report that I just heard here is the kind of votes he's cast against child nutrition programs, the fact that he has voted against money that we needed for further immunization, the denial of polio shots to kids where the parents could n't afford to get that kind of a shot. Now I do n't really believe that is identifying with the concerns of people in poverty

 Moderator: <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON> -RRB-, a question for Sen. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. Q: Sen. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, I'd like to take you back to the question that <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> -LRB- Woodruff -RRB- asked you about your differences with <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on Contra aid. After all, Contra aid is one of the cutting issues of foreign policy of this country in the last eight years. You and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> seem to be diametrically opposed on that. I have been told that in a closed session of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, you made one of the most eloquent and statesmanlike speeches in behalf of <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> aid that anyone had made in the eight years of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> term; that, in fact, you alluded to the threat the Sandinista regime could pose to your own state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, on the other hand, has described the Contra aid policy as `` immoral and illegal.'' Is he wrong? <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>: Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and I have disagreed on the Contra program -- no question about that. But my big difference with this administration is they look at the Contra aid program as the only way to resolve that problem. The concentrate on that. And I really think we have to give peace a chance. And that's why I've been a strong supporter of the <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> plan, a plan that won the Nobel prize for President <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>, the president of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. I believe that you have to work with the leaders of those other Central American countries to try to bring about the democratization of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> by negotiation, by pressure, by counseling, by diplomatic pressure _ that we ought to be trying that first. But in concentrating so much just on the Contras, this administration has not paid enough attention to the rest of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The concern I have is that we have a country with 85 million people sharing a 2,000-mile border with us with half of those people under the age of 15, a country that has had its standard of living cut 50 percent in the last six years. Now, we ought to be concerned about that and we ought to be involved. I was born and reared on that Mexican border. I speak their language. I spent a good part of my life down there. Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> speaks Spanish, too. He's spent a good deal of time in Central and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. And we believe that we ought to be working together with a new alliance for progress, bringing in other countries to help. Bring in Europeans, the Spanish who have a real affinity for that area. Bringing in the Japanese, who have a great capital surplus now and looking for places to invest it. Those are the policy things I think we could do to bring about peace in that area, to help raise that standard of living and give them the kind of stability where democracy can proceed and can prosper and bloom. Those are the kinds of things that we'd be committed to in a Dukakis_Bentsen administration, to try to make this world a better place in which to live. Moderator: Sen. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, your response. Quayle: There's no doubt, in a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> administration that the aid would be cut off to the democratic resistance in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and that is unfortunate. The reason it is unfortunate _ because it is beyond me why it's okay for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to put in billions of dollars to prop up the communist <PERSON> Sandinistas </PERSON>, but somehow it's wrong for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to give a few dollars to the democratic resistance There's a thing called the <ORGANIZATION> Monroe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Doctrine </ORGANIZATION>, something that the governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> has said has been superseded. I doubt if many Americans agree with that. I think they believe in the Monroe Doctrine. Sen. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> talked about the entire <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. There's another issue that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is wrong on in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and that's <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION>. He criticized our rescue mission in <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION>, according to a <ORGANIZATION> UPI </ORGANIZATION> report _ criticized that, yet 85 percent of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people supported our rescue mission and we turned a communist country into a non-communist country. The Governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> is simply out of step with mainstream American.

 Moderator: <PERSON> Brit </PERSON> <PERSON> Hume </PERSON>, a question for Senator <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. Q: Good evening, Senator <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, Senator <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. I'm sort of the clean-up man in this order, and I've been asked by my colleagues to try to deal with anything that's been left on base. Senator, I have a follow-up question for you, Senator <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. But Senator <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, I first want to ask you a question about PAC money, something I'm sure you're prepared to talk about. Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has tried to make ethics a major issue in the campaign. And he has you as a running mate, a man who leads the league, at last count, in the receipt of <ORGANIZATION> PAC </ORGANIZATION> money _ that being the money raised by the special interest organizations. That is the kind of campaign financing which Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> finds so distasteful that he has refused to accept any of it. Do you find that embarrassing, Senator? <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>: No, I do n't find it embarrassing at all because you have to remember that PAC money is the result of the last campaign reform bill, one that talks about employees have greater participation. And what I've done in PAC money is just what my opponent in my campaign has done in his campaign. He has, he's been raising PAC money, too. So what you have to do is comply with the laws as they are, whether you're paying taxes, or you're playing a football game; whether you like those laws or not you comply with them. Now, I have been for campaign reform and have pushed it very hard. I believe that we have to do some things in that regard. But I've noticed that the Senator from <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> has opposed that campaign reform and voted repeatedly against it. The things we have to do, I believe, that will cut back on `` soft money,'' for example, which I look on as frankly, one of those things that we have had to do because the Republicans have done it for so long, but I think it's a loophole, frankly. But campaign reform, changing the rules of the game, is something we tried repeatedly in this session of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, but only to have the Republicans lead the charge against us and defeat us. And I wish that Senator <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> would change his mind on that particular piece of legislation and give us the kind of a campaign reform law that I think is needed in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Moderator: Senator <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, your response. Quayle: Senator <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is the number one PAC raiser. As a matter of fact, he used to have a $ 10,000 Breakfast Club. A $ 10,000 Breakfast Club. It only cost high-paid lobbyist special interests in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to come down and have breakfast with the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committe </ORGANIZATION> _ the one that oversees all the tax loopholes in the tax code _ $ 10,000. I'm sure they were n't paying to have Corn Flakes. Well I'll tell you the kind of campaign reform I'm supporting, Senator <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, I think it's time that we get rid of PAC money. Support our legislation where we totally eliminate contributions by special interests and political action committees, and let's have the individual contribute and the political parties contribute. That's the kind of campaign reform that Republicans are for. They want to get rid of this special interest money and rely on the individuals, and also the political parties.

 Moderator: Brit, your question for Senator <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. Once again, let me caution the audience: please, keep your reaction as quiet as possible. Brit. Q: Senator, I want to take you back, if I can, to the question <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> asked you about some of the apprehensions people may feel about your being a heartbeat away from the presidency. And let us assume, if we can, for the sake of this question, that you become vice president and the president is incapacitated for one reason or another and you have to take the reins of power. When that moment came, what would be the first steps that you'd take and why? Quayle: First I'd say a prayer for myself and for the country that I'm about to lead. And then I would assemble his people and talk. And I think this question keeps going back to qualifications and what kind of vice president and this hypothetical situation if I had to assume the responsibilities of the president what I would be. And, as I have said, age alone -- although I can tell you, after the experience of these last few weeks on the campaign, I've added 10 years to my age -- age alone is not the only qualification You've got to look at experience, and you've got to look at accomplishments. And can you make a difference? Have I made a difference in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> where I served for eight years? Yes I have. Have I made a difference in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that I served for twelve years? Yes I have. As I said before, looking at the issue of qualifications, and I am delighted that it comes up, because on the three most important challenges facing <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> -- arms control and national security, jobs and education, and budget deficit -- I have more experience and accomplishments than does the governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. I have been in the Congress and I have worked on these issues. And, believe me, when you look at arms control and trying to deal with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, you can not come at it from a naive position. <PERSON> Youy </PERSON> have to understand the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. You have to understand how they will respond. Sitting on that <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> for eight years has given me the experience to deal with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and how we can move forward. That is just one of the troubling issues that's going to be facing this nation. And I am prepared. Q: Senator <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>? <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>: Well, I ca n't leave something on the table that he's charged me with, so let's get to that one When you talk about the `` Breakfast Club,'' as you know that was perfectly legal. And I formed it and I closed it down almost immediately, because I thought the perception was bad. But it's the same law. It's the same law that lets you invite high-priced lobbyists down to <LOCATION> Williamsburg </LOCATION>; and bring them down there and entertain them playing golf, playing tennis and bringing <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> senators down there, to have exchanged for that contributions to their campaign. It's the same kind of law that let's you have honorariums, and you've collected over a quarter of a million dollars of honorariums now, speaking to various interest groups. And there's no control over what you do with that money. You can spend it on anything you want to. You can spend it on golf club dues, if you want to do that. Now that's what I've seen you do in this administration, and that's why we need campaign reform laws and why I support them and you, in turn, have voted against them time and time again.

 Striking Hollywood drivers and three production companies agreed to an order Wednesday barring the drivers from intimidating studio employees and disrupting film and television production. To stem the increasingly violent atmosphere surrounding the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> strike, the <ORGANIZATION> Cannell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> MTM-CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> joined in a temporary restraining order with the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> which was approved by <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> agreed to observe new rules about the size of picket contingents, how close they can come to studio gates and the distance between the marchers and the pace at which they walk so as to not obstruct traffic. The restrictions will be considered more fully at hearing Oct. 18. The walkout, affecting 3,200 drivers, laborers and electricians, began Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> Cannell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> closed down production on its shows `` Hunter'' and `` Sonny Spoon'' on Tuesday after a series of reports of violence, including death threats, physical assaults and slashed tires. Even as the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> and the producers met in court, there were more reports of confrontations. Location filming on the CBS series `` Murder, She Wrote'' was disrupted Wednesday when pickets encouraged passing motorists to honk their horns, according to security guard <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Loust </PERSON>. <PERSON> Loust </PERSON> said that several replacement drivers went home early because they were being harassed by pickets. Teamster officials did not respond to interview requests. The Teamster drivers transport actors, equipment and props for television and film producers. Joining the Teamsters on the picket lines are 1,000 members of two other Basic Crafts unions, the electricians and the laborers. The Hollywood plasterers and the plumbers, the remaining Basic Crafts guilds, are not on strike. Issues in the strike include overtime rules for weekend work, salary rates, wages for out-of-town film and television production, seniority and guidelines for the making of nonunion films. Some drivers are being asked to take a pay cut from $ 16.61 to $ 14 per hour. The producers maintain that the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> must help manage mounting production costs and increased competition. Overall, the contract proposal represents an increase in employment and salaries, the producers say.

<HEAD>Bells Peal Across Brasilia As Brazil Enacts Eighth Constitution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JORGE MEDEROS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Church bells rang in this modernistic capital Wednesday as <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> enacted its eighth constitution, consolidating the switchover from military rule to civilian government that began in 1985. The 559 legislators, who for 19 months battled over the 245-article document, cheered and shouted `` <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> is changing!'' as the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Constituent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Ulysses </PERSON> <PERSON> Guimaraes </PERSON>, declared law the new document. `` I declare enacted the constitution of liberty, of dignity, of democracy and social justice,'' <ORGANIZATION> Guimaraes </ORGANIZATION>, 72, said in a voice that struggled above thunderous applause. `` May God help us enforce it.'' <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s new democratic charter leaves behind the old authoritarian document that was handed down by military generals in 1969. The enactment was the last step in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s return to fully democratic rule begun in March 1985, when <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> became <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s first civilian president since a 1964 right-wing military coup. `` We have created a new <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, a new social and economic order,'' <PERSON> Dante </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliveira </PERSON> of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said after the ceremony. `` We have taught the world an important lesson, peacefully overturning an authoritarian regime.'' The new document, a mixture of left-leaning, conservative and nationalistic articles that touch almost all aspects of life from land reform to interest rates, granted none of the arbitrary powers used by the repressive military government during 21 years to rule the country. The new charter bans censorship, removes the president's power to simply decree law and outlaws torture, which in the past was used against the military government's political opponents. But many of the articles were confusing. Several such as a reduced work week, more maternity leave and extra pay for overtime immediately became law; 154 would need complimentary legislation to become effective. One such confusing article limited `` real'' interest rates to 12 percent though no one knows what `` real'' interest rates in inflation-ridden <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> are. Inflation in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> is averaging more than 350 percent over the last 12 months. One of the most controversial articles fought over by legislators, who shouted each other down in day-long debates and often resorted to physical violence, set presidential elections in November 1989. Brazilians have n't voted for president since 1960. Representatives from 21 Latin American and Portuguese-speaking nations watched legislators enact <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s eighth constitution since the country gained independence from <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> in 1822.

 Moderator: <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Margolis </PERSON>, question for Sen. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. Q: Sen. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, in recent years the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has scaled back the activities of the <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, prompted in part by Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s task force on regulatory relief. The budget for the agency has been cut by 20 percent, and the number of inspections at manufacturing plants have been reduced by 33 percent. This has had a special effect in this area where many people work in the meat-packing industry, which has a far higher rate of serious injuries than almost any other injury, a rate which appears to have been rising, although we're not really sure because some of the largest companies have allegedly been falsifying their reports. Would you acknowledge to the hundreds of injured and maimed people in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, and elsewhere in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> that, in this case, deregulation may have gone too far and the government should reassert itself in protecting workers' rights? Quayle: The premise of your question, <PERSON> Jon </PERSON>, is that somehow this administration has been lax in enforcement of the <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> regulations, and I disagree with that, and I'll tell you why. If you want to ask some business people that I've talked to periodically, they complain about the tough enforcement of this administration. And furthermore, let me tell you this for the record, when we have found violations in this administration there has not only been tough enforcement, but there have been the most severe penalties _ the largest penalties in the history of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> _ have been levied when these violations have been found. There is a commitment, and there will always be a commitment, to the safety of our working men and women. They deserve it, and we're committed to them Now, the broader question goes to the whole issue of deregulation, and has deregulation worked or has deregulation not worked? In my judgment, deregulation has worked. We have a deregulated economy and we have produced through low taxes, not high taxes, through deregulation, the spirit of entrepreneurship, the individual going out and starting a business, the businessman or woman willing to go out and risk their investment and start up a business and hire people _ we have produced 17 million jobs in this country since 1982. Deregulation as a form of political philosophy is a good philosophy. It's one that our opponents disagree with. They want a centralized government. But we believe in the market; we believe in the people. And yes, there's a role of government and the role of government is to make sure that those safety and health and welfare of the people is taken care of. And we'll continue to do that. Moderator: Sen. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>? <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>: I think you see once again a piece of Democratic legislation that's been passed to try to protect the working men and women of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. And then you've seen an administration that came in and really did n't have its heart in that kind of an enforcement. A good example of that is the environmental protection laws that we were talking about a moment ago. This administration came in and put in a <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Watt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorsuch </PERSON>. Now that's the <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON>, really, of environmental protection. And that's why it's important that you have people that truly believe, and trying to represent the working men and women of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> Most employers do a good job of that, but some of them put their profits before people. And that's why you have to have <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION>, and that's why you have to have tough and good and fair enforcement of it. And that's what a Democratic administration would do to help make this working place a safer and a better place to be employed. Moderator: <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Margolis </PERSON>, another question for Senator <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. Q: Sen. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, since you have been in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, the government has spent increasing amounts of money in an effort to protect the family farmer. But most of the subsidies seem to go, do go, to the largest and richest farmers, who presumably need it least, while it's the smaller farmers who are often forced to sell out, sometimes to their large farmer neighbor who's gotten more subsidies to begin with. Despite the fact that I believe you, sir, are rather a large farmer yourself, do you believe it's time to uncouple the subsidy formula from the amount of land a farmer has and target federal money to the small - and medium-size farmer <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>: Well, I've supported that. I voted for the 50,000 limitation to get away from the million dollar contributions to farmers. You know, of the four that are on this ticket, I'm the only one that was born and reared on a farm, and still involved in farming. So I think I understand their concerns and their problems. Now, I feel very strongly that we ought to be doing more for the American farmer, and what we've seen under this administration is neglect of that farmer. We've seen them drive 220,000 farmers off the farm. They seem to think the answer is, `` Move'em to town.'' But we ought not to be doing that. What you have seen them do is cut farm assistance for the rural areas by over 50 percent. We're seeing rural hospitals close all over the country because of this kind of an administration. We've seen an administration that has lost much of our market abroad because they have not had a trade policy. We saw our market lost by some 40 percent. And that's one of the reasons that we've seen the cost of the farm program, which was only about $ 2.5 billion when they took office, now go to about $ 25 billion. Now we can bring that kind of a cost down and get more to market prices if we'll have a good trade policy. I was, in January, visiting with Mr. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, the new prime minister of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. I said, `` You're paying five times as much for beef as we pay for in our country -- pay for it in our country -- six times as much for rice. You have a $ 60 billion trade surplus with us. You could improve the standard of living of your people. You're spending 27 percent of your disposable income on food. We spend 14 or 15 percent. When you have that kind of a barrier up against us, that's not free and fair trade, and we do n't believe that should continue. We would be pushing very hard to open up those markets, and stand up for the American farmer. And see that we recapture those foreign markets, and I think we can do it with a Dukakis-Bentsen administration. Moderator: Sen. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. Quayle: Sen. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> talks about recapturing the foreign markets. Well, I'll tell you one way that we're not going to recapture the foreign markets, and that is if, in fact, we have another <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> grain embargo. <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> -- <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> grain embargo -- <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> grain embargo set the American farmer back. You know what the farmer is interested in? Net farm income. Every 1 percent of increase in interest rates -- a billion dollars out of the farmer's pocket. Net farm income -- increase inflation another billion dollars. Another thing that a farmer's not interested in and that's supply management the Democratic platform talks about But, the governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, he had the farm program. He went to the farmers in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, and told them not to grow corn, not to grow soy beans, but to grow <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> endive. That's what his -- that's what he and his <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> buddies think of the American farmer Grow <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> endive. To come in and to tell our farmers not to grow corn, not to grow soy beans, that's the kind of farm policy you'll get under a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> administration, and one I think the American farmer rightfully will reject

 Moderator: <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON>, a question for Senator <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>? Q: Senator <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, you were a business man before you entered the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Let me offer you an inventory, if I may: lower interest rates, lower unemployment, lower inflation, and arms control deal with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Now, two guys come through your door at your business, and say, `` We'd like you to change,'' without offering a lot of specifics.'' Why would you accept their deal? <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>: You know, if you let me write $ 200 billion worth of hot checks every year, I could give you an illusion of prosperity, too. This is an administration that has more than doubled the national debt, and they've done that in less than eight years. They have taken this country from the number one lender nation in the world to the number one debtor nation in the world. And the interest on that debt next year, on this Reagan-Bush debt of our nation, is going to be $ 640 dollars for every man, woman and child in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, because of this kind of a credit card mentality. So, we go out and we try to sell our securities, every week, and hope that the foreigns will buy them. And they do buy them, but every time they do, we lose some of our economic independence for the future. Now they've turned around and they've bought 10 percent of the manufacturing base of this country. They bought 20 percent of the banks. They own 46 percent of the commercial real estate in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. They're buying <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> on the cheap. Now when we have other countries that ca n't manage their economy down in Central and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, we send down the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> ambassador. We send down the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> and we tell them what they can buy and what they can sell and how to run their economies. The ultimate irony would be to have that happen to us because foreigners finally quit buying our securities. So what we need in this country is someone like <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> who gave 10 balanced budgets in a row there and was able to do that, meet that kind of a commitment, set those tough priorities. We need an administration that will turn this trade policy around and open up those markets, stand tough with our trading partners to help keep the jobs at home and send the products abroad. Moderator: Senator <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>? Quayle: Senator <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> talks about running up the debt. Well the governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> has run up more debt than all the governors in the history of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> combined going back to the days of the Pilgrims. I do n't believe that that's the kind of policy that we want. The question went to the heart of the matter, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>. You asked the question that why would we change? Well we have changed since 1980. We've got interest rates down. We got inflation down. People are working again. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is held in respect once again around the world. But we're going to build on that change. And as we made those positive change of lower interest rates, lower rate of inflation, the governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> fought us every step of the way. We are proud of the record of accomplishment and the opportunities and the hope for millions of Americans _ hope and opportunity of these Americans is because of the policies that we have had for the last eight years and we want to build on that and change it for even the better. Moderator: <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>, a question for Senator <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. Q: Senator <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as you mention here tonight, you actively supported the invasion of <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> which was the military operation to rescue some American medical students and to rescue an island from a Marxist takeover. If military force was necessary in that endeavor, why not use the military to go after the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> drug cartels and after General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> for that matter on a surgical strike, since drugs in the minds of most Americans pose a far greater danger to many more people? <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>: You're absolutely right. You're absolutely right the drug problem is the number one issue. Q: But would you please address the military aspect of it? Quayle: I will address the military aspect if I may respond. The military aspect of the drug problem is being addressed. As a matter of fact, we are using the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> in a coordinated effort on reconnaissance, but I do n't believe that we're going to turn the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> into a police organization. We are using our military assets in a prudent way to deal with interdiction. And we've made some success in this area. Seventy tons of cocaine have been stopped. But, you know, when you look at the drug problem, and it is a tremendous problem and there are no easy solutions to it, it's a complicated problem. And it's heading up the effort to try to create a drug-free <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, which is a challenge and a goal of all of us. Not only will we utilize national defense and the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>, but we've got to get on the demand side of the ledger. We've got to get to education, and education ought to begin at home, and it ought to be reinforced, reinforced in our schools. And there's another thing that will be more important than the premise of this question on a hypothetical of using troops. We'll use military assets We're not going to, we'll use military assets, but we need to focus on another part of this problem, and that problem is law enforcement. And here's where we have a major disagreement with the governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. He is opposed to the death penalty for drug kingpins. We believe people convicted of that crime deserve the death penalty, as does the legislation that's in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that's supported by a bipartisan group, including many Democrats of his party. He also was opposed to mandatory drug sentencing for drug dealers in the state of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. You can not have a war on drugs, you can not be tough on drugs and weak on crime. Moderator: Senator <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>: It's interesting to see that the senator from <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, when we had a resolution on the floor of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> sponsored by Senator <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, that this government would make no deal with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, that the senator from <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> was one of the dozen senators that voted against it. It's also interesting to see that one of his campaign managers that's trying to help him with his image, was also hired by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to help him with his image in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. What we have seen under this administration, we have seen them using eight Cabinet officers, 28 different agencies, all fighting over turf. And that's one thing we'd correct under the Dukakis-Bentsen administration. We'd put one person in charge in the war against drugs, and we'd commit the resources to get that job done. Now, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been able to do that type of thing in the state of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> by cutting the drug use in high schools while it's going up around the rest of the country, by putting in a drug educational program that the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said was a model for the country. We'd be doing that around the rest of the country. That's a positive attack against drugs.

 Moderator: <PERSON> Brit </PERSON> <PERSON> Hume </PERSON>, a question for Senator <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. Q: Senator, I want to take you back to the question that I asked you earlier about what would happen if you were to take over in an emergency and what you would do first and why. You said you'd say a prayer and you said something about a meeting. What would you do next? Quayle: I do n't believe that it's proper for me to get into the specifics of a hypothetical situation like that. The situation is that if I was called upon to serve as the president of this country, or the responsibilities of the president of this country, would I be capable and qualified to do that? And I've tried to list the qualifications of 12 years in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. I have served in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for 12 years; I have served in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and served eight years on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. I have traveled a number of times; I've been to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> many times to meet with our negotiators as we were hammering out the INF Treaty. I've met with the Western political leaders -- <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, Chancellor <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> -- I know them; they know me. I know what it takes to lead this country forward. And if that situation arises, yes, I will be prepared, and I'll be prepared to lead this country if that happens. Q: Senator <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>: Well once again, I think what we're looking at here is someone that can step in at the presidency level at the moment, if that tragedy would occur. And if that's the case, again you have to look at maturity of judgment, and you have to look at breadth of experience. You have to see what kind of leadership roles that person has played in his life before that crisis struck him. And if you do that type of thing, then you'll arrive at a judgment that I think would be wise one, and I hope that would mean that you say, `` We're going to vote for <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>.'' Moderator: Brit, a question for Senator <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. Q:: Senator, I want to take you back, if I can, to the celebrated `` breakfast club.'' When it was first revealed that you had a plan to have people pay $ 10,000 a plate to have breakfast with you, you handled it with disarming, not to say charming, candor. You said it was a mistake and you disbanded it and called the whole idea off, and you were widely praised for having handled it deftly. The question I have is, if the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> had not broken that story and other media picked up on it, what can you tell us tonight as to why we should not believe that you would still be having those breakfasts to this day? <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>: -LRB- Laughs -RRB- Well, I must say, Brit, I do n't make many mistakes, but that one was a real doozie. And I agree with that. And, as you know, I immediately disbanded it; it was perfectly legal. And you have all kinds of such clubs on the Hill, and you know that. And -- but I still believe that the better way to go is to have a campaign reform law that takes care of that kind of a situation. Even though it's legal, the perception is bad. So I would push very strong to see that we reform the entire situation. I'd work for that end and that's what my friend from <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> has opposed repeatedly, vote after vote. Moderator: Senator <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>? Quayle: He disbanded the club, but he's still got the money. He is the number one receiver of political action committee money. Now, Senator <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s talked about reform. Well, let me tell you about the reform that we're pushing. Let's eliminate political action committees to special interest money. There's legislation before the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to do that. That way we wo n't have to worry about breakfast clubs or who's the number one PAC raiser. We can go back and get the contributions from the working men and women and the individuals of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. We can also strengthen our two-party system, and it needs strengthening, and rely more on the political parties than we have in the past. That's the kind of campaign reform that I'm for, and I hope the senator will join me.

<HEAD>Ex-Wife: Chambers Killed Bean During Fight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KEENE, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Former <PERSON> Marlow </PERSON> police chief <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> killed his drinking buddy with a hatchet when the man tried to protect <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>' estranged wife, she said in an interview published Wednesday. As he lay dying outside Chambers' home on Sept. 15, 1978, <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Bean </PERSON>, then 25, looked at <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Wentworth </PERSON>, told her to take care of his children, and said he loved his wife, <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wentworth </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Keene </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sentinel </ORGANIZATION>. Chambers declined to comment on the account, referring the Sentinel's questions to his lawyer, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisti </PERSON>, who also declined to comment. Since Bean's skeletal remains were unearthed in March in Chambers' front yard, <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, 36, has said only six words publicly about the case: `` I did not kill <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> <PERSON> Bean </PERSON>.'' He was arrested April 15. <PERSON> Sisti </PERSON> tried to bar the state from presenting <PERSON> Wentworth </PERSON>'s testimony to a grand jury in May, questioning her competence and citing a history of psychiatric treatment <PERSON> Wentworth </PERSON> testified to the grand jury that prosecutors asked to issue a murder indictment. The grand jury, whose proceedings are secret, returned no indictment, leaving Chambers a free man. He is living with a policeman-friend in <LOCATION> Hinsdale </LOCATION> and working as a logger, the job he held 10 years ago. Phones calls to the residence went unanswered. <PERSON> Wentworth </PERSON> also could not be reached. Police, acting on tips from Chambers' relatives, began digging in his front yard on March 11. They told police that <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>' father, <PERSON> Clifton </PERSON>, told them <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> came to him one night 10 years ago and said he had accidentally killed Bean in a fight, and that father and son had buried the body with a backhoe. <PERSON> Clifton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> died of a cerebral hemorrhage March 9. Bean's body was uncovered on March 14 and an autopsy indicated he was struck with something, but authorities have never said what. When Chambers' relatives told them Bean was killed with a hatchet that was thrown into a quarry, police later drained the quarry, but found nothing. Chambers has resigned as <PERSON> Marlow </PERSON>'s part-time police chief, a job he held three years. The Sentinel said it interviewed <PERSON> Wentworth </PERSON>, 36, as well as investigators whom it did not identify and many of the people interviewed by police in their investigation. Not long after <PERSON> Bean </PERSON>'s death, his wife <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> and her three children moved in with <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, whom <PERSON> Wentworth </PERSON> had left several months earlier with Chambers' two sons. <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Bean </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> subsequently married, though she moved out and filed for divorce after Bean's body was dug up. According to the paper, <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> _ then married to Bean _ said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> and her husband went out drinking and partying constantly until she finally told Bean it had to stop. She said he agreed, but that on Sept. 15, 1978, Bean left with Chambers around 6 p.m. According to <PERSON> Wentworth </PERSON> and sources familiar with her grand jury testimony, <PERSON> Wentworth </PERSON> hitchhiked with suitcases to Chambers' rural home that evening. Chambers and Bean arrived a few minutes later, and when <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> saw her, he got angry and called her vulgar names. Bean tried to come to her defense, she told the paper, but <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> pushed her toward Bean, saying he could have her, an apparent reference to an affair Bean and <PERSON> Wentworth </PERSON> had had earlier. <PERSON> Wentworth </PERSON> told the paper that when Bean stepped between her and <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, Chambers picked up a hatchet and hit Bean several times in the head and once in the chest. She told the Sentinel that <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> then forced her into his truck, threw her suitcases in back, and drove her the short distance to <LOCATION> Newell </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pond </LOCATION>, where he beat her again, threatened her and left. Again a motorist picked her up. `` If I can find whoever picked her up, I hope -LRB- <LOCATION> Wentworth </LOCATION> -RRB- told them something,'' Sgt. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rondo </PERSON>, chief state police investigator in the case, told the Sentinel. Police investigated Bean's disappearance, but closed the case, assuming Bean abandoned his family.

 Moderator: <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Margolis </PERSON>, a question for Sen. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. Q: Senator, we've all just finished _ most <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has just finished one of the hottest summers it can remember, and apparently this year will be the fifth out of the last nine that are among the hottest on record. No one knows, but most scientists think that something we're doing, human beings are doing, are -LRB- sic -RRB- exacerbating this problem and that this could, in a couple of generations, threaten our descendents' comfort and health and perhaps even their existence. As vice president, what would you urge our government to do to deal with this problem? And specifically, as a Texan, could you support a substantial reduction in the use of fossile fuel, which might be necessary down the road? <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>: Well, I think what you can do in that one, and which would be very helpful, is to use a lot more natural gas, which burns a lot cleaner. And what <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has said is that he'll try to break down those regulatory roadblocks that you have in the regulatory agency that denies much of the passage of that natural gas to the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, where you, in turn, can fight against acid rain, which is another threat because it's sterilizing our lakes, it's killing our fish And it's interesting to me to see in the resume of Sen. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> that he brags on the fact that he's been able to fight the acid rain legislation. I do n't think that that's a proper objective in trying to clean up this environment. But the greenhouse effect is one that has to be a threat to all of us, and we have to look for alternative sources of fuel, and I've supported that very strongly. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> is one that has cut back substantially on the study of those alternative sources of fuel. We can use other things that'll help the farmer. We can convert corn to ethanol, and I would push for that very strong. So absolutely, I'll do those things that are necessary to put the environment of our country number one, because if we do n't protect that, we'll destroy the future of our children, and we must be committed to trying to clean up the water, clean up the air, and do everything we can not only from a research standpoint, but also in the applied legislation to see that that's carried out. Moderator: Sen. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>? Quayle: Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said that he will take on the environmental problem. He has said further that he will deal with the acid rain legislation and reduce millions of tons of the SO-2 content. That legislation wo n't get through the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> this year, but it will get through in a <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, a <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration that is committed to the environment. Now the greenhouse effect is an important environmental issue. It is important for us to get the data in, to see what alternatives we might have to the fossil fuels, to make sure that we know what we're doing. And there are some explorations and things that we can consider in this area. The drought highlighted the problem that we have. And, therefore, we need to get on with it. And in a <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, you can bet that we will. Moderator: A question for Sen. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. Q: Senator, as vice president, your most important contribution would be the advice you gave the president. One of the most troubling facts that's going to face the new administration is the fact that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has now become the world's largest debtor nation. In 1987, foreigners underwrote our debts to the tune of about $ 138 billion. Last week, a top official of the <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> bragged that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> now is in a position to influence the value of the dollar, of our interest rates, and even our stock prices, and he warned that one day maybe they'd do just that. If you were vice president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> did that, what would you tell the president to do? Quayle: When you look at dealing with this total problem -- not just with the Japanese, but the underlying question on this total world debt problem -- you have got to see why are we a debtor and what is attracting the foreign investment into our country today, whether it's the Japanese or others. I would rather have people come over here and to make investments in this country rather than going elsewhere, because by coming over here and making investments in this country, we are seeing jobs. Do you realize that today we are producing Hondas and exporting Hondas to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>? We are the envy of the world. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> -- some of Sen. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s supporters laugh at that. They laugh at that, because they do n't believe that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is the envy of the world. Well, I can tell you, the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people think the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is the envy of the world. Moderator: Sen. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> -- oh, I'm sorry, go ahead. Quayle: We are the greatest nation in this world and the greatest economic power. Now, there's been some talk in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about forgiveness of debt. Forgiveness of debt is wrong. Forgiveness of international debt would be counterproductive. And I'd like to see those that talk about forgiving debt, Senator <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, to go out and talk about the farmer that's in debt that does n't have his forgiven. That's not the kind of policy <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will have. Moderator: Sen. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>: Well, I've told you what I'd do about trade and trying to help turn that situation around. But we also should do is get them to give us more burden-sharing when it comes to national defense. We have a situation today where on a per capita basis, people in western <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> are spending about one third as much as we are in our country. And then when you go to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, where we're spending 6 -LCB- percent on defense of the democracies, they're spending 1 percent I met with some of the Japanese business leaders, talking to them about it. And I said, `` You know, we have 50,000 troops here in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, protecting the democracies of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. And it costs $ 3.5 billion a year. You're the number two economic power in the world. You ought to measure up to that responsibility and carry some of that cost.'' I said, `` If we were not doing what we're doing, we'd have a big budget surplus.'' And I said, `` You'd have chaos, because you get 55 percent of your oil from the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and you would n't have the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> down there to take care of that.'' Now, the senator from <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, when we passed a resolution in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to ask for burden-sharing on that cost to keep those sea lanes open from the Japanese, he voted against that. I do n't understand that

 Moderator: <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON>, a question for Senator <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. Q: Senator Quayle, I do n't mean to beat this drum until it has no more sound left in it, but to follow up on <PERSON> Brit </PERSON> <PERSON> Hume </PERSON>'s question, when you said that it was a hypothetical situation, it is sir, after all the reason that we're here tonight, because you are running not just for vice president. And if you cite the experience that you had in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, surely you must have some plan in mind about what you would do if it fell to you to become president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as it has to so many vice presidents just in the last 25 years or so. Quayle: Let me try to answer the question one more time. I think this is the fourth time that I have had this question and _ Q: Third time. Quayle: Three times, that I've had this question and I'll try to answer it again for you as clearly as I can because the question you're asking is `` What kind of qualifications does <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> have to be president?'' What kind of qualifications do I have and what would I do in this kind of a situation? And what would I do in this situation? I would make sure that the people in the Cabinet and the people and advisors to the president are called. I'll talk to them and I'll work with them. And I will know them on a first-hand basis, because as vice president, I'll sit on the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and I'll know them on a first-hand basis because I'm going to be coordinating the drug effort. I'll know them on a first-hand basis because Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is going to recreate the <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and I'll be in charge of that. I will have day-to-day activities with all the people in government. And then if that unfortunate situation happens, if that situation which would be very tragic happens, I will be prepared to carry out the responsibilities of the presidency of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. And I will be prepared to do that. I will be prepared not only because of my service in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, but because of my ability to communicate and to lead. It is not just age, it's accomplishments, it's experience. I have far more experience than many others that sought the office of vice president of this country. I have as much experience in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> did when he sought the presidency. I will be prepared to deal with the people in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration if that unfortunate event would ever occur. Moderator: Senator <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>? <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>: Senator, I served with <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. I knew <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. What has to be done in a situation like that, -LRB- Applause -RRB- in a situation like that is to call in the joint _ Moderator: Please, please, once again you're only taking time away from your own candidates. Quayle: That was really uncalled for Senator. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>: You're the one that was making the comparison, Senator, and I'm one who knew him well. And frankly, I think you're so far apart in the objectives you choose for your country that I did not think the comparison was well taken. Moderator: <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>, a question for Senator <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. Q: Since you seem to be taking no hostages on the stage, let me ask you a question about the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> _ nine still in brutal captivity in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. Senator <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> you have been critical of the Iran-Contra affair. But tell me, does the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket have any realistic plan for getting the American hostages being held in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> released in any due time? <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>: <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>, that's one of the toughest problems that any chief executive will face because you ca n't help but have the sympathy for that family and for those hostages in themselves. But the one thing we ought to have, know by now is that you ca n't go out and make secret deals with the Ayatollah. You ca n't trade arms for hostages. When you try to do that there's no question but what you just encourage more taking of hostages. And that's been the result by this dumb idea that was cooked out, cooked up in the White House basement. And I want to tell you that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, attending 17 of those meetings and having no record of what he said _ if <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was in those meetings, you would certainly hear from him, and no one would be asking, `` Where is <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>?'' Because I would be making, I would be saying, `` That's a dumb idea and now let's put an end to it.'' And I would speak up on that type of thing. So all you can do on that is to continue to push, use every bit of diplomatic pressure you can, what you can do in the way of economic pressure in addition to that. And that's what you strive to do to have a successful release, finally, of those hostages. But not to encourage more taking of hostages. Moderator: Senator <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>? Quayle: There's no doubt about it that arms for hostages is wrong, and it will never be repeated. We learn by our mistakes. But there have been a number of successes in foreign policy in this administration. But the question goes to a very difficult one: How do you do it? No one has the answer. If they did we'd, we'd certainly do it But we wo n't keep trying, we'll keep trying, we'll keep the doors open And hopefully some day <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, and others who control those hostages, will want to return to civilized international community. And they can do that starting now by releasing those hostages that are held illegally.

 One question, asked time and time again, towered over all others in Wednesday night's vice presidential debate between <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>: could the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator allay doubts about his qualifications for the office? The question showed <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> at his most prepared, looking straight into the camera, his gestures under control, citing his 12-year record in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` I have more experience and accomplishments than does the governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>,'' he said, referring to Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. As the debate progressed, the qualifications question came up again and again and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> responded each time without an obvious misstep. You could almost hear <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sigh with relief. Did you see anything that made you wince, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> was asked immediately after the debate. `` I did n't see anything that made we wince. When you think about what might have happened, we have to be pretty happy,'' he said. If the winner of this debate were determined by advance expectations, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had a claim to victory. He walked on stage with both his supporters and opponents wondering if he would stumble badly. He disappointed those who hoped he would. But it was not clear whether <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> eliminated the doubts. That may not be known until Americans vote on Nov. 8. How he came across to the millions of TV viewers could be critical in determining which ticket gets the support of the large number of undecided voters. Poll after national poll indicated that voters had questions about <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s qualifications. By contrast, few Americans questioned <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s ability to assume the presidency if called upon. When <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> compared his experience to that of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, it precipitated the sharpest clash of the 90-minute debate. `` <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was a friend of mine,'' said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, looking at his 41-year-old opponent. `` Senator, you're no <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>.'' `` That was uncalled for, senator,'' retorted <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. The format helped. All the questions were asked by a panel of four journalists. The candidates had no opportunity to question each other directly. But the panel kept the focus on the qualifications issue. Four times <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was asked to cite his qualifications or say what he would do if suddenly he became president. `` I do n't mean to beat this drum until it has no more sound,'' said <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> anchorman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON> as he raised the question once again. Obviously prepared for the question, the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator looked straight into the camera and declared that `` age alone is not the only qualification.'' He cited his involvement in congressional debates on defense and arms control, his authorship of job training legislation and his service on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. During his minute to respond to the same question, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> sought to up the stakes, to turn the question not to qualifications for the No. 2 job. `` The debate tonight is about the presidency itself,'' he said. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> took some heat himself on the question of his differences with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on several major issues such as aid to the contra rebels in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, gun control, abortion, and the death penalty. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator was asked whose agenda he would follow if he became president. He never responded to that question. Instead, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> gave his stock answer, saying that `` we agree on so many things, on the vast majority of the issues.'' The Texan also had to respond to questions about his `` Breakfast Club,'' a short-lived fund-raising device under which lobbyists paid $ 10,000 for the privilege of having breakfast with the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. When the existance of the club was publicized, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> dropped it.

 Moderator: <PERSON> Brit </PERSON> <PERSON> Hume </PERSON>, a question for Senator <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. Q: Senator, much of the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> campaign of late has been devoted to the notion that Senator <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is n't ready for the vice presidency and perhaps the presidency. And certainly nothing that you have said here tonight suggests that you think otherwise. I wonder if you think it's really fair for you to advance that view in light of the fact that you ran for the presidency, not the vice presidency, in 1976, having not yet completed one full term in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and having previously served three terms in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> almost a quarter of a century earlier, when in fact your time in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was about equal to what he has now? <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>: Well, I think what you have to look at is the record of a man who has served his country -- served his country in war, headed up a squadron in combat, a man who built a business, knew what it was to meet a payroll, create jobs, and then serve in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>; and one who has been able to bring about some of the kinds of legislation that I've been able to bring about in my service there. I must say I did n't do a very good job of running for the presidency, and I'm well aware of that. But what we're looking at today is trying to judge, once again, the breadth of experience and the maturity of someone taking on this kind of a task. That's the judgment that has to be exercised by the people of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. It's a presidential decision that you're facing, and it's a very important one, because we're talking about who's going to lead this country into its future, and you ca n't have a more important responsibility than that one. Q: Senator <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>? Quayle: When you look at qualifications, you look at accomplishments as well as experience. And one of the accomplishments that I'm proudest of is the authorship of the Job Training Partnership Act that has trained and educated and employed over 3 million young people and adults that are economically disadvantaged. And we did it in a way that we got the private sector to involve itself with the public sector on Private Industry Councils throughout <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that serve over the service delivery areas. We have 51 percent of that <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> that are businessmen and women; we have members of unions; we have community-based organizations; we have education leaders. And what we've been able to do is establish a program that's working, that's putting people back to work That is an accomplishment, and that is an accomplishment that I will take with me into the White House. Moderator: Brit, a question for Senator <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. Q: Senator, I want to ask you a question, and it may be a little off the subject of politics, it's aimed to get more at the question of what sort of person you are. I hope that, Senator <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, if you choose to, you might choose to answer the same question in your rebuttal time. Senator, can you identify any work of literature or art, or even a film that you have seen or read or experienced anywhere in the last two years that has had a particularly strong effect on you, and tell us why? Quayle: In the last six months I think there are three very important books that I read that have had an impact. The three books are: one, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s `` Victory in 1999,'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON>'s -- Senator <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON>'s `` Letters to the Next President,'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Massey </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Alexandra </PERSON> -- `` <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alexandra </PERSON>,'' which deals with the fall of the Russian empire and the coming of Leninism in 1917. Those three books, which I read over the last spring vacation and early summer, had a very definite impact because what former President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and Senator <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON> were talking about was a foreign policy as we move toward the 21st century. And the historical book of the downfall of the Czar and the coming of Leninism -- combining those three books together gave me a better appreciation of the challenges that we have ahead of us. In Senator <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON>'s book he talks about the advancement of human rights around the world. He talked about his leadership effort in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, where we now see human rights and advancement of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> agenda. Former President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> talked about what we're going to do after detente and arms control, and how we're going to pursue new arms control with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. He talked a little bit about how we deal with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. And this is one of the differences between <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, because <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> understands to deal with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and to get progress, you must deal from a position of strength. And the governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> does n't understand that. I understand it, and a <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will pursue that policy. Q: Senator <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>? <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>: I think reading -- pardon me -- I think reading `` Winds of War'' and `` Guns of August'' back to back, I think that really shows you how we make the same mistakes too often, over and over again. And it seems to me that the senator from <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> is beginning to do that one. As I look on the progress that's been made toward disarmament and cutting back on nuclear weapons, and see what <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has been able to do with the INF Treaty -- and I think he deserves great credit for that one -- I see a situation where the senator from <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> has now jumped off the reservation when we talk about building on what <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has done, and opposes what <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> wants to do, the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION> and the secretary of defense, and says, `` Let's go slow on doing further disarmament and trying to get to the next treaty.'' I think that's a mistake. I think that you have to deal with the Russians from strength, and we have to understand that you have to have a strong modernized nuclear deterrent. But I think we can make substantial progress, and we ought to take advantage of it. I think he's arrived at a very dangerous judgment in the question of war and peace, and it concerns me very much, because I saw him also try to sabotage the INF Treaty when it was on the floor of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, with what he was doing there. He's listening once again -- Moderator: Senator -- <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>: to the winds of the radical right. My light was still on, <PERSON> Judy </PERSON>.

 Organizers scorned criticism of the staging of Wednesday night's debate between <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> as `` a lot of nonsense'' which ignores the reality that the event is essentially a television show. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Fouhy </PERSON>, executive producer of the 90-minute confrontation between the two vice presidential candidates, says it's his business to fret about such seemingly trivial details as camera angles and the height of lecterns on the stage of the Omaha Civic Auditorium. `` This is a television program, and we've got some of the best production people in the world doing it,'' <PERSON> Fouhy </PERSON> said. Sharing <PERSON> Fouhy </PERSON>'s concerns are the Democratic and Republican contenders' campaign managers, who were eager to exploit the TV format to best advantage. In the past week of mock debates and briefings for the candidates, the medium was truly the message. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, for example, who is accustomed to the leisurely pace of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> debate, spent days struggling _ with limited success _ to distill his debating points into those punchy, quotable `` sound bites'' that TV demands. About an hour into their debate, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> unleashed what he had learned. When <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> summoned up the name of former President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> stared and him and said sternly: `` You're no <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>.'' The two warmed up with mild-by-comparison jabs over campaign finances, but in general the two candidates stuck to carefully scripted performances from the moment they strode onto the red, white and blue decorated stage. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON>, press secretary for the 67-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> senator from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, said before the debate that <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was having trouble observing the strict time limits specified for the debate _ two-minute answers to questions and one-minute rebuttals. `` The red light goes off frequently,'' <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, 41, seems more comfortable in a TV setting, has been coached by <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s media mastermind, <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Ailes </PERSON>. Deflecting reporters' questions about his debate strategy, the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator said confidently that they should `` tune in and find out.'' During the debate, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> stood casually with one foot propped on the podium, his face occasionally tightening when the audience laughed at a defense of his environmental record and during several tough questions tossed at him by panelists. The League of Women Voters withdrew as sponsors of the second scheduled debate between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Democratic nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> in mid-October, complaining that campaign strategists had turned the event into a `` charade'' by grabbing tight control of the mechanics of TV coverage. <PERSON> Fouhy </PERSON> told reporters that restrictions demanded by the two campaigns were minor. He said the biggest was the decision not to show the audience of 2,000 people in the hall during the debate, except for fuzzy, `` over the shoulder'' shots. ` A lot of nonsense has been spoken and written about the shots,'' <PERSON> Fouhy </PERSON> said. `` That's simply wrong. You direct a television program so people watching at home have a good idea what's happening. <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, executive director of the bipartisan debate commission sponsoring the Quayle-Bentsen clash, said it's natural that both sides will fight hard for any advantage in a closely fought presidential race. ` I'm very pleased with all the arrangements,'' Ms. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` It's been a helpful exchange, a productive exchange, it's been a very honest exchange from all three parties.'' <PERSON> Fouhy </PERSON> noted that the first Bush-Dukakis debate on Sept. 25 was viewed by an estimated 35 million households. He said details of the staging are crucial because `` millions of people are going to watch this debate on television.'' The intense interest in this year's campaign has put the smallest details of the debates under scrutiny. Debate rules, for example, allow only a three-inch variation in the height of the candidates' lecterns. The final decision is made after each candidate makes his allotted one-hour visit to the hall, closed to reporters, a few hours before the debate begins. Little appearing on camera has been left to chance. Even the journalists on the debate panel _ <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Margolis </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Britt </PERSON> <PERSON> Hume </PERSON> _ drew lots to determine the order in which they asked questions. <PERSON> Fouhy </PERSON> said moderator <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodruff </PERSON> of public broadcasting's <ORGANIZATION> MacNeil </ORGANIZATION> @ Lehrer NewsHour will use gentle persuasion rather than cutting off the microphones of any candidate who talks beyond his time limit Though the main floor of the Civic Auditorium was turned into a large TV studio for the debate, the scene was much more informal one level below, where most of the 1,500 reporters covering the debate could watch on TV monitors.

 Moderator: <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Margolis </PERSON>, a question for <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. Q: Sen. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, I want to go back to the matter of qualifications, which I think for most people is more than just -- more than just your -- how long you've been in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> -- Quayle: <PERSON> Jon </PERSON>, we ca n't hear you. Q: You can hear now? I want to go back to the question of qualifications, which I think for most people is more than just how long you've been in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and how long you've been in public life. There's also a question of candor and of consistency. And several of the things you've said, both here and earlier, I think have raised some reasonable questions. Each of them alone might seem rather trivial, but I think together they create a pattern that needs to be asked. You've talked a few times today about the Job Training Partnership Act, which you authored In fact, I believe you co-authored it with another senator whom you almost never name. Earlier in the campaign, when you were asked why you got a very -- a desk job in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, after being trained as a welder -- you said, at the time, you had a very strong background in journalism, which at that time was summer jobs at your family-owned newspaper -LRB- about -RRB- which you have not been very forthcoming about what they were, as you have not been very forthcoming about your college record. Now, you'll have to say -- you have, at least the males on this panel have earlier agreed that your record was probably comparable to ours. But, nonetheless, these examples of sort of overstatement and exaggeration, and not being forthcoming, this is what has led a lot of people to question this part of your qualifications. Not your -- not your experience, but your character. Would you like to set some of these things straight now, as to what you did in your summer jobs in college, what your grades were like, and would you like to identify your co-sponsor of the Job Training Partnership Act. Quayle: All in two minutes? Q: Sure. Quayle: Let me -- let me start with the underlying premise that somehow I have n't been straight forward, and I have, and let's go -- right to the very first question: The Job Training Partnership Act. I was the author of that. The co-author in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> was Sen. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. I was the chairman of the employment and productivity subcommittee _ chairman of the committee _ write -LRB- sic -RRB- that legislation. Chairman of the committee write -LRB- sic -RRB- the legislation, and then they go out and get co-sponsorship. And when you are the chairman of the committee, and you sit down and you write the legislation, you are the author of that. And I'm proud to have been the author of that, because you know what we had, we had a CETA program, that spent $ 50 billion dollars -- from about 1973 through 1982. And when we concluded that program -- when we concluded that program, unemployment was higher than when it began. It was a program that did n't work, and the Job Training Partnership Act does work. Now, the issue of releasing all of my grades. I am, and I stand before you tonight, as the most investigated person ever to seek public office. Thousands of journalists have asked every professor I've had, all my teachers, and they know -- and I've never professed to be anything but an average student. I have never said that I was anything more than that, but it's not whether you're an average student, it's what are you going to do with your life? And what am I going to do with my life? I have committed it to public service since I was 29 years of age: Elected to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>, elected to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> when I was 33, and now ... Moderator: Senator? Sen. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>? <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>: I have absolutely no quarrel with Sen. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s military record, but I do strongly disagree with him on some of the issues You make great patriotic speeches, and I enjoy them. But I do n't understand your vote on veterans' issues. Sen. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has one of the worst voting records in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on veterans' issues. And one of them that particularly bothers me, sponsoring legislation to put a tax on combat pay and disability pay for veterans, for fighting men and women of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> _ tax on disability pay when lying there in the hospital, people who have sacrificed for our country. I think you ought to explain that to the people of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and you ought to explain it tonight. Moderator: <PERSON> Jon </PERSON>, a question for Sen. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. Q: Senator, you're chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and you're generally considered rather an orthodox conservative on fiscal matters, meaning someone who would be very concerned about the budget deficit. With everybody in politics afraid even to mention taxes or Social Security cuts or even very much restraint in defense spending, would you now list a few specific programs which would reduce or eliminate -- which you would reduce or eliminate to cut the deficit by about $ 50 billion, the deficit which is expected to be about $ 135 billion this fiscal year? <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>: One of them that I'd work on, and I do this as a farmer, I'd try to turn the situation around where we have seen the subsidy payments go from two and a half billion to ten times that under this administration. And the way I would accomplish that was with a tough trade policy -- opening up those markets, getting those prices back up to market prices. We can do that if we have an aggressive trade policy for our country, if we make trade a number one priority and not trade it off for some foreign policy objective of the moment. That means we have to stand up for the American farmers, and that cuts back on the regulation on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> farmers. That's a positive way to accomplish that. In addition to that, we'd do some of the things that I think have to be done insofar as doing a better job of procurement, particularly when we're talking about some of our military things that we should buy. I know that I've fought very hard to put in an independent inspector general for the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, but the senator from <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> opposed me on that. But we were finally able to put that into effect, and we saved over a quarter of a billion dollars this year -- almost enough to buy a squadron of F16s. Those are the kinds of things that I'd work on, and one of the things I learned in business is that you can expect what you inspect. So we'd be doing a much tougher job of auditing to try to get rid of some of these kickbacks to consultants on military contracts, to be much more aggressive on that. In addition, those types of things would bring the interest rate down. I'd try to turn this trade deficit around and that too would help us and help us very substantially. And I'd get rid of some things like these planes that you're going to have that the Administration wants that will fly from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and take those investment bankers over there in four hours I do n't think we can afford a piece of technological elegance like that. I'd strike that sort of thing from the ticket. I do n't know how many people have ridden the Concorde. Not many. But I voted against it -LRB- and -RRB- said it would be a financial disaster, and it's been just that. So those are the types of things that I would work on. Moderator: Sen. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. Quayle: The way we're going to reduce this budget deficit -- and it is a challenge to make sure that it is reduced -- is first to stick to the Gramm-Rudman targets. The Gramm-Rudman targets have worked. We've reduced the federal budget deficit $ 70 billion. Senator <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> voted against Gramm-Rudman -- the very tool that has been used to bring the federal budget deficit down. We're going to need all the tools possible to bring this federal budget deficit down. We need the tools of a line-item veto. A line-item veto that 43 Governors in this country have, but not the President of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> needs to have a line-item veto when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> goes ahead and puts into appropriations bills unrequested and unecessary spending. Let the president put a line through that, send it back to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and the let the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> vote on it again. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has got to help out in reducing this budget deficit as much as the executive branch.

 Moderator: <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON>, a last question for Senator <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. Q: Senator <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, I'd like to ask you about your split personality during this election year. You're running on a ticket with <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, a man who is opposed to the death penalty, a man who is in favor of gun control and at the same time, you're running for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in the state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> where your position on many of those same issues is well known and absolutely opposed to him How do you explain to the people of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> how you can be a social conservative on those cutting issues and still run with <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on the national ticket? <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>: <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was n't looking for clone. I think it's part of the strength and the character of this man that he reaches out and that he wants someone that will speak up, and that I'll do I've seen many chief executives come into my office and say, they're going over and tell the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> off, they're going to pound the desk, and go into that office and turn to jello. Now, I dealt with many a president, and I do n't hesitate for a minute to speak up. But when you're talking about something like the death penalty, where <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and I do disagree, what you really ought to get to is what's being done against crime and what kind of progress he's been able to make. In the state of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, he has the homicide rate down to the lowest of any industrial state. It's substantially ahead of the national average He's been able to do that with a educated program for the people of that state by adding some 15-hundred new police officers. He's done it in turn by the leadership that I think he will bring to the ticket when he becomes president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. And fighting drugs, he's taken it down some 4 percent in the high schools of that state while it's gone up around the rest of the nation But you would see him as president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> being very aggressive in this fight against crime and having that kind of a successful result. And that's one of the reasons I'm delighted and proud to be on the ticket with him. Sure we have some differences, but overall we have so many things we agree on. This situation of a trade policy, of cutting back on the deficit, those are positive, plus things and major issues facing our nation. Moderator: Senator <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>? Quayle: One of the things that they do n't agree on is in the area of national defense, national defense and how we're going to preserve the freedom in this country. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is the most liberal national Democrat to seek the office of presidency since <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON>. He is for, he is against the MX missile, the Midgetman, cutting two aircraft carriers. He is opposed to many defense programs that are necessary to defend this country. That's why former Secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> and former <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary in the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON> in an open letter to <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> asked Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, `` Are you viscerally anti-military?'' <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON> never got an answer and the reason he did n't is because the governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> does n't want to answer former Secretary <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON> on that very important question. Moderator: <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>, a last question for Senator <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. Q: Senator <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, all of us in our lifetime encounter an experience that help shapes our adult philosophy in some form or another. Could you describe for this audience tonight what experience you may have had and how it shaped your political philosophy? Quayle: There are a lot of experiences that I've had that have shaped my adult philosophy, but the one that I keep coming back to time and time again, and I talk about at commencement addresses, I talk about it in the high schools, I talk about it when I visit the job training centers, and it's the advice that my maternal grandmother <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Pulliam </PERSON>, who's 97 years old _ we are a modern-day four-generation family. The informa -, the advice that she gave me when I was growing up is advice that I've given my children and I've given to a number of children, a number of people, and it's very simple, it's very common sense And she says `` You can do anything you want to if you just set your mind to it an go to work.'' Now the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supporters sneer at that, because it's common sense. They sneer at common sense advice, Midwestern advice, Midwestern advice from a grandmother to a grandson, important advice, something that we ought to talk about, because if you want to, you can make a difference. You, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, can make a difference. You're going to have that choice come this election. Everyone can make a difference if they want to. Moderator: Senator <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>? <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>: I think being born and reared on the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION>, to have spent part of my life seeing some of the struggles that have taken place in one of the lowest per capita incomes in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and that's one of the reasons I've worked so hard to try to assist on education. And when I found that the bankers in that area found that they could not handle the loans because of some of the detail and the expense, could n't make a profit on it, I went down there and helped form a non-profit organization to buy up those loans from them and to manage them, and do it in a way where they'd continue to make those loans Now they have, and they've educated more than 20,000 of those students, loaned out over $ 100 million. And it has n't cost the taxpayers of this country one cent. It's one of the reasons I've worked so hard to bring better health care to the people, because what I've seen in the way of poverty down there in that area, and the lack of medical attention, and trying to see that that's turned around, why I worked so hard on the welfare reform bill, to give them a chance to break these cycles of poverty, the chance for a step up in life Moderator: Senator. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>: <PERSON> Judy </PERSON>, something's happened, but my light's still on.

 Moderator: Your lights are n't working? <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>: All right. Moderator: We're sorry about that, if that's the case. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>: Okay. Moderator: Thank you. Thank you, Senator <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. Thank you, Senator <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. We have now come to the end of the questions. And before I ask the candidates to make their closing remarks, on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Presidential Debates, I'd like to thank all of you for joining us. Senator <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, yours is the first closing statement. Quayle: Thank you. Tonight has been a very important evening. You have been able to see <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as I really am, and how <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and I want to lead this country into the future. Thank you, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, for listening, and thank you for your fairness. Now you will have a choice to make on election day. You will have a choice of whether <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is going to choose the road of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> or the road of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as we march toward the 21st century. The road of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> comes down to this: bigger government, higher taxes _ they've always believed in higher taxes, they always have and they always will _ cuts in national defense. Back to the old economics of high interest rates, high inflation and the old politics of high unemployment. Now, the road of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is the road to the future and it comes down to this: an <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> second to none, with visions of greatness, economic expansion, tough laws, tough judges, strong values, respect for the flag and our institutions. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will lead us to the 21st century, a century that will be of hope and peace. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> saved <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> from decline. We changed <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> fought us every step of the way. It's not that they're not sympathetic. It's simply that they will take <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> backwards. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has the experience, and with me, the future -- a future committed to our family, a future committed to the freedom. Thank you, good night and God bless you.

Our opposition says, `` Lower your sights, rest on your laurels.'' <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> think <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> can do better. But <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> ca n't just coast into the future, clinging to the past. This race is too close. The competition is too tough. And the stakes are too high. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> think <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> must move into that future united in a commitment to make this country of ours the most powerful, the most prosperous nation in the world. As Americans we honor our past, and we should. But our children are going to live in the future. And <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says the best of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is yet to come. But that wo n't happen -- taking care of our economy -- just putting it on automatic pilot. It wo n't happen by accident, it's going to take leadership and it's going to take courage, and the commitment and a contribution by all of us to do that. I've worked for the betterment of our country, both in war and peace, as a bomber pilot, as one who has been a businessman and a <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> senator, working to make this nation the fairest and the strongest and the most powerful in the world. Help us bring <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to a new era of greatness. The debate has been ours, but the decision is yours. God bless you. Moderator: Thank you both. Thank you.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on Wednesday accused <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of politically exploiting one `` tragic'' case involving a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> furlough program, said campaign momentum has shifted to him and promised `` five long, tough, aggressive weeks'' up to the election. The Democratic presidential nominee also praised the performance of his running mate, <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, in the vice presidential nominee's debate Wednesday night with Republican <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. `` The most important qualification for the vice president is that he's ready at a moment's notice to assume the presidency of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told a rowdy rally with supporters shortly after the debate. `` Tonight <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> demonstrated that he was the only one on that stage who's ready.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who spoke to <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> immediately after the debate, said the Democrat's performance should tell the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people `` about how I make presidential decisions and the way <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> makes presidential decisions.'' `` Tonight that was no contest,'' he said. Earlier, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> used the debate to joke about the beginning of the American League playoff series between the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletics </ORGANIZATION>. `` Our campaign is picking up steam,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told a news conference at the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Statehouse </LOCATION>, where he spent a day off the campaign trail catching up on gubernatorial duties. `` You can sense it. You can feel it. And I think it's because the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people want to move forward.'' Republican nominee <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has made his criticism of a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> furlough program a staple of his campaign and on Wednesday night aired a new television ad accusing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of running a `` revolving door'' prison system. At the center of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s attacks is a case in which an inmate on furlough raped a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> woman and assaulted her fiance <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who earlier this year signed legislation tightening eligibility requirements for the program, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was exploiting that case despite a comparable federal program. `` The vice president's record on crime and the fight against drugs is pathetic,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` It's been a failure and in my judgment this is an effort to use the one case with a tragic occurrence for political reasons. The vice president knows that the federal government has a very extensive furlough program, knows that Governor <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in the 70s had a very extensive furlough program and tragedies as a result of that.'' That answer came in response a question about suggestions by <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrats that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was trailing in that key state despite have a Texan running mate because he had not responded forcefully enough to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s attacks on crime, gun control and other issues. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> promised he would return the salvos soon, and aides said they would come as soon as Thursday, when <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> planned to visit <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. `` We have five, long, tough, aggressive weeks to go and believe me we'll be tough and aggressive in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and across this country and I think we're going to beat them in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also defended his new ads portraying <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as an issue-less candidate controlled by advisers. `` I wanted to express the very strong feeling that I have and that I think many have that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign is essentially a packaged candidacy and it's important for people to understand that,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. A new set of 30-second ads to be aired nationally starting Wednesday made a more direct attack on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his record on drug enforcement, education, the environment and Social Security. The four ads said the administration dealt secretly with <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, `` the Panamanian drug lord,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` personally'' weakened environmental regulations, `` personally'' cast the tie-breaking vote to cut Social Security'' and `` sat by while college loans for working families were cut.'' The governor also rejected assertions by a former Iranian official that the Democratic nominee had an emissary seeking to establish a line of communication with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and said he hoped the former official's assertion that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had an aide involved in hostage negotiations was untrue. `` I would hope that, and I believe, that these efforts to release the hostages have nothing to do with this campaign,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` These families and these hostages have been through too much pain and too much agony and too much tragedy as it is. ... Certainly nobody representing me or someone authorized by me is engaged in those kind of discussions.'' As for the debate, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> opened his news conference by saying it was a day `` that we've been waiting a long time for.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, seemingly discussing the debate, said he was `` a little nervous'' and that he had been told by aides to try to lower expectations. `` I'm rejecting the advice of my staff,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said as reporters leaned forward for his prediction. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION> are going to win.'' His prediction proved wrong. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION> lost 2-1. On a more serious note, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he expected <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> to `` do himself and the Democratic ticket proud.''

 For three decades, serious mishaps at the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> nuclear weapons plant were kept secret for national security reasons and in some cases not reported to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, according to federal officials who are trying to change that attitude.

An <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Callicott </PERSON>, said that since the federal government began making atomic weapons in World War II, `` there has always been a mind set, a culture, that we are doing work that is important for national security and perhaps that may override any obligation toward public accountablility.

 A simple urine test that detects bladder cancer at a treatable stage may be used to help diagnose prostate and some of the other cancers that afflict nearly a million Americans annually, researchers say. The test detects a protein associated with the spread of tumors, said Dr. <PERSON> Raouf </PERSON> <PERSON> Guirguis </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. The protein also has been found in patients with kidney cancer, prostate cancer and a nervous system cancer called neuroblastoma. `` It seems to be in all the cancers we have screened,'' <PERSON> Guirguis </PERSON> said. Existing tests to diagnose bladder cancer, involving removal of tissue, pose risk, are often painful and sometimes do not detect the cancer until it has spread and can no longer be cured, the cancer institute said. But <PERSON> Guirguis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Schiffman </PERSON> and colleagues, whose study is published in today's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said their test can identify bladder cancer at an early, treatable stage.

 Supporters of a bill to impose tougher restrictions on textile imports, after failing to override President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto, promise to renew their efforts when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> returns next year. `` We'll be back,'' Sen. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, said Tuesday after the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 272-152 to override <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto but fell 11 votes short of the two-thirds needed to enact the measure over his objections. The action appeared to close the book on the battle for textile legislation this year, with two weeks at most remaining before lawmakers adjourn to campaign full time. The bill, designed to protect <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> industry from foreign competition, would freeze current textile and apparel imports at 1987 levels and limit future increases to 1 percent annually. The same would apply to non-rubber footwear except that no future growth would be allowed.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> split by economic and regional differences has proven again that cleaning up air pollution from vehicle tailpipes and industrial smokestacks remains the nation's toughest environmental problem Only once since the Clean Air Act was enacted in 1970 has <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> been able to agree on major amendments to strengthen the basic law, and that occurred 11 years ago. Two years ago, environmentalists in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> renewed the campaign to escalate the battle against urban smog, acid rain caused by coal-burning factories and power plants and toxic fumes from chemicals. On Tuesday, they tossed in the towel, vowing to try again next year. `` There has not been sufficient willingness to compromise,'' said Sen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, who spent much of 1988 trying to put together a consensus on a clean air bill. `` As a result, we will do nothing.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, citing this summer's smog alerts around the country, said the technology exists to control air pollution. `` All we lack is the political will to do so.''

 Political parties are wrangling over a wiretapping scandal dubbed the `` Israeli Watergate'' but are speaking little of the Palestinian uprising as a critical election campaign enters its home stretch.

 Since 1981, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'' has led a charmed life, or a star-crossed one, depending on how you look at it. It's the eighth season for this odd-couple detective series. The show's been up, down and around. It was a flop its first time out, and CBS renewed it only at the eleventh hour. Then it became a hit, until it ran into `` The Cosby Show'' and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s Thursday night juggernaut. There was even a brouhaha a few years ago when <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> tried to move the show's locale from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, still smarting over the loss of `` <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON>,'' mounted a postcard campaign that caused CBS to back down. `` They've been beating on us for eight years,'' said <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> McRaney </PERSON>, who co-stars with <PERSON> Jameson </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> as brother detectives. `` They ca n't get us down for the count. I think the show has survived for the most part because we've got good scripts. And we do n't take ourselves too seriously. `` The relationship between the brothers and the notion of a family make it work. That would have worked in Elizabethan theater. Loyalty and integrity. People like to see those values reaffirmed.'' `` <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>,'' which returns Saturday, tells the story of two brothers who are unalike, yet supportive of each other. <PERSON> McRaney </PERSON> is <PERSON> Rick </PERSON>, rough, eccentric, laid back, who'd rather pluck his guitar and have fun. <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> is <PERSON> A.J. </PERSON>, conservative, a snappy dresser, whose ambition and hard work keeps their detective agency on track. `` A lot of detective shows steer clear of comedy,'' said <PERSON> McRaney </PERSON>. `` That makes us one of the few one-hour comedy shows on the air. We do a few serious episodes. But we have a sibling rivalry, and that's what makes it fun. `` From the beginning, <PERSON> Jameson </PERSON> and I participated in shaping the show. We were n't just hired help. The creator, <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> DeGuere </PERSON>, wanted us to be a part of it. I've directed five shows and written one. We read through the scripts every week and our suggestions are listened to seriously.'' The show was originally set in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and was called `` Pirate's Key. That was before `` Miami Vice,'' and neither <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> nor <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> was too keen on filming it in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. The locale was changed to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, although most of the show is filmed in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Carver </PERSON>, who plays mother to the pair, is still with the series. But other cast members have come and gone as the show has changed through the years. <PERSON> Jeannie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Barth </PERSON> from the original cast have left, as has <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, who was Detective Downtown <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> stars in `` <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s Place'' on CBS. This summer, <PERSON> McRaney </PERSON> worked on two TV movies. `` The People Across the Lake,'' a Gothic mystery co-starring <PERSON> Valerie </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>, was shown on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> this past Monday. He also took a small role in the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> movie `` Where the Hell's the Gold? so he could spend some time with his fiancee, <PERSON> Delta </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> of `` Designing Women.'' The Western comedy also stars <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Elam </PERSON>. `` We shot it in southern <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> McRaney </PERSON>, who has a second home in <LOCATION> Telluride </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION> `` We used a narrow-gauge railroad which runs through some beautiful country. My ambition is to rob the <ORGANIZATION> Durango </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Silverton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> from horseback. My partner and I want to take a dollar from the engineer.'' <PERSON> McRaney </PERSON> is also at work creating a new comedy series for himself for that day when `` <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Simon'' finally does come to an end.

<HEAD>For Indian Surgeon, the Impossible Dream Comes True</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In 1969, like thousands of other bright, young Indian professionals, <PERSON> Naresh </PERSON> <PERSON> Trehan </PERSON> went abroad to further his education. In less than two decades, he was one of the top heart surgeons in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> with an income of $ 1.5 million a year, an apartment on Fifth Avenue, a beach-front house on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and two cars in the garage. He wanted to come home, to bring his wife and two children back to their own country, but his professional achievements and aspirations had reached too high. During exploratory trips back to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, he found no place where he was willing to work. So he set out to fulfill a new dream: a world-class heart hospital in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, equipped with state-of-the-art computers and staffed with Indians who had set career goals their country could not accommodate. His Indian dream became a reality when the 170-bed Escorts <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> opened in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> in mid-September. `` It's like climbing a new mountain,'' the 42-year-old <PERSON> Trehan </PERSON> said. `` It's a passion for me to come back and train others.'' In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Trehan </PERSON> performed heart bypass operations and heart transplants. He was director of cardiovascular surgery at the <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, and he remains an assistant professor of surgery at <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Some years at least 10 percent of his patients were fellow Indians. <PERSON> Trehan </PERSON> reasoned that wealthy Indians who go abroad for heart surgery would pay comparable prices for the same quality of treatment at home _ while saving the cost of air fare and the hassle of travel. Their fees would help offset free or subsidized treatment for others. <PERSON> Trehan </PERSON> enlisted a wealthy industrial family to help bankroll the new hospital, whose start-up cost was budgeted at $ 20 million and, according to <PERSON> Trehan </PERSON>, will probably rise. News of the project spread by word of mouth among Indian doctors working in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` I was always thinking that we could do it here,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Sunil </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharma </PERSON>, who quit a job at <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, to become the Escorts center's chief bacteriologist and infection control officer. <PERSON> Sharma </PERSON>, 33, declined to disclose present salary but said it is about one-tenth of what he made in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The main attraction, he said, was the chance to live and work among his own people. `` The standard of living is so high abroad, but we are more emotionally attached to our patients here,'' <PERSON> Sharma </PERSON> said. `` In the States, everybody is afraid of malpractice -LRB- suits -RRB-, but here we treat from the core of our hearts.'' Of the 30 doctors now on staff at Escorts, 12 have returned from abroad. There were more mundane problems to deal with in establishing the new heart center. `` This hospital is going to be 100 percent fly-proof,'' <PERSON> Trehan </PERSON> declared as he strode across the polished-stone lobby to the front door where a powerful downdraft of air from the ceiling thwarts entry of flies and mosquitos. Flies seem to be a standard part of hospital life in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, along with families who camp in the courtyards and hallways, cook meals and try to keep track of a noisy assortment of half-naked children. At <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Narain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, one of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>'s largest, it is possible to walk in off the street and wander through corridors and wards without being questioned. People lie on the floors, and barefoot women in tattered saris flail the hallways with twig brooms that stir up dust without sweeping it away. At the Escorts center, security guards check visitors for passes. `` We are training our staff to a totally different level,'' <PERSON> Trehan </PERSON> said. `` And for the first time, we have introduced a housekeeping service similar to that in hotels.'' A formula was reached with the government under which 40 percent of all outpatients and 10 percent of all inpatients would be treated free of charge. About 25 percent of the rest would be given subsidized rates, while the rest would pay full costs. <PERSON> Trehan </PERSON>, as the center's executive director, will still perform surgery and plans to work for free if patients ca n't afford his bill. The other doctors had to agree to do the same. One of the hospital's first patients was <PERSON> Santosh </PERSON> <PERSON> Rani </PERSON> <PERSON> Arora </PERSON>, a 46-year-old widow. A bout with rheumatic fever 22 years ago left her with a severe aortic disease that causes her heart valves to leak. Surgery in 1970 and 1983 failed to solve the problem, according to her sons <PERSON> Sunil </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anil </PERSON>, both government civil servants. The sons expressed concern about being able to afford Escorts' charges, but <PERSON> Trehan </PERSON> told them they could pay $ 352 for an angiography test that normally would cost about $ 463 Later, when the family had left, <PERSON> Trehan </PERSON> said he expected to perform surgery on Mrs. <PERSON> Arora </PERSON>. `` I can forgo my fee,'' he said. `` I expect that we can help them out with the rest, and they can come up with whatever they can so we can recover the cost of some of the consumables -LRB- supplies and medicine -RRB-.''

<HEAD>Divisive Tax Reform Rekindles Scottish Nationalism</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCUS ELIASON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Scottish nationalists are counting on a widely unpopular reform of property taxes to lift them out of a decade-long spell in the cold. They talk of a Scottish-style <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and while the tax is not the trigger that will blast <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> out of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>, it is helping to stoke what the Scotsman newspaper calls `` a creeping resurgence of nationalism.'' The poll tax, as the sweeping reform is known, is central to Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s crusade against socialism and high-spending left-wing local governments in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. But to many Scots, it is a highhanded edict from a thoroughly English prime minister who, they believe, has no mandate north of the border. The Scottish <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which seeks outright independence for the 5.2 million Scots, is organizing a non-payment campaign. The tax also is a springboard for the more broadly based movement seeking devolution _ limited self-government under an elected Scottish parliament. <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>'s yen to end the 281-year-old union with <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> has always ebbed and flowed. In the mid-1970s it was powerful enough to force a referendum on devolution, but collapsed when the referendum failed to deliver a change. The Scottish <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> plummeted from 11 seats in the 650-member <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to just two. But last year it gained an extra seat, and made significant advances in the May local elections. And while it has never commanded a plurality of Scottish votes, polls consistently indicate that three-quarters of Scots favor self-government. The 1970s surge was prompted by a sense that <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> was n't getting enough revenue from its offshore oil boom Now it's the poll tax, or community charge as the government calls it, which takes effect in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> in April and will spread to the rest of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> a year later. Basically it shifts local taxation from property to people, requiring each local authority to calculate its expenses, and accordingly set a uniform sum to be paid by every resident over age 18. The government says it is fairer, simpler and makes local government more accountable, because municipalities will no longer be able to use funds collected from middle-class homeowners to finance generous social programs for those who pay little or no tax. While replacing the property tax, the poll tax, expected to average about 260 pounds -LRB- $ 340 -RRB- a year per adult, is in addition to the national income tax that Scots and all others in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> must pay. But the poll tax provides for 80-percent rebates for those with low incomes. The government estimates one-third of Scots will receive rebates, but a recent opinion poll reports 70-percent disapproval of the poll tax, with 52 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Scots </ORGANIZATION> believing they will be worse off and only 18 percent expecting to benefit. Judging by election results, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> does n't share Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s distaste for socialism. Her <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s share of the Scottish vote has fallen from 50 percent in 1955 to 24 percent in last year's general election, and the party holds only 10 Scottish seats in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, compared with the socialist opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s 50. Scottish <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> lawmaker <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Salmond </PERSON> calls non-payment `` the greatest moral and political challenge that the Tory government has yet faced in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>.'' But the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> risks being upstaged by the Nationalists, because it has voted not to espouse civil disobedience, fearing it would appear unfit for government. A dozen of <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s Scottish members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> are defying party policy, and one of them, <PERSON> Denis </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanavan </PERSON>, has already been fined 50 pounds -LRB- $ 85 -RRB- for refusing to register for the poll tax. `` It's not good enough for Labor to tell people to stop the tax through the ballot box,'' <PERSON> Kanavan </PERSON> said in an interview. `` We tried that and won last year in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, but we failed to stop it,'' But opinion polls indicate that only 24 percent of Scots are likely to refuse payment, and more than 90 percent have registered for the tax. The litmus test is likely to come sometime this autumn or next spring when <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Govan </PERSON> district holds a by-election to fill a vacant parliamentary seat. The polls favor victory for Labor, whose candidate, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON>, is one of the rebels refusing to pay the tax. But anything less than a crushing Labor victory will be seen as a boost for the <ORGANIZATION> Scottish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which is fielding <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sellars </PERSON>, a former Laborite. The Nationalists' Scotland-wide support has risen from 17 to 23 percent in recent polls, and they believe that once poll tax assessments start reaching Scottish households, that support will soar.

<HEAD>Campaign '88: Parties' Fat Cats Are Back and Spending Big</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Despite Watergate-inspired curbs on election spending, millions of dollars are pouring into <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> and Democratic campaign treasuries from fat cat contributors this fall, and it's all legal. Documents made available to reporters recently show that both political parties are avidly courting the kind of big-money donations that were tarnished by revelations of Watergate-era abuses and then supposedly curtailed by election law reforms of the 1970s. The biggest Republican contributor is <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Salgo </PERSON>, former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, who was listed as giving more than $ 500,000 to his party. The Democrats say a couple of unidentified unions are giving $ 200,000 each. Both parties are going after individuals willing to give $ 100,000 or more. The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> claims it has 115 such givers so far in the 1988 campaign. The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> counts 100 fat cats, with a goal of doubling the number. These funds are known as `` soft money'' because federal law prohibits unions and corporations from making direct contributions to federal election campaigns, and limits individuals to giving $ 1,000 in presidential primaries only. In the general election, the presidential nominees are forbidden to accept any private donations because each receives $ 46.1 million from a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> fund supported by the voluntary $ 1 checkoff on individual income tax returns, plus $ 8.3 million from his party. So millions of dollars in soft money are funneled through the parties to finance political activities at the state and local level, which are not subject to federal regulation. Even at that level, the parties have no trouble finding ways to use soft money for activities, such as voter registration and TV commercials, that clearly benefit their presidential candidates. `` What is happening in 1988 is, it's becoming clearer and clearer -LRB- that -RRB- soft money is making a joke of the campaign finance laws,'' said <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> For </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Responsive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Politics </ORGANIZATION>, a research organization that advocates tightening campaign finance laws. The list of soft money receipts released by the Democrats, which covers only June and July, included $ 4.8 million of about $ 15 million the party has raised in soft money so far. No public accounting of soft money is required, and the Democrats say they will make no further fund-raising disclosures until after the Nov. 8 elections. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Farmer </PERSON>, fund-raising chief for <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and head of the `` Victory Fund,'' says the party has a $ 50 million goal this year, with about $ 20 million coming from big-spending individuals. The GOP files showed $ 10 million in soft money raised through mid-September but did not include details of an additional $ 16 million raised by a `` Victory 88'' operation and slated for separate accounts in each state. Party officials say the Victory 88 goal is to raise $ 25 million in the states, while another soft money program, `` Team 100,'' will bring in about $ 15 million. Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the Republican nominee, frequently attends glittery fund-raising events in banquet halls or private homes to help bolster the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Victory'88'' effort. Farmer mines the telephone network of wealthy Democratic donors and concentrates on big-ticket galas featuring <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. While raising millions of dollars in soft money, the two major parties are stretching the rules to the limit. But they nonetheless are acting legally under guidelines which the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> is under court order to tighten up. Despite the federal ban on direct contributions to the candidates, party officials make support for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> a big part of their pitch to potential donors. `` We make it quite clear that they are not contributing to <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Sweitzer </PERSON>, finance director for the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is on the Democratic ticket and therefore he benefits indirectly from these funds. They're inspired by the head of the ticket to support the entire ticket.'' <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> developer <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Zappala </PERSON>, co-chairman of Republicans' Team 100 group of $ 100,000 donors, said that `` when you talk about <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, people are fairly receptive.'' <PERSON> Zappala </PERSON>'s tactic goes like this: `` You apprise people of the cost to run an election. It's expensive. We tell them we are running behind in fund raising. We do n't want to lose an election because we are running out of money.'' The Democrats, traditionally the fund-raising underdogs, say they have collected $ 38 million toward their $ 50 million goal this year. Of that sum, <PERSON> Sweitzer </PERSON> said, about $ 15 million is in soft money. Contrary to the ominous warnings in <PERSON> Zappala </PERSON>'s pitch, the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> boasts $ 67 million in overall receipts so far this year. Of that total, $ 13 million is soft money being raised in state accounts toward a goal of $ 25 million, plus nearly $ 10 million that has come from fat cat donors, pricey galas and the party's `` Eagle'' program of $ 10,000-per-year givers Both parties say it's not easy persuading individuals to give $ 100,000 or more, but there seem to be plenty of willing donors. `` People are surprised they can give that much,'' <PERSON> Zappala </PERSON> said. `` There's been a lot of concerns about the federal legal limits. We explain to them it is legal.''

 More than 200 contributors have forked over $ 100,000 or more to their favorite political party, as the Republicans and Democrats compete for fat cat donations that skirt federal election laws. The biggest <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> donor listed in documents recently released was <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Salgo </PERSON>, former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, who gave more than $ 500,000. McDonald's heiress <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kroc </PERSON> gave the Democrats $ 1 million, a contribution that is n't reflected in party records. The so-called `` soft money'' is being funneled into state-related political activities that ultimately will benefit <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Direct private contributions to the candidates' general campaigns are forbidden under federal law. The records show that on the corporate level, several companies spread their wealth to both political parties. Among them, <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> gave $ 50,000 to the Democrats and $ 75,000 to the Republicans. <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Richfield </LOCATION> gave $ 35,000 to the Democrats and $ 135,900 to the Republicans. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> gave the Republicans $ 36,350 and the <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, the industry's lobbying organization, gave $ 17,500 to the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>. Both gave the Democrats $ 850 each. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> gave the Democrats $ 31,375 and the Republicans $ 25,000. Dow Chemical gave the Democrats $ 5,850 and the Republicans $ 20,000. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> gave the Democrats $ 425 and the Republicans $ 11,000. The Republicans received $ 18,650 from <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION>, which figured in the Iran-Contra affair as the carrier used by former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s secret network to ferry arms and supplies to the Nicaraguan Contras. Not all members of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> `` Team 100'' group of $ 100,000 givers are reflected in the records because some may have given money through state accounts which are kept separately, said <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, finance director of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> narrowly has sustained President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto of a bill that would have tightened curbs on imports of textiles and apparel. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday fell 11 votes short of the two-thirds necessary to override the veto and turn the bill into law. Supporters said the measure would save jobs, but opponents said it would mean price increases amounting to a fresh tax on consumers. The bill would have frozen 1988 textile, non-rubber footwear and apparel imports at last year's level. It would have allowed a 1 percent annual increase in imports of footwear and apparel beginning in January.

 Automakers say they have completed their third-best sales year ever, with sales of 15.6 million cars and light trucks in the 1988 model year. Sales were up 0.7 percent from the 1987 model year, when 15.5 million were sold.

<HEAD>Oil Prices Steady, But Outlook Remains Bearish</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Analysts say the outlook for crude oil futures prices remains negative, despite recent stability. The November contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, rose 1 cent Tuesday to settle at $ 13.07 a barrel on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The contract skidded 86 cents over Friday and Monday to $ 13.06 a barrel, the lowest close for a near-term WTI contract since August 1986. Concerns about oversupply of crude have brought prices down by about $ 2 a barrel over the past five weeks. Those concerns were heightened Monday by <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s threat to step up its crude output unless other members of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> abide by their <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> production quotas. Oil prices opened higher Tuesday amid rumors that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> would move its ministerial meeting, scheduled for November, up to later this month, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Azarow </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. An early meeting raises speculation over the prospect of an agreement among <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members to rein in the cartel's production But the rally, which analysts said was based on technical factors, soon ran out of steam. The November crude contract went as high as $ 13.30 a barrel before slipping back. `` We're still in a bear market,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiedler </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> E.D. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Man </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` The market was expecting a rally of up to the $ 13.70 level and they have n't been able to get it.'' Besides <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> rumors, there was no news to affect trading, analysts said. `` The main thing goes back to the concerns about the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> overproduction,'' <PERSON> Fiedler </PERSON> said. Among refined products traded on the <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the November contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline fell 0.87 cent to 41.11 cents a gallon, while home heating oil rose 0.39 cent to 38.17 cents a gallon. <PERSON> Azarow </PERSON> said some of the movement in refined products was due to seasonal factors, such as a decline in driving that lowers demand for gas and the onset of cooler weather that increases heating oil use.

 <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has n't yet launched a formal hostile takeover of <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, but in sweetening its buyout proposal for the supermarket giant it has outlined plans to keep stepping up the buyout pressure. <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> late Tuesday offered to pay $ 64 a share in cash and securities for each of <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>'s 78.6 million outstanding shares, an indicated total of $ 5.03 billion, and repeated its request to meet with the <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> board. The amount of the latest proposal topped not only the buyout firm's previous offer of $ 58.50 a share, or about $ 4.6 billion, but also the proposed $ 4.6 billion restructuring plan that <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors approved last month to thwart any outside takeover Furthermore, <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> indicated that if <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> decided to go through with the restructuring, the firm was willing to buy the surviving company _ and it hinted <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> also might be willing to take its offer directly to <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> shareholders. `` We have come forth with what we believe is an exceptional offer for your company's shareholders and we are confident that, if given the opportunity, your shareholders would embrace it,'' <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> said in a letter to the board of Cincinnati-based <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> announced its sweetened offer after the close of stock trading Tuesday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> shares dipped 87 -LCB- cents to $ 55.37 -LCB- a share in heavy trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>'s management, legal and financial advisers are reviewing the second unsolicited proposal from <ORGANIZATION> KKR </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernish </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>, said late Tuesday. He said the company had no further comment. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> has been resisting overtures from <LOCATION> Kohlberg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kravis </LOCATION> and the <PERSON> Haft </PERSON> family of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, which had offered $ 4.32 billion, or $ 55 a share, for <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> specializes in leveraged buyouts _ purchases made with mostly borrowed money that is repaid with funds from the target company's operations or the sale of its assets. The firm rarely has engaged in an outright hostile takeover, partly because the success of its deals often depends on having existing management remain with the target company. But as its coffers have bulged with money from investors anxious to participate in buyouts _ <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> has an estimated $ 5.6 billion warchest that can be used as equity to leverage about seven times that amount _ pressure has mounted for the firm to be more aggressive in creating deals. <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION>' sweetened offer includes $ 50 in cash, $ 11 in debt securities and $ 3 in stock of the new company that <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> would create from <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>. The investment firm's earlier offer contained the same cash portion of $ 50 but only $ 8.50 in securities. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>'s restructuring announced Sept. 13 would pay stockholders a special dividend of $ 40 a share in cash, securities valued at $ 8 plus stock in the surviving company, valued at $ 5 to $ 10 a share. <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> said that if <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> undertook the plan, <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> would be willing to acquire the stock in the restructured company for $ 13.50 a share _ $ 10 in cash and $ 3.50 a share in debentures. As such, <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> stockholders would realize a total of $ 61.50 a share in cash and securities from both parties. The investment firm noted the alternative, post-retructuring buyout would be for $ 2.50 a share less than its up-front offer, and said the difference reflected its estimates of financing fees <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> would have to pay under the restructuring plan, plus <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION>'s added costs in financing <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> debt incurred in the restructuring. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>'s restructuring also includes layoffs and the sale of operations, in order to streamline the company and cut costs. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> operates more than 1,300 supermarkets, 935 convenience stores and 15 membership warehouses in 29 states. The company also processes food products for sale in its stores and to outside customers.

Grand Metropolitan said in a filing with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> that if its $ 60-a-share bid begun Tuesday succeeds, it would sell <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Steak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ale and <ORGANIZATION> Bennigan </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> restaurant operations The under-performing full-service restaurant division was restructured in January, resulting in a $ 91 million charge that has dragged down earnings. The restructuring also precipitated management changes, including the hiring of former <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> as its own new chairman in July. Grand Metropolitan indicated it would sell <ORGANIZATION> Steak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ale and <PERSON> Bennigan </PERSON>'s because of state laws prohibiting a company from owning both alcoholic beverage makers and retailers. <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> is using that issue to challenge the takeover bid, although by Tuesday it had not actually or approved of the offer. In a statement issued late Tuesday, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> had sued to block the acquisition in 13 states, contending a buyout by Grand Met would violate liquor laws prohibiting producers from owning liquor retailers. Courts in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> have issued temporary restraining orders enjoining Grand Met from acquiring any <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> stock, and a <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> court has rejected Grand Met's effort to stop those actions, <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> said. Grand Met, a $ 10 billion a year diversified company, is one of the world's biggest wine and spirit makers, with brands that include <ORGANIZATION> Smirnoff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vodka </ORGANIZATION>, J & amp; B Scotch, <PERSON> Gilbey </PERSON>'s Gin, <PERSON> Watney </PERSON> and Ushers ale and Almaden wines. In a separate statement, <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> said that its board would review the offer `` at an appropriate time.'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said at the company's annual shareholders' meeting in September that one of his chief goals was keeping the company independent. But on Tuesday, industry analysts doubted <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> could defend itself against the takeover bid and remain independent. <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> stock soared by $ 18.50 a share to $ 57.50 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday, the first trading session after Grand Met made its offer. `` It's going to be a bid that <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> management is going to have difficulty defending against,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> McMillen </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` I think they'll fight it initially _ attempt to fight it _ but I think it's a losing battle. <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, Grand Metropolitan's chief executive for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> operations, said Tuesday in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> that he is `` very interested in doing this thing in a gentlemanly manner.'' <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s struggling restaurant division, which includes the Burger King fast-food chain, provides about half <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 6.2 billion in annual revenue. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said Grand Metropolitan would keep Burger King but would sell <PERSON> Distron </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s in-house distribution system for Burger King. London-based Grand Metropolitan also owns hotels, the Alpo pet food company, <ORGANIZATION> Pearle </ORGANIZATION> vision centers, and a chain of betting offices in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. Analysts speculated Grand Metropolitan was most interested in <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> for its <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Giant </ORGANIZATION> vegetable, Haagen-Dazs ice cream and <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON>'s frozen fish operations. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said there were good prospects for marketing <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s food products overseas, especially its microwavable foods Further, Grand Metropolitan proposed in a letter to <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> that <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> become the headquarters of a Grand Met international foods group. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, who met with a number of state officials while waiting for a response from <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>, said Grand Metropolitan decided to move aggressively with a tender offer because <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> officials had indicated that `` if anyone came near the drawbridge, they would have a real cat-and-dog fight.'' Grand Metropolitan filed suit on Monday in <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to invalidate <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s `` poison pill'' takeover defense, which would make a hostile merger prohibitively expensive. <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> is incorporated in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> also might seek protection from <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> lawmakers, who met in special session last year to pass legislation protecting Minneapolis-based <ORGANIZATION> Dayton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hudson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> from a possible hostile takeover bid by the <PERSON> Haft </PERSON> family.

 <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, a subsidiary of Dallas-based <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, plans to sell its Ohio-based steel bar division as part of the parent company's reorganization under federal bankruptcy laws. `` The company had indicated several months ago that it did not intend to reorganize with what it considered marginally profitable operations,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Coyle </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> 27. <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has hired <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to help find a qualified buyer for the division. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> also recently helped <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> find a buyer _ <ORGANIZATION> Warren </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> _ for its <ORGANIZATION> Warren </ORGANIZATION> mill and its Republic Drainage Products plant in <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION>'s bar division employs about 5,400 salaried or hourly workers, and the union represents about 4,200, with 3,200 at <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> operations in <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Massillon </LOCATION>. Company representatives met Tuesday in <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> with public and union officials. `` There's always uncertainty and some apprehension. The company assured us it's their intention to sell to a purchaser with a commitment to keep it profitable and more profitable in the future,'' <PERSON> Coyle </PERSON> said. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> executive vice president, said at a news conference following the meeting there was no deadline set for a sale. `` The process will necessarily take a considerable period of time,'' <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said. `` Precisely what that will be is impossible for us to forecast, but it is nothing that is going to happen tonight, next week or even next month.'' Separate management, marketing, sales, customer service, engineering and research operations already exist in the bar division, <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoag </PERSON> said in a statement. `` The bar division is well positioned and prepared to operate apart from <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Hoag </PERSON> said.

 <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> says it will offer buyouts to as many as 140 engineers and technicians in an effort to trim at least 40 employees from its work force. <PERSON> Dom </PERSON> <PERSON> Giofre </PERSON>, a spokesman for the television network, said the buyout offer was prompted by the recent sale of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s radio operation and by the winding down of 1988 political coverage. `` I do n't think this really comes as a real surprise to anyone,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherlock </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> President of Operations and Technical Services. He said only employees in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> are involved. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> has has dramatically reduced its payroll since it was acquired by <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> two years ago. About 400 people in the news division have lost their jobs and another 110 are scheduled to go before the end of the year. The engineers and technicians were scheduled to be notified beginning today in a series of meetings with supervisors. `` If all 140 people accept, they will pay it, although they are aiming to cut only 40 positions,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> McElroy </PERSON>, a spokesman for Local 11 of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> and Technicians. Workers will have until Nov. 10 to accept the voluntary offer. Those who accept will continue to receive regular paychecks as well as health and other benefits through the end of the year. The balance of the severance would be paid in a lump sum on Jan. 2, <PERSON> Sherlock </PERSON> said. Currently, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> employs about 1,000 technicians, down by 300 since a 118-day strike in 1987.

 <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s growing love affair with light trucks towed the auto industry to its third-best year on record, as car makers reported selling 15.6 million vehicles in the 1988 model year. The 0.7 percent increase over the 15.5 million vehicles sold during the 1987 model year was fattened by strong sales of U.S.-made light trucks, including pickups, minivans and sports utility vehicles. The overall increase came despite a slight dip in sales of cars, the automakers reported Tuesday. Foreign and domestic car makers reported car sales slipped 1.4 percent to about 10.4 million cars in the model year ended last Friday from about 10.5 million cars sold during the year before. But sales of light trucks rose 4.2 percent to 5.1 million in 1988, from 4.9 million in the 1987 model year. Leading the way were U.S.-made trucks, rising to 4.4 million vehicles this year, compared just less than 4 million last year, an 11.2 percent increase. Sales of light trucks made outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> tumbled 24.9 percent to 724,584 vehicles in the 1988 model year from 961,465 in the year before. `` There has been a lot of competition for trucks on the domestic and foreign side,'' said <PERSON> Jeannette </PERSON> <PERSON> Garretty </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` That has ... given the appearance and the actuality that you can swing a good deal in that market.'' But overall car sales have drooped. Industry leader <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> was the only loser among the Big Three in the 1988 model year, with sales of about 3.6 million U.S.-made cars between Oct. 1, 1987 and Sept. 30, 1988, down 4.9 percent from the 3,719,267 domestically made cars it sold the year before. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s sales rose 2.9 percent to 2.14 million cars in 1988 from 2.07 million in 1987. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> sales rose 3 percent to about 1.05 million cars in 1988 from 1.01 million during the year before. Overall sales made it a stronger-than-expected model year, which analysts had anticipated would see sales of about 15 million vehicles or less. `` I think it's particularly surprising in light of what the initial expectations were post-Oct. 19 of last year'' when the stock market crashed, said analyst <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Laughlin </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> `` I was looking more for 14 million in that period. I had to consistently raise it through the period,'' he said. The model year ended on a downturn for the automakers as September sales of imported cars and trucks fell to 268,362 vehicles, down 16.6 percent from the 321,656 vehicles sold during the same month last year. Sales of U.S.-made cars and trucks dipped 2.2 percent in September, to 895,861 vehicles from 916,410 vehicles during September 1987. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> showed the largest car sales decline in the Sept. 21-30 period, dropping 15 percent to 116,028 cars this year from 136,483 during the same period last year. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s late September sales fell to 70,813 cars, down 14.3 percent from 82,606 during the period last year. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s late-September sales dropped 4.5 percent to 33,314 cars this year from 34,898 last year.

Under terms of a plan submitted in bankruptcy court five weeks ago, a <ORGANIZATION> Horsham </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary would acquire <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> and other Apex properties, including a <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> ski resort, for cash and the assumption of debt at a discount. Among <ORGANIZATION> Horsham </ORGANIZATION>'s partners in the deal is <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Zell </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> investor whose burgeoning business empire includes <ORGANIZATION> Itel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Zell </PERSON> said recently that he and <ORGANIZATION> Horsham </ORGANIZATION> want <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> because they believe the refining and marketing business will be a steady money-maker during a period of anticipated low oil prices Under the timetable set by the bankruptcy court, the rival bids will be reviewed next week. A full hearing on the purchase will be held Oct. 31, when the judge could approve one of the proposals.

 A new $ 50 million agreement between <ORGANIZATION> Scandinavian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is designed to strengthen the competitive positions of both companies, officials say. Separately, a report published today said <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> is holding discussions to sell its <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> air shuttle to developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>. According to unidentified sources quoted by The Wall Street Journal, the pricetag on the three-city shuttle is in the $ 200 million range. As evidence the shuttle is up for sale, Journal sources noted that planes and lounge areas have been refurbished, and attendants are getting new uniforms. The service is run by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> declined comment on the Journal report, said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a spokesman for the airline company. Representatives of Trump were n't immediately available for comment. Some say <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> might use the shuttle, which operates between <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, to help draw people to his hotel and casino properties in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> already operates a helicopter service between <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Under <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>'s agreement with <ORGANIZATION> SAS </ORGANIZATION>, the Scandinavian airline will lease airport gates in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> area and have the right to buy up to 10 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>'s stock on the open market. The accord, signed Tuesday, also includes provisions for coordinating marketing, reservations and scheduling, and the companies will establish a joint training program for airline workers. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airline company, owns <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, which have been hurt by financial losses, labor problems and complaints about service. <ORGANIZATION> SAS </ORGANIZATION>, renowned for service but weak in scheduling connections to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, has been seeking ways of positioning itself to exploit the era of European deregulation that will begin in 1992. `` Our aim is to maximize efficiency and provide the best professional service to business travelers anywhere in the world,'' <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> told reporters at a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> press briefing. Under the agreement, <ORGANIZATION> SAS </ORGANIZATION> will pay <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> $ 15 million to lease three gates at <ORGANIZATION> Newark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, beginning next spring. <ORGANIZATION> SAS </ORGANIZATION> will pay Eastern $ 10 million for a similar lease arrangement at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> John </LOCATION> <LOCATION> F. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in 1991. <ORGANIZATION> SAS </ORGANIZATION> also will pay <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> $ 25 million. <ORGANIZATION> SAS </ORGANIZATION> will have the right to buy up to 10 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>'s stock on the open market, and <ORGANIZATION> SAS </ORGANIZATION> officials said they intended to make the purchases within six months <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> stock was the most actively traded issue Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, declining 12 -LCB- cents to $ 14.25. The company has 39.9 million shares outstanding. <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlzon </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> SAS </ORGANIZATION> president and chief executive officer, will become a member of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors. The marriage of a financially pressed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airline company and a service-oriented European carrier makes sense for both, analysts said. <ORGANIZATION> SAS </ORGANIZATION> will get the access to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> routes that it is seeking while <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> will get cash that it needs, noted <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Argus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The agreement is not unprecedented, but it combines elements of existing arrangements in a new way. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, the biggest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carrier, signed an agreement with <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> late last year setting up a worldwide marketing partnership. But unlike the accord between <ORGANIZATION> SAS </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> United-British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> combination does n't include an equity stake. <ORGANIZATION> SAS </ORGANIZATION>' equity stake in <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> `` helps them cement the alliance,'' <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said. As European deregulation approaches, similar accords between major airlines in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> are likely to crop up, said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Geller </PERSON>, an airline analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Provident </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. In another case, <ORGANIZATION> Ansett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, an Australian conglomerate owned 50-50 by media tycoon <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> and transportation company <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, has a 20 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Tempe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz </LOCATION>. The two do not have a cooperative agreement. Officials of <ORGANIZATION> SAS </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> said they began discussions for such an alliance about nine months ago, at <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s initiative. <ORGANIZATION> SAS </ORGANIZATION> has similar arrangements with Thai International Airways of <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, and recently purchased a stake in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s national carrier. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> currently has services from <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, and from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> SAS </ORGANIZATION>, heavily used by business travelers, flies between <LOCATION> Scandinavia </LOCATION> and four <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities: <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. The Scandinavian flag carrier, 50 percent owned by the governments of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, has tried to develop what its management calls a `` global axis'' strategy to provide travelers with the most convenient connections through a network of cooperation pacts with other carriers.

 Acid rain is more widespread than earlier believed, with more than half of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s lakes and rivers contaminated, according to a report to an international conference which ended Wednesday. The report to the U.N.-sponsored Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution said the extent of the damage could be much worse, since the research was mainly based on information provided by the countries concerned. `` In some cases, it is too late to do anything,'' said <PERSON> Kaarle </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenttamies </PERSON>, head of the Finnish <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> team which conducted the survey commissioned by the <ORGANIZATION> Nordic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION>. `` In other countries, particularly the peripheral regions such as <LOCATION> Scandinavia </LOCATION> and southernmost <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, there is still hope,'' <PERSON> Kenttamies </PERSON> said. `` But many small lakes and rivers, especially in central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, are dead and only a 100 percent drop in sulphur emissions can save them,'' he said. Dumping a heavy dose of lime also helps reduce acidity, he said. The year-long research showed nearly all smaller bodies of water in central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> can no longer be used as sources of drinking water, <PERSON> Kenttamies </PERSON> said. The conference, which drew participants from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and nine west European nations, urged the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> for <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to adopt stricter measures to fight pollution caused by nitrogen and sulphur emissions. ECE-member countries have decided to start a joint transboundary pollution monitoring project in 1989 to study environmental changes caused by acid rain. The research is aimed at an in-depth study and classification of data as well as creating an integrated monitoring system on acidification across <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` Despite certain opposition to such research, particularly in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, we can safely say that acidification is one of the worst pollution problems of the 1980s,'' <PERSON> Kenttamies </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kenttamies </PERSON> rejected as `` nonsense'' the argument that no conclusive evidence exists that fossil fuel-fired power stations are a main contributor to acid rain. `` Whatever people say, I've seen enough reports and been to enough conventions like the one here today to know that we have such conclusive evidence,'' he said. The high cost of fighting acid rain is a problem for countries which rely heavily on fossil fuels. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, both heavy coal users, are the only European nations which refused to join the `` Thirty Percent Club'' whose aim is to reduce 1980-level sulphur emissions 30 percent by 1993. Acid rain in <LOCATION> Scandinavia </LOCATION>, mostly from industrial centers in eastern and western europe, also has contaminated lakes and forests. Finns were recently shocked to learn of heavy pollution in what had been considered virgin <LOCATION> Lapland </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> caused by massive Soviet copper and nickel works from industries in the <LOCATION> Kola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, according to reports. A joint commission, currently meeting in <LOCATION> Yalta </LOCATION>, was set up by the Finns and the <LOCATION> Russians </LOCATION> to study cross-border pollution, which is threatening the livelihood of northern Finns dependent on reindeer husbandry.

 An aide to <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s high-yield bond financier <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> recently was compelled to testify before a federal grand jury investigating the securities firm, the aide's lawyer said Wednesday <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Dahl </PERSON> was forced to appear before the grand jury in the last few weeks under a compulsion order obtained by the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office, <PERSON> Dahl </PERSON>'s lawyer <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Fishbein </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The Wall Street Journal characterized <PERSON> Dahl </PERSON>'s appearance as a breakthrough for the government in its extensive probe into the business affairs of <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, who are fighting <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> charges of securities fraud and could face possible criminal indictments soon. But it was unclear from the Journal account how <PERSON> Dahl </PERSON>'s appearance represented a breakthrough The content of his remarks to the grand jury were not disclosed. `` <PERSON> Dahl </PERSON> is not a cooperating witness,'' <PERSON> Fishbein </PERSON> said. `` He was compelled to do that by a court order. If he did n't testify he would have been put in jail.'' <PERSON> Fishbein </PERSON> said the order contained a provision for immunity from prosecution, which is specified in the federal law for obtaining such orders. The attorney declined to comment on what <PERSON> Dahl </PERSON> may have told the grand jury. Officials at the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office did not immediately return telephone calls for comment. Their policy, however, is to refrain from commenting on grand jury matters. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Anreder </PERSON> said the firm does n't comment on grand jury proceedings. But he said <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s lawyers had advised the firm that grants of limited immunity were not unusual in such investigations. <PERSON> Dahl </PERSON>, who is still employed by the firm, works in <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s West Coast-based high-yield bond department, headed by <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>. The Journal said <PERSON> Dahl </PERSON> was the first <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> official to break ranks and cooperate with the government's inquiry since the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> filed its civil charges against the firm and <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> Sept. 7, accusing them of insider trading, stock manipulation, defrauding clients and other violations. Those charges, denied by the defendants, stem largely from claims by now-imprisoned speculator <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, who turned state's evidence after paying a record $ 100 million fine to the government two years ago for insider trading. Federal investigators have been working to substantiate <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s assertions with other evidence but there are indications they have been frustrated in obtaining supporting testimony from others. Lawyers for <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, meantime, have been fighting aggressively to obtain whatever evidence the government has to prepare their defense. They also have challenged the objectivity of the federal judge assigned to the case, <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON>, on grounds his wife has an interest in a Drexel-financed deal. In a related matter, another federal judge ruled the government has the right to freeze funds of innocent partners in an unindicted investment partnership, when other partners are accused in a racketeering case. The Tuesday decision by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> is significant because the case involving <ORGANIZATION> Princeton-Newport </ORGANIZATION> partners, a small partnership based in <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, represents the first time the government has brought racketeering charges against securities professionals. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s ruling apparently gives the government broad authority to tie up a firm's legitimate businesses, even when it is n't accused of a crime The implication is enormous for <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> if any of its employees are similarly accused of racketeering by a grand jury.

<HEAD>Choices Proliferate in CDs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Now that such former best sellers as stocks and mutual funds have fallen out of favor, financial institutions are busy these days pushing a hot new idea _ certificates of deposit. Not just plain vanilla CDs, mind you, though you can certainly still get those stodgy old-timers if you want them. What we're dealing with now are rising-rate CDs, floating-rate CDs, CDs with no set maturity dates, even CDs that effectively let you make a legal bet on your favorite sports team or the outcome of the November election. All this has n't happened just by chance. The stock market crash last fall and the wide swings in interest rates over the past several years have brought big changes in the marketplace where brokers and bankers sell their merchandise. `` I choose to think of it as a rebirth of investor prudence,'' says <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, a Valley Forge, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, adviser on tax and investment planning.'' `` Today's low tax rates and market turmoil have reinstated preservation of principal as a justifiable objective for personal planning.'' In this environment, CDs are a natural choice for financial marketers to seize upon. Thanks to today's high level of real interest rates -LRB- as compared with the inflation rate -RRB-, they can offer a reasonable return, with the backing of federal deposit insurance. And thanks to financial deregulation, the once-rigid format of a certificate of deposit has become very flexible. In general, financial advisers say, that is a plus for savers and investors. But they caution that it takes a lot of care to distinguish the substance from the sizzle in the new generation of CDs. There is no real harm, for instance, in buying a CD whose yield will vary depending on the outcome of the Super Bowl or the election, as long as you have enough financial leeway to play that kind of game with your money. A little no-nonsense calculation may cool your enthusiasm for such a deal, which do n't really offer much of a payout or loss. With one `` presidential'' CD now on the market, the newsletter 100 Highest Yield calculates, if the candidate of your choice wins with 59 percent of the popular vote -LRB- the amount President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> got in his 1984 landslide -RRB-, you would receive an extra $ 10.13 over the next four years on a $ 1,000 deposit. If you opt to shop purely for yield and safety, the choices are still bewilderingly large. Newsletters like 100 Highest Yields, in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, and Income & amp; Safety, in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, compile lists of top-yielding CD offerings by banks and savings institutions around the country. Even with federal deposit insurance, it makes sense these days to check out the status and prospects of some faraway institution before you mail off a large deposit check. Alternatively, you can do your CD shopping at brokerage firms, which may have certificates from a wide variety of insured institutions to offer. `` Brokerage houses not only seek out the highest-paying institutions to provide CDs for their customers, but they also frequently negotiate special package deals that lead to higher rates than the same banks offer directly to the public,'' says the Income & amp; Safety newsletter. It may be possible to liquidate a CD investment bought from a broker before maturity without paying a penalty, since most brokers endeavor to maintain a continuous `` secondary'' market in the CDs they sell. You probably wo n't have to pay a commission when you buy or sell. But if you are thinking of selling before maturity, check into the `` spread'' _ the difference between the broker's bid and asked prices. Just possibly, the spread might be as large as or larger than the early withdrawal penalty.

<HEAD>SmithKline Sweetens Severance Package For Workers Facing Layoff</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Workers who promise not to sue <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beckman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> over their layoffs will receive a sweetened severance package, The <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inquirer </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday. In a three-page letter last week to about 3,000 workers in the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> area, <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> said those who sign a waiver will receive more severance pay, career counseling and extended health benefits. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wendt </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer, said in the letter a `` similar package for voluntary resignation in designated areas will be announced later this year.'' Workers who do n't sign the waiver will be eligible for the standard severance package, and some longtime workers will be eligible for an enhanced pension whether they sign a waiver or not. <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> announced last week it would eliminate 1,600 jobs, mostly in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, as part of a $ 400 million restructuring that will include the public sale of 17 percent of its <ORGANIZATION> Beckman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION> division. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaeffer </PERSON>, vice president for research for <ORGANIZATION> Hay-Huggins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> benefits-consulting firm, said companies commonly ask employees to sign a waiver in return for enhanced separation benefits The company said employees who earn a weekly paycheck _ including most production workers and secretaries _ would receive two to three times as much as they would under the standard plan, if they sign the waiver. For example, a 17-year employee earning a weekly paycheck would normally get 18 weeks of severance pay. Under the enhanced plan, that worker would receive nearly 56 weeks of pay. Workers paid twice a month _ including managers and supervisors _ would get 25 percent more than the normal severance. For example, a 10-year veteran's severance pay would last six months and a week instead of the standard five months. The career counseling will be available to all who sign the waiver. Normally such transition assistance is only offered to upper-level employees, a company spokesman said. <ORGANIZATION> SmithKline </ORGANIZATION> will continue to pay its share of health benefits for six months after termination instead of three months. A company spokesman said employees would be encouraged to review the severance package for at least 10 days before deciding whether to sign the waiver.

<TEXT>
 Federal regulators estimated today it will cost between $ 45 billion and $ 50 billion to clean up the ailing savings and loan industry, increasing earlier projections by more than a third. <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which regulates the nation's 3,000 <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls, told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> this summer the cost would be $ 31 billion. Today he revised his figure upward to bring it more in line with other government estimates, including the $ 45 billion to $ 50 billion projection of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' General Accounting Office. But the figure is still far short of private estimates ranging from $ 75 billion to $ 100 billion. Noting that the bank board has resolved 122 cases so far this year at a cost of $ 20 billion, <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> said it would cost an additional $ 24.9 billion to $ 29.9 billion for the work that remains to be done. Wall said that cost could be covered by the current resources of his agency, but only if a special assessment on healthy thrift institutions is extended over the next 30 years. S & amp; Ls currently pay 21 cents a year in regular and special assessments to the bank board to insure every $ 100 in deposits, nearly double the 8 cent per $ 100 regular assessment paid by commercial banks. The special assessment for thrifts had been scheduled to be phased out. When Wall suggested earlier this summer that the assessment would have to continue over 10 years, he unleashed a flood of protests from industry lobby groups. The bank board's new estimate comes at a time of rising debate over whether taxpayers will be required to rescue the thrift industry. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, D-Wis., said last month that taxpayers likely will have to contribute $ 20 billion to fixing the problem However, <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, who spoke with reporters in advance of testimony scheduled today before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said some institutions would not survive under a continuing special assessment. But he added: `` I do n't think we're to a taxpayer bailout yet.'' The updated estimate reflects industry losses during the April-June period of this year, and the bank board's cost of resolving cases through September, which have been greater than originally anticipated, <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said. Money-losing institutions posted red ink of $ 5.1 billion in the second quarter. That was only partly offset by $ 1.5 billion in profits made by 71 percent of the industry. <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said it is difficult to calculate the effect of the higher costs of the federal budget deficit because only certain kinds of government assistance count toward the deficit. However, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>, estimates that the budget deficit will be inflated by nearly $ 15 billion a year over the next three years under a cost estimate of $ 50 billion. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> today is considering legislation sponsored by Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> LaFalce </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, to expand the bank board's authority to borrow money by selling bonds from the $ 10.8 billion authorized last summer to $ 15 billion. <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said he opposes the legislation because it places emphasis on the bond sales, which are not obligations of the federal government and are thus more expensive than the bank board's preferred method of issuing promissory notes to shore up troubled institutions

 Asked in a survey to name five companies they associate with quality products, 1,005 Americans most often named <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>. Nothing really surprising in that, or in the second five _ <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>, RCA -LRB- a GE subsidiary -RRB- and <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> _ because they would n't be so big unless they were doing something right. What is surprising is that the characteristic most often cited in determining product quality is how well the name is known, outranking such considerations as workmanship, price, performance, durability and style. The response to a Gallup survey for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quality </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> suggests how difficult it is to evaluate the mind of the American consumer in dealing with manufactured products. But if it is difficult to measure attitudes toward the most tangible of products, it is even more so in dealing with services, which are produced in even greater abundance in the American economy. How, for example, do you measure the quality of an insurance policy when you do not even understand its contents? You know when an automobile runs well; you might never know how well your policy performs until you have an accident. Cost comparisons are more difficult too. Some life insurance policies actually provide better coverage and higher cash value at a lower price than others. But only geniuses or actuaries are likely to know the difference. As a result, the perception of service quality is more likely to be on the basis of interaction with specific individuals, such as insurance agents. Price for example, ranked sixth as a service quality determinant in the Gallup poll, behind `` courteous, polite treatment,'' the satisfaction of needs, past experience, recommendations and promptness. High on the list were such determinants as attitude and helpfulness of personnel, friendliness and personal atttention. Far down the list was `` company name,'' a factor that seemed to play a large role in rating product quality. Unlike the product quality survey, Gallup did n't rate individual companies in a survey on service. Instead, it limited responses to perceptions of quality in segments of the service industry, with these results: On a scale of 1 to 10, or worst to highest, banks received the highest evaluation, with a 54 percent majority ranking their service at 8 or better. It was the only one to exceed 50 percent. Ranked second were hotels, at 44 percent, followed by hospitals, airlines and insurance companies -LRB- a tie -RRB-, automobile repairs and local government. Compared with a similar survey in 1985, banks, hotels, auto repairs and local government services improved. Insurance companies, hospitals and airlines fell. Featured on the down list were airlines, which provoked the observation from the Gallup folks that `` since 1985, the one service which experienced the greatest decrease in high quality ratings is the airlines.'' For the airlines it was the equivalent of a downdraft. In the 1985 survey, 47 percent of those interviewed perceived airline quality as rating no lower than an 8 on the 10-level scale. In 1988, only 32 percent rated airlines that high.

 The government kept silent Wednesday about <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s move to slash <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s stake in <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. PLC, but many business people said <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> should consider ending all investment in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday to reduce its 21.68 percent stake in British Petroleum to 9.9 percent within a year, saying the holding threatened the interests of the <LOCATION> Britian </LOCATION> public. British financial analysts said the investment office, which is owned by the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> government, could lose hundreds of millions of dollars. The Kuwaiti government, which said Tuesday that it was `` extremely dissatisfied'' with the ruling, withheld further comment as officials considered the implications of the order. But the thrust of opinion in economic circles was that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> should be dropped as investment market. Oil-rich <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> has an estimated $ 85 billion invested abroad, mainly in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and other Western European countries. Recent investments have been made in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, including <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, through the <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, which is based in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The state-run radio and television network ignored the British decision in news broadcasts, although pro-government newspapers published the report on their inside economic pages. The state-owned <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the stake in <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION>, declined comment. So did the office of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s oil minister, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalifa </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON> In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Walter </PERSON>, a lawyer with the law firm <PERSON> Stephenson </PERSON> <PERSON> Harwood </PERSON>, which is representing the <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` We have n't decided what we are going to do, nor have we ruled out any possible course of action.'' `` One of the things I am looking at is whether the commission's finding is open to -LRB- a court -RRB- challenge,'' he said The <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> announced last Nov. 18 that it had purchased 10 percent of British Petroleum's shares. The holding was gradually increased to 21.68 percent after the British government put its remaining one-third stake in the oil company up for sale on the stock market. The British Mergers and <ORGANIZATION> Monpolies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s holding in British Petroleum `` may be expected to operate against the public interest'' and recommended it be cut. Lord <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s trade secretary, accepted the findings and told the <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> to reduce the British Petroleum stake. Leading Kuwaiti economists and investment decision-makers strongly criticized the British move, labeling it `` unjustifiable'' and `` a mistake.'' `` It's the worst reaction on the part of a country that promotes a free market economy and deals a blow to this ideology, especially as the decision is taken when a Conservative government, which supports the policy of privatization and capitalization, is in office,'' said <PERSON> Jassim </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Saadoun </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consultancy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's an unjust decision and impairs economic freedom,'' he said. <PERSON> Al-Saadoun </PERSON> predicted <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> would respond by reducing its investment in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> or by asking the British government to buy part of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s holding or extend the 12-month deadline. <PERSON> Ziad </PERSON> <PERSON> Taqi </PERSON>, head of the economic department at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kuwait </ORGANIZATION> said, `` It's a bad and annoying decision which has an adverse impact on the local market.'' If <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> wanted to remain a free market economy that attracts both private and government institutions `` it should not have dealt such a blow to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Taqi </PERSON> said the British government should have stepped in earlier to express its opposition since <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> gradually built up the British Petroleum stake. `` I think the British decision will prompt the -LRB- <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> -RRB- government to reconsider its investment in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>,'' he said.

<HEAD>Boom In Luxury Hotels Could Turn Into A Glut For Chicago</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Four luxury hotels have opened in downtown <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> in the last year and three more are set to open over the next 18 months, but some industry officials fear a glut of high-priced rooms could turn the city's hotel boom into a bust. Since last October, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION>, the Fairmont, the Swiss Grand and the Hotel 21 East have opened their doors, adding 2,000 more rooms. Three more hotels _ the Four Seasons, the Intercontinental and the Hyatt Suites _ are set to open by March 1990, with 1,000 more rooms. All are priced at the upper end of the market, with room rates starting at $ 160 a night. `` Obviously, it's going to have a serious impact on the hotel industry in the <LOCATION> Chicagoland </LOCATION> area,'' said <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Karr </PERSON>, executive director of the Hotel @ <ORGANIZATION> Motel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>, which represents 260 hotels throughout the state. `` The market is not capable of absorbing all the new rooms,'' he said. `` That does n't mean the new hotels wo n't succeed, but there may be a shakeout among the other hotels.'' <PERSON> Karr </PERSON> said there was little new hotel construction in the city between 1981 and 1987, but the expansion of the McCormick Place convention center in 1986 helped spur the current boom. He said the city's hotel industry would be able to handle a normal 4 to 5 percent yearly increase in the number of rooms, but the recent boom has suddenly caused a 16 percent increase, from about 18,000 before 1987 to 21,000 at present. Occupancy rates were about 70 percent last year, and could drop by 2 percent this year due to the hotel expansion, <PERSON> Karr </PERSON> said. He estimated that it would take three to four years for the market to absorb the new rooms. He said the new hotels should have `` some staying power'' because they are part of major chains with strong financial backing and extensive reservations and marketing systems. But he said the glut could hit older downtown hotels as well as suburban hotels, which previously could count on spillover bookings when the downtown hotels were fully booked. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Roper </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Visitors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, conceded that some older or suburban hotels could suffer some fallout, but denied there was any glut `` I do n't see it as a glut,'' he said. `` I see it as an opportunity for economic development in the city, for providing new jobs, because we do have the demand.'' The new hotel rooms would make it easier for <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to attract new business, said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Albian </PERSON>, the convention bureau's market research manager. `` Unlike <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> has a lot of potential left for tourism and corporate business,'' he said. Meanwhile, around <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> hotel managers are gearing up for the increased competition. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> DePorter </PERSON>, regional vice president for the <ORGANIZATION> Hyatt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION>, said it is normal for a new hotel to lose money for the first two to five years as it tries to find its market niche. But he said, `` I do n't think it's going to be a bust ... because the city has been starving for rooms,'' he said. `` It's only a glut if we do n't do anything about it.'' <PERSON> DePorter </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hyatt </PERSON> would try to book more small group business into its suburban hotels to make up for the expected lost bookings. At the Swiss Grand Hotel, which opened in August, general manager <PERSON> Costas </PERSON> <PERSON> Vafopoulos </PERSON>, said its links to <ORGANIZATION> Swissair </ORGANIZATION> should help generate business and the hotel would offer `` European-style service'' catering to international travelers. `` We see great prospects and opportunities in the downtown <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area,'' he said. `` We feel the competition is healthy.'' <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burt </PERSON>, general manager of the 67-year-old <PERSON> Drake </PERSON>, one of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s oldest luxury hotels, said he expects the recently refurbished hotel `` will hold its own'' because it has a loyal clientele. `` I think next year is a big question mark,'' he said. `` No one really has the answer to whether <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> can support all these new hotels.''

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s legal charges that seven Japanese companies manipulated the price of a raw material for computer chips are `` utterly baseless,'' one of the defendants claims. Union Carbide sued Monday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, asking for a jury trial and an order prohibiting the seven from fixing prices and controlling the export to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> of polysilicon, the raw material for silicon wafers. The lawsuit seeks damages for the losses <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> suffered as a result of the alleged conspiracy. The defendants are <ORGANIZATION> Komatsu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>; its parent firm, <ORGANIZATION> Komatsu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Silicon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Osaka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Titanium </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Shinetsu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Handotai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Tokuyama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Ltd.. <ORGANIZATION> Komatsu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, together with its parent, <ORGANIZATION> Komatsu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, issued a joint `` Although <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> calls it an antitrust suit, its complaint is really part of an ongoing contract dispute with <ORGANIZATION> KEM </ORGANIZATION>, arising out of <ORGANIZATION> UCC </ORGANIZATION>'s unfounded interpretation of its contract with <ORGANIZATION> KEM </ORGANIZATION>,'' it said. The statements said <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> is trying to recoup `` self-inflicted losses resulting from its own flawed business decisions at the expense of a Japanese company that has adhered fully to the letter and the spirit of its contractual obligations.'' The suit by <LOCATION> Danbury </LOCATION>, Conn.-based <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> claimed <ORGANIZATION> Komatsu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> and other companies that purchased the material and produced silicon wafers formed a `` polysilicon buyers' cartel'' in 1983. According to the lawsuit, the Japanese companies arranged to `` deplete inventories, to refrain from bidding against one another for fixed supplies in order to minimize open market price increases and otherwise set purchase prices.'' Union Carbide said several <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> polysilicon manufacturers have been forced to exit the merchant market because of the defendants' action The defendants and other Japanese companies banded together and pose as a silicon-wafer industry study group. However, they secretly exchanged information about business costs, pricing, supply and demand and strategic plans to the detriment of non-Japanese companies, the suit said.

<HEAD>Some Farmers Get Drought Insurance Checks; Others Battle Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Illinois farmers who received controversial drought insurance coverage have begun to receive payments, but for those involuntarily left without policies, the legal fight continues, officials said Wednesday. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, assistant director of the state <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> has mailed checks for more than $ 5 million to <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> farmers who received the insurance coverage. <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION>, a New Jersey-based insurance group, has estimated that 1,058 Illinois farmers applied for coverage but only 263 of them received drought insurance policies. Another 715 farmers accepted the company's double-premium refund offer. Agents in the drought-stricken <LOCATION> Cornbelt </LOCATION> advertised the insurance and accepted premium payments late this spring _ when many farmers already suspected it would be a very dry growing season. When underwriters realized that 10 times the $ 30 million intended issue had been sold, they raised the issue to $ 40 million and issued policies only if applications were made by June 15. Those who received insurance coverage were guaranteed payments if the rainfall in their counties from June through August was below certain levels. <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> said most payments to <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> farmers are in the $ 8,000-20 ,000 range However, he said two farmers at <LOCATION> Sheldon </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Iroquois </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> received $ 128,000 and $ 177,000 respectively. <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> so far has made drought insurance payments to five farmers in <LOCATION> Ford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, 29 in <LOCATION> Iroquois </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, 32 in <LOCATION> Kankakee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, 54 in <LOCATION> Livingston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and one each in <LOCATION> Champaign </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> McLean </LOCATION> counties. But many other farmers still hope to receive the drought insurance they thought they purchased _ and the payments that would boost their income significantly. One farm family told the <LOCATION> Champaign-Urbana </LOCATION> News-Gazette that they paid an $ 18,000 premium but did not receive a policy. Instead, they said <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> refunded twice that amount as a `` goodwill'' gesture. However, the family said what they want is the insurance and the payment they would be due under the coverage _ more than $ 160,000. Farmers who paid premiums all over the country are party to a class-action suit in federal court in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> that seeks to force <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> to extend the coverage to anyone who paid a premium and still wants the insurance. The state <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is trying to determine how many <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> farmers paid premiums and did not receive policies, so it can calculate how much <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> would owe to farmers in the state. <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> said his department then is likely to file charges against <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION>, focusing on the fact that the company did not clear the policy with state officials before offering it for sale. `` Our bottom-line interest is protecting state farmers and forcing the company to satisfy our farmers,'' said <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Magazine: Americans Expect Economic Problems, But Not at Home</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than two-thirds of Americans surveyed want to see the rich pay more taxes, while an increasing number of people are growing disenchanted with the new tax law, according to a poll released Wednesday. The sixth annual Money magazine survey on Americans and their money also found many respondents expect the economy to run into problems in the coming months. But those surveyed do n't expect to see their own financial situations worsen. The findings of the survey, conducted by <ORGANIZATION> Lieberman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, were based on questionnaires completed by 2,370 adults nationwide. The survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. The survey, conducted last spring, was the first taken after taxpayers had their initial encounter with filing returns under the new tax law. Thirty-five percent of the respondents said the new law was less fair than the old statute, while 17 percent said it was more fair, 15 percent said it was as fair, and 33 percent said they did not know. In contrast, in a poll taken in October 1986, 22 percent of the respondents said the new law was less fair, while 30 percent said it was more fair, 11 percent said it was as fair and 37 percent did not know. Asked whether they thought they would pay more or less taxes under the new law, 37 percent said they thought they would pay more taxes, 14 expected to pay less and 26 percent said they thought their taxes would remain the same. Twenty-three percent said they did not know. The survey indicated that most Americans want to see the wealthy taxed more heavily. Sixty-nine percent of the respondents said they would be more likely to vote in this election year for a candidate who supported higher taxes for people earning more than $ 100,000 a year. Nine percent said they would be less likely to vote for such a candidate, while 22 percent said this campaign stance would not affect their vote. Respondents were generally not sure over whether they thought they would be better off financially under a Republican or Democratic administration. Nearly half of those surveyed _ 46 percent _ had no opinion on the matter. Twenty-eight percent said they would be better off under a Democratic administration, while 26 percent said they would be better off under the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>. A majority of respondents expected the economy to run into obstacles such as double-digit inflation, unemployment and a serious recession. Fifty-three percent of those surveyed said they expected the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to have serious economic problems during the next year, while 47 percent said they do not expect the economy to have serious troubles. But most of the respondents did not expect economic problems to worsen their own financial situations. Forty-seven percent expected their financial situations to be better in one year's time. Forty-three percent said they expected their financial situations to be the same, while 10 percent expected their situations to get worse. Asked how comfortable their standard of living was, 59 percent of respondents said their standard of living was comfortable, while 41 percent said their standard of living was not comfortable. That breakdown was unchanged from the 1987 and 1985 surveys, and little different from the 1986 poll. Respondents' view of their standard of living increased along with their income levels. For example, 83 percent of respondents in upper income households said their standard of living was comfortable, compared with 27 percent of those in lower-income households. Upper-income households were defined as those with annual incomes over $ 50,000, while lower-income households earned under $ 15,000 a year. The survey was taken more than six months after the October 1987 stock market crash. As a result of the crash, 28 percent of the total respondents and 48 percent of the stockholders said they had made changes in the way they handle their finances, such as making more conservative investments or saving more. Seventy-two percent of the total sample and 52 percent of the stockholders said they had made no changes.

 A bid to merge two of the nation's largest cruise lines was thwarted Wednesday when a Norwegian partner in <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Admiral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cruises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> bought 70 percent of the company's stock for $ 561 million, heading off a similar offer by <ORGANIZATION> Carnival </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cruise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The surprise announcement was made in <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, by Royal Admiral minority stockholder <PERSON> Arne </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilhelmsen </PERSON>. He divulged that his company, the <ORGANIZATION> Anders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wilhelmsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> group, has exercised its right of first refusal to purchase the balance of Royal Admiral's shares. `` This transaction will give <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Admiral </ORGANIZATION> the flexibility and opportunity to boldly move ahead with <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Admiral </ORGANIZATION>'s expansion plans,'' <PERSON> Wilhelmsen </PERSON> said. He also announced his company is negotiating the formation of a joint venture with an entity related to the <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON> family, the owner of the Hyatt and <ORGANIZATION> Hyatt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> chain of 144 hotels. Royal Admiral's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fain </PERSON> said that under the proposed deal with the <ORGANIZATION> Pritzkers </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Wilhelmsen </PERSON> would turn around and sell them 50 percent of the cruise company's stock. `` I think we're pleased that the situation has been clarified and the uncertainty has been eliminated,'' <PERSON> Fain </PERSON> said.. <PERSON> Wilhelmsen </PERSON>'s decision to exercise his right of first refusal ended <ORGANIZATION> Carnival </ORGANIZATION>'s identical $ 561 million offer for the 70 percent of Royal Admiral's stock not already owned by <PERSON> Wilhelmsen </PERSON>. The two cruise lines are based in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. Carnival President <PERSON> Micky </PERSON> <PERSON> Arison </PERSON> was cautious about the announcement, saying only that `` we understand <PERSON> Wilhelmsen </PERSON> now has 30 days in which to close the transaction.'' Carnival spokesman <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> said the company would have no further comment until it had studied the deal. Royal Admiral is the holding company for both <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caribbean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cruise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> and Admiral Cruises. Royal Admiral has eight large cruise ships, including the world's largest, the 2,300-passenger Sovereign of the Seas, and is building a new 1,600-passenger vessel in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Carnival has about the same number of ships, <ORGANIZATION> RCCL </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Steck </PERSON> said. `` Pretty soon we're going to be announcing that we are building one or two sister ships for Sovereign Of The Seas,'' <PERSON> Steck </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Wilhelmsen </PERSON> beat a deadline of October 10 to exercise his option and in the past month has arranged for financing for the purchase through <ORGANIZATION> Christiania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> og </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kreditkasse </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Nova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scotia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wilhelmsen </PERSON> was one of the three original partners in <ORGANIZATION> RCCL </ORGANIZATION> when it was founded in 1970. Earlier this year he and another partner formed <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Admiral </ORGANIZATION> by joining it with Admiral Cruises, <PERSON> Steck </PERSON> said.

 Some food prices climbed above levels explainable by the summer drought but no widespread price gouging of grocery shoppers has been found thus far, congressional investigators said Wednesday. `` Some price increases do appear higher than warranted by the drought alone,'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., said after receiving the report from the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> After weighing the congressional investigative agency's findings, however, he told a hearing of the committee that `` in general, there do not seem to have been excessive price increases across a broad range of products that use the drought as an excuse. Retail pasta prices increased 10.4 percent, cereal 7.1 percent and white bread 8.2 percent from January through June, <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> officials told the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. They said 43 percent of the pasta and cereal price rise and 57 percent of that for white bread came before June. Pasta, cereal and white bread prices rose more between June and August than they did in the same period last year, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. The fierce summer heat and shortage of rainfall, which surfaced as an urgent problem in June, wrought some of its worst damage in the northern Grain Belt where durum wheat used to manufacture pasta is produced. Farm prices for durum as well as hard red spring wheat, a primary ingredient in white bread, did increase this year in contrast to 1987 but alone would not have explained the rise at the retail level. As drought scorched feed and pasture lands, livestock producers increasingly sold cattle for slaughter, creating a buyers market and driving down prices. The decrease, however, was not reflected in any savings for consumers at the supermarket, the investigators said. Just why some prices rose beyond levels explainable as a byproduct of the drought remains something of a mystery, <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> officials said. It may have been because `` prices of packaging of food products went up significantly this year,'' <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenney </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> told the committee. `` There could have been some labor cost increases ... we do n't know if there were,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harman </PERSON>, associate director of the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>'s resources, community and economic development division Senators said it would be unjust to put the blame for unwarranted price increases on farmers, who receive only a minor portion of the price that consumers pay for food. The price of farm commodities accounted for 30 percent of the price of all food products last year. The bulk of the price tag reflects transportation, processing, packaging, advertising and other marketing expenses. After hearing the data, Sen. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Iowa </LOCATION>, said that `` conclusive evidence of price gouging has not been found but there are some indications out there'' that the problem could develop next year. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has been trying to calm concerns about unwarranted price increases. It estimates that the drought will tack 1 percent onto the consumer price index for food this year and perhaps 2 percent next year. Prices would be affected next year because the drought has reduced stockpiled surpluses of some crops, which drives up their prices. Sen. <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>, D-N.D., said he did not rule out that price increases prior to June were related to the drought. He said he had been expecting `` a hot dry summer'' and that the food industry, `` with its excellent sources of intelligence,'' might have done the same. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maurer </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>, appealed to the committee not to condemn farmers for any increases. `` The farmer's share of the food market dollar has remained relatively constant,'' he said. Food wholesaler-retailer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bondareff </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Bonfeld </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said that his Virginia-based food stores have fought to hold the line on prices, and in some cases kept them level despite increases charged by suppliers for fear that higher price tags would give competitors an edge. `` We try to do the right thing because of the competitive nature of the business,'' he told the committee.

 Corn and soybean futures prices edged downward while wheat prices advanced Wednesday at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in a sluggish market under the influence of good harvesting conditions and limited demand. Profit-taking among corn and soybean traders after Tuesday's rallies pressured prices, held down by an outlook for favorable harvesting weather for the next several days in the Corn Belt An anticipated overnight frost in southern <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and other key soybean-growing regions that would have threatened crops failed to materialize and helped keep the lid on buying enthusiasm in the bean pit, said <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Leow </PERSON>, assistant vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Thompson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McKinnon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Wheat gained support from continued expectations that signing of the U.S.-Soviet grain pact is near, she said. `` Anticipation is that once the U.S.-Russian agreement is signed, the Soviets are likely to be given credit, and once they get their credit, they'll be in the market to buy,'' Ms. <PERSON> Leow </PERSON> said. But, she said, activity in the grain and soybean pits remained slow. `` When you've got good harvesting conditions and limited demand, the market's going to be pretty sluggish,'' she said. At the close, wheat was 3 cents to 4 cents higher, with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.26 a bushel; corn was -LCB- cent to 2 \ cents lower with December at $ 2.93 \ a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 2 -LCB- cents lower, with December at $ 2.46 -RCB- a bushel; and soybeans were 3 -LCB- cents to 8 -LCB- cents lower, with November at $ 8.24 a

 About 3,500 members of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union walked off their jobs Wednesday at a <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> assembly plant when negotiators failed to meet a contract deadline. `` We worked through the night trying to resolve the issues but were unable to reach an agreement,'' <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Northard </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Highland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, following the 10 a.m. CDT walkout. `` Our labor relations people are still there trying to reach an agreement.'' <PERSON> Northard </PERSON> declined to specify the issues keeping the two sides apart.

<HEAD>SAS Employees Denounce Texas Air Deal</HEAD>

 Employees of Scandinavian Airlines System in <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> reacted angrily when they heard that <ORGANIZATION> SAS </ORGANIZATION> had signed a cooperation deal with Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, newspaper reports said Wednesday. `` <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is owned and managed by <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, who is notorious in the aviation world. The entire existence of the company is based on a poor product and unethical and often illegal treatment of the employees,'' <ORGANIZATION> SAS </ORGANIZATION>' unions said in a statement. The labor groups branded <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> a `` union buster'' and a strongly anti-union employer, the <LOCATION> Copenhagen </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Berlingske </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tidende </ORGANIZATION> said.

 The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that his agency can no longer cover the cost of rescuing ailing savings institutions without placing `` an exceedingly heavy burden'' on the industry. <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, whose agency regulates the nation's 3,000 <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls, told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> it will cost $ 45 billion to $ 50 billion to clean up the industry, boosting an earlier projection by more than one-third. In July, <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> said it would cost $ 31 billion, an increase in turn from a previous estimate of $ 22 billion. Noting that the bank board has resolved 122 cases so far this year at a cost of $ 20 billion, <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> said it would cost an additional $ 25 billion to $ 30 billion for the work that remains to be done. As much as $ 10 billion of the cost remaining could be spent between now and the end of the year to rescue dozens of additional institutions, he said. Sen. <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., chairman of the committee, complained that <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>'s shifting estimates `` offer little reassurance to the taxpayer'' and said, `` We could be hearing about a $ 100 billion problem just in time for Christmas. <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON> also said the bank board, by issuing promissory notes that are counted toward the federal budget deficit, was spending billions of dollars without congressional authorization. That, he said, would result in other programs, such as anti-drug efforts, being squeezed. Wall's projections now are in line with other government estimates, including the $ 45 billion to $ 50 billion projection of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' General Accounting Office. Private analysts have put the price tag as high as $ 100 billion. However, while the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said its cost estimate meant <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will have to appropriate taxpayer dollars, <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said his agency's resources could cover the cost But, he said, that would place `` an exceedingly heavy burden on the thrift industry.'' Currently, the board's fund insuring deposits in S & amp; Ls up to $ 100,000 gets all of its money from healthy institutions, which pay a special assessment amounting to more than double the regular assessment paid by competing commercial banks for deposit insurance. <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said the only way the bank board can get by without additional funding would be to abandon plans to phase out the special assessment and continue it for 30 years, a move sure to provoke an outcry from S & amp; L lobbyists. Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Neal </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.C. </LOCATION>, speaking at a separate session of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, argued that forcing the industry to pay more could push healthy S & amp; Ls into insolvency. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee voted 29-22 to approve a bill sponsored by Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> LaFalce </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, that would increase from $ 10.8 billion to $ 15.8 billion the bank board's authority to borrow through bonds. The board has so far issued $ 3.75 billion of the 30-year bonds, which are in turn paid off through the industry assessment. The committee chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Fernand </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> St </PERSON> <PERSON> Germain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, said the bill could come before the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> as soon as Thursday. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would be `` hard put'' to reject the bill since it had supported $ 15 billion in bond authority last summer when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> authorized the $ 10.8 billion. <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Falce </PERSON> said his bill was intended to give the agency a way to raise money without resorting to promissory notes that ultimately could have to be paid off by taxpayers. But <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> said, `` If we burden the healthy thrifts with billions of more dollars in interest payments, we run the risk of making the problem worse.'' Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said a taxpayer bailout will be needed sooner or later and that <PERSON> LaFalce </PERSON>'s bill `` is just a ploy to show we are trying to do something before the election.'' The bill also requires the bank board to provide <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> with all documents on its rescue deals within 15 days. Legislators have complained that the agency has kept so much information private that they have no way of judging the deals or estimating their impact on the budget deficit. In a related matter, the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> postponed until Thursday action on a bill creating a commission of experts to study the S & amp; L crisis and recommend solutions early next year. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passed a similar bill last month.

<HEAD>Analysts Say New Offer Puts Pressure on Kroger Co.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment company's latest offer to buy the <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 5.03 billion may force <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>'s management to accept the bid and abandon an effort to remain independent, analysts say <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City-based </LOCATION> company known for corporate takeovers, improved its offer Tuesday to $ 64 a share for the Cincinnati-based supermarket giant. The new offer may outweigh <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>'s proposed corporate restructuring plan and force <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>'s management to give way so that stockholders can get a better deal, analysts said. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>'s management declined Wednesday to make a public statement on the newest offer. `` All we've said is, we're reviewing their proposal,'' <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernish </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION>' offer is its second since it entered the <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> bidding war two weeks ago with a $ 4.6 billion bid, offering $ 58.50 per share. `` I think the purpose of this is a preemptive strike to keep <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> from wasting more time,'' said security analyst <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Giblen </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> investment company <ORGANIZATION> Rotan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mosle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` They're trying to give <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> an offer that is so demonstrably superior to anything they -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- can offer that they'll be forced to capitulate.'' The <PERSON> Haft </PERSON> family of <LOCATION> Landover </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, which controls <ORGANIZATION> Dart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, opened the bidding Sept. 19 with an unsolicited offer of $ 55 per share, or $ 4.32 billion. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathews </PERSON>, senior editor of the trade publication Grocery Marketing, said <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION>'s new bid intensifies pressure on <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>'s management because of management's fiduciary duty to stockholders `` They ca n't reject it out of hand,'' <PERSON> Mathews </PERSON> said. Analyst <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Shiels </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Hilliard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lyons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, said a better offer still could be made. `` I do n't find it as compelling as I would have expected from <ORGANIZATION> KKR </ORGANIZATION>,'' she said of <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION>'s new offer. `` I think <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> has done enough public education on the value of the company that this is n't a hands-down winner. The new offer proposes paying $ 50 in cash, $ 11 in debentures and a continuing equity interest in the company valued at $ 3 for each of <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>'s 78.6 million shares. The offer tops by $ 7 a share <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>'s own offer to shareholders in its board-approved restructuring plan, which would force <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> to lay off an undetermined number of employees at its headquarters. The company also would sell some supermarkets, convenience stores, mass-merchandising stores and real estate. The restructuring plan offers shareholders a $ 40 cash dividend, a debenture with an $ 8 trading value and equity, or stub stock, estimated at $ 9 per share, for a total value of $ 57. <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> also presented an alternative offer, in the event <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> proceeds with its restructuring, to buy all of <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>'s stub shares for $ 13.50 each _ $ 10 in cash and $ 3.50 in debentures. <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> said that would give the shareholders $ 61.50 per share _ the $ 40 cash dividend from <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>, $ 10 from <LOCATION> Kohlberg </LOCATION> and $ 11.50 in debentures. The $ 2.50-per-share difference in <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION>'s two proposals represents the estimated cost of additional financing fees <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> would have to pay if it proceeds with restructuring, plus <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION>'s costs in refinancing the added debt <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> would incur. `` We trust you will agree that this extra $ 2.50 per share in value should be paid to your shareholders and not to your lenders,'' <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> partner <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> wrote in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Everingham </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> said in its first offer that it would keep <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> if it buys the 105-year-old company. The privately held <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> has controlling interests in about 30 companies, including <ORGANIZATION> Beatrice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Owens-Illinois </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Safeway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Duracell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Stop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Shop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>. Fortune magazine estimated the combined 1987 revenues of <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION>'s companies at $ 38 billion <ORGANIZATION> Dart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> has not said whether it would keep <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> In response to <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION>'s newest offer, <PERSON> Dart </PERSON> executive <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Haft </PERSON> said, `` We would be interested in working with <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> management to enhance their restructuring program by providing additional equity.'' He did not elaborate.

<HEAD>State Leaders Don't Fear Grand Metropolitan As They Did Dart</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED STYCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Grand Metropolitan PLC, the British company bidding to take over <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, is n't terrifying state officials, lawmakers and charitable organizations as <ORGANIZATION> Dart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> did when it tried to seize <ORGANIZATION> Dayton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hudson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> last year. `` I think it's certainly not a similar situation in many respects,'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Duane </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>, IR-Lanesboro, said Wednesday. `` It does n't appear to be a situation in which -LRB- Grand Metropolitan -RRB- may come into the community, plunder and leave when they're done.'' Both <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Dayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> are Minneapolis-based companies that have earned favorite-son status for their high levels of charitable giving and general community do-gooding. Last year, Minnesotans were horrified when <PERSON> Dart </PERSON>, controlled by the <PERSON> Haft </PERSON> family of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, tried to acquire <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> in a hostile takeover. The Hafts, with a reputation as corporate raiders who made millions from profits on the sale of stock acquired from companies they tried to take over, were considered poor corporate citizens. The <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> rode to the rescue and swiftly acted on <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION>'s request to pass tough anti-takeover legislation in a one-day special session. But because <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> is incorporated in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, the new <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> anti-takeover laws offer no help to the food conglomerate. And, because Grand Metropolitan has quickly presented itself as a responsible company that would do little to upset the status quo, <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> said, the state may not be as hasty to help <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> as it was to help <PERSON> Dayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>. `` It's going to be tough to do for them -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, because they're incorporated in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, not here,'' <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> said. `` It would have to be pretty specific legislation.'' House Speaker <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanasek </PERSON>, DFL-New <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, agreed. `` I'm not too excited about seeing a Minnesota-based company being taken over by one that's headquartered outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but I do n't think there's really anything we could do about it,'' <PERSON> Vanasek </PERSON> said. Still, he said, `` The <PERSON> Dart </PERSON> group has a terrible reputation when it comes to being raiders, and at least Grand Met seems to be a pretty solid company.'' <PERSON> Vanasek </PERSON>, <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> and other state leaders, including Gov. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON>, met with Grand Metropolitan officials Tuesday, the day they officially made their $ 5.17 billion bid for <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, chief executive of Grand Metropolitan's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> operations, who had asked for the meeting, said the company was n't seeking political favors, only a `` level playing field'' in dealing with <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> `` I thought after having gone through the whole <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> situation, this was strange,'' <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> said. `` It was a reversal. <PERSON> Dart </PERSON> certainly did n't come to talk to us.'' But <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> thought the presentation was helpful. `` I think it certainly gave us a chance to understand their point of view and what their attempts are,'' he said. `` I got the impression that they're not a corporate raider. If they're successful at taking <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> over, they'll keep that high community identity.'' State Commerce Commissioner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said corporate takeovers have changed since the <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> deal. Now, companies like Grand Metropolitan quickly approach politicians and the news media to fend off negative publicity. `` What they -LRB- Grand Metropolitan -RRB- were trying to do was to communicate the sincerity of their offer and that they do have a background as a good corporate citizen,'' said <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, who also attended Tuesday's meeting. Not only has Grand Metropolitan handled the situation differently than <PERSON> Dart </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said, but <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> has handled it differently than <PERSON> Dayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, which acted immediately after <PERSON> Dart </PERSON> started its takeover attempt. <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>, in a statement Tuesday, said its board would review the Grand Met offer `` at an appropriate time.'' Company officials refused to make further comment on Wednesday.

<HEAD>Cocoa Futures Prices Surge With Bullish News From Ivory Coast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDSEY TANNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Futures prices of cocoa surged Wednesday at the Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on reports that the <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> _ the world's largest producer _ would not be lowering farmer cocoa prices. The expected move would come at a time when world cocoa prices are at a 13-year low, and traders took the reports as an indication that the <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> will continue to withhold cocoa from the world market, analysts said. In other markets, oil prices plummeted, cattle futures prices were mixed, hog prices were mostly lower, frozen pork bellies declined, corn and soybeans slid, wheat prices advanced and gold and silver prices rallied. The surge in cocoa prices comes at a time when world stocks are at record level, and the <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> is about to begin harvesting their new crop, said <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaul </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Talk that the African nation wo n't lower prices paid to cocoa famers was `` taken as a sign by the market that the <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> ... may perhaps continue -LRB- their -RRB- very limited sales policy,'' and that could turn the surplus into a deficit, she said. Cocoa prices were $ 39 to $ 61 higher with the contract for delivery in December at $ 1,228 a ton. At the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, reports of burgeoning supplies and rumors about <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> defections sent oil futures prices plunging. The November contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION> dropped 47 cents to settle at $ 12.60 a barrel in heavy, hectic trading. The benchmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude traded as low as a $ 12.28 barrel during the session. Crude oil was 12 cents to 47 cents lower with the contract for delivery in November at $ 12.60 a barrel; heating oil was .41 cent to .52 cent lower with November at 37.76 cents a gallon; and unleaded gas was .55 cent to 1.67 cents lower with November at 39.44 cents a gallon. Profit-taking among corn and soybean traders after Tuesday's rallies pressured prices at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> An outlook for favorable harvesting weather for the next several days in the <ORGANIZATION> Corn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Belt </ORGANIZATION> added pressure, analysts said. An anticipated overnight frost in key soybean-growing regions that would have threatened crops failed to materialize and helped keep the lid on buying enthusiasm in the bean pit, said <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Leow </PERSON>, assistant vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Thompson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McKinnon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Wheat gained support from continued expectations that signing of the U.S.-Soviet grain pact is near, she said. Wheat prices settled 3 cents to 4 \ cents higher, with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.26 \ a bushel; corn was -LCB- cent to 2 cents lower, with December at $ 2.93 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 2 -LCB- cents lower, with December at $ 2.46 -RCB- a bushel; and soybeans were 3 cents to 8 -LCB- cents lower, with November at $ 8.23 a There were few outside influences at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the cattle market was `` undergoing some short-term liquidations'' after reaching new contract highs in feeder cattle on Tuesday, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hare </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Linnco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Hog traders were hedging their positions in anticipation of lower prices this fall, he said. Live cattle prices settled .40 cent lower to .35 cent higher, with the contract for delivery in October at 72.02 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .43 cent lower to .15 cent higher with October at 81.72 cents a pound; live hogs were .50 cent lower to .33 cent higher with October at 40.20 cents a pound; and pork bellies were .10 cent to .75 cent lower with February at 49.45 cents a pound. Trading was lackluster with few fundamental factors at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and volume was thin as traders protected their positions, analysts said. Gold was $ 2.60 to $ 2.70 higher, with October at $ 400.80 a troy ounce; silver was up 5 cents in all contract months, with October at $ 6.298 a troy ounce.

<HEAD>Navy Switches Raft Contract Amid Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it is rejecting life rafts made by a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> company and has hired <ORGANIZATION> B.F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Goodrich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to finish the job. Allegations were made earlier this summer about the quality and reliability of Mark 6 rafts produced by <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crafters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Grantsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Lt. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> `` In light of these allegations, we are in the process of testing the Rubber Crafters rafts we have in the fleet to make sure there are no defective rafts there,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> signed a $ 9.9 million contract with <PERSON> Goodrich </PERSON> to produce 850 of the same type of life rafts that are the subject of an investigation, according to <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>. The new contract calls for the rafts to be delivered to the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> by April 1990, although they may be ready sooner. Rubber Crafters had been building the Mark 6 rafts since 1984, he said. The company is being investigated by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. Federal agents raided the company's plant and offices Aug. 8, according to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have stopped accepting rafts from Rubber Crafters. We have a need for additional rafts in the fleet, so we let the contract to <PERSON> BF </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodrich </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> said. Rubber Crafters had delivered 2,200 rafts and was under contract to deliver another 1,300, he said. The company won the contract by outbidding <PERSON> Goodrich </PERSON>. The Press quoted a federal affidavit as saying Rubber Crafters used inferior materials, covered up defects, falsified test results and altered boat serial numbers.

 Gold prices climbed back above the $ 400-a-troy-ounce level in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> trading Wednesday, while the dollar marked time as traders awaited the release of new economic figures. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a bid of $ 400.30 for a troy ounce of gold as of 4 p.m. EDT, up $ 2.70 from late Tuesday's $ 397.60 On the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, a troy ounce of gold rose to $ 400.80 from $ 398.10 on Tuesday. Gold prices rose as traders followed the fortunes of crude oil futures, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, director of futures research at <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Bullion traders have been selling recently as the price of oil plunged. Lower oil prices are a harbinger of lower inflation and reduce the attractiveness of gold, which is a traditional hedge against higher inflation. Oil prices continued to skid Wednesday, but <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said gold traders were heartened by the fact that the near-term contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, struggled back from its lows of the day. The contract closed down 47 cents at $ 12.60 a barrel, after having been down nearly 80 cents at one point. `` The fact that -LRB- oil -RRB- was down 80 cents makes 40 cents look not too bad,'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said. Gold was down in earlier overseas trading. It fell in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 396 a troy ounce, compared with late Tuesday's $ 397.45 In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, gold closed at a bid $ 395.40 compared with $ 396.90 late Tuesday. In <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold fell $ 1.77 to close at a bid $ 400.46. Silver rose in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> after falling in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Silver closed at $ 6.298 a troy ounce on the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, up from late Tuesday's $ 6.248. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, silver traded at a late bid price of $ 6.19 a troy ounce, compared with Tuesday's $ 6.23. Meanwhile, the dollar was little changed in light trading. `` I think we're just poised and waiting to see how the unemployment numbers come out on Friday,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbanel </PERSON>, a first vice president with <ORGANIZATION> Gruntal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. Inc. in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> `` Most of the trade stayed on the sidelines.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to release September unemployment figures on Friday. <PERSON> Barbanel </PERSON> said dollar traders are also waiting for the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s report next week on the trade deficit. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar rose 0.33 yen to a closing 133.48 yen from Tuesday's 133.15 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at a higher rate of 133.65 yen, and in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar rose to 133.38 yen from 133.31 yen late Tuesday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost $ 1.6955 to buy one pound, more expensive than $ 1.6945 late Tuesday.

<HEAD>Banking Commissioner: Report Indicates Continuing Difficulty</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> banks lost $ 2.9 billion in the six months of 1988, more than three times what they lost the first half of 1987, says a report released Wednesday by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Littlefield </PERSON>. The report indicates continuing financial difficulty for <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> banks, said a release by the Department of Banking. First RepublicBank's $ 1.9 billion provision for possible loan losses contributed greatly to the loss, according to the report. First RepublicBank now is under <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> banks' equity capital declined $ 3.5 billion, total assets decreased $ 14.7 billion, and total deposits declined $ 12 billion between June 30, 1987, and June 30, 1988, <PERSON> Littlefield </PERSON> noted. `` What it does show is that there are still problems in the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> banking industry,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Largent </PERSON>, the financial analyst who prepared the report. `` Although the state has problems, not all the problems are equally troubling in all areas or for all size banks,'' he said. Average bank performance generally deteriorates the larger the institution, the report said. The bigger banks generally have an increasingly greater share of problem credits and foreclosed real estate as a percentage of total assets, loans and primary capital, it said. The 38 banks with assets of more than $ 500 million accounted for $ 2.7 billion of the $ 2.9 billion loss, with FirstRepublic Banks representing a $ 2.2 billion loss.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday awarded the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> a $ 617.4 million contract for a new Trident missile submarine, slashing more than $ 26.6 million off the price it paid last year. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials said the award demonstrated they had been right in pressing a <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> shipyard to compete against <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> more than a year ago, even if <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> ultimately succeeded in protecting its monopoly on the huge subs. `` It shows the benefits of competition,'' said Lt. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. `` That previous competition ... is still bearing fruit.''

The award to <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Groton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, covers the one Trident submarine authorized by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the fiscal 1989 budget and will be the 16th in the line. The fixed-price contract specifies the Trident should be delivered by October 1994. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has said it wants to order at least 20 Tridents and possibly more. With the exception of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, the Trident program was the last major <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> shipbuilding program to be opened to competition. <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipbuilding </ORGANIZATION>, a division of <ORGANIZATION> Tenneco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, enjoys a monopoly on the construction of aircraft carriers, in part because no other shipyard has the massive facilities required to build that type of ship. In November 1987, <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> accepted a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> request that it compete against <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> in the Trident program. It submitted a bid for the fiscal 1988 sub as well as option bids on the two additional boats expected to be purchased in fiscal 1989 and fiscal 1990. General Dynamics did the same, and last Jan. 5 the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> announced <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> had succeeded in preserving its monopoly by underbidding <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> awarded the firm a $ 644 million contract for the fiscal 1988 submarine, without revealing what either company had bid for the two option years. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> said Wednesday the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> believes it will save roughly $ 100 million over the life of the contract if the second option is also exercised. The spokesman said the latest award reverses what has been a spiraling price for the huge vessels. The fiscal 1986 submarine cost the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> about $ 587 million. The price climbed to $ 615 million in fiscal 1987, then rose again in January to $ 644 million. `` This contract is cutting more than $ 26 million off that fiscal 1988 buy,'' <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> said. The 560-foot Trident submarines _ also known as the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> class _ are considered the most survivable leg of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s nuclear arsenal. Each of the vessels can carry 24 long-range, multi-warhead nuclear missiles and remain submerged for months at a time. Each of the subs, when completely outfitted with nuclear reactors and government-furnished equipment, cost more than $ 1.4 billion. Eight of the submarines are already commissioned on active duty and a ninth _ the USS Tennessee _ will soon join them.

<HEAD>Eastern Recalls 300 Furloughed Flight Attendants Effective Oct. 21</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday announced the recall of 300 furloughed flight attendants, which follows the recent layoffs of more than 3,000 employees to streamline the money-losing carrier's operations. The furloughed flight attendants are being recalled effective Oct. 21 because of the popularity of a long-term leave of absence program, said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON>. The program was offered as `` a way of minimizing the impact of furloughs,'' and more volunteers were attracted than had been anticipated, <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said. More than 500 flight attendants took the leave offer. Now 300 fired flight attendants will be recalled on the basis of seniority, <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said. Last week, a federal appeals court in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> struck down a lower court judge who had barred Eastern from carrying out the furloughs. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> rejected the union's contention that the layoffs were part of a union-busting campaign by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s parent, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and its Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> Along with the furloughs, which took effect Sept. 10 and represented <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s largest layoff plans in its 60-year history, the carrier eliminated service to 14 cities and closed its <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> hub. Eastern's recall coincides with a seasonal increase in flights to core markets along the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and into the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said additional employees also may be recalled. `` We have to evaluate staffing needs and determine what's what,'' he said

<HEAD>UNCTAD Chief Executive Welcomes Reaction To Reduction Proposals</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A senior <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official said Wednesday he is pleased with the initial response from the international community to a proposal that commercial lenders write off 30 percent of their loans to 15 highly indebted Third World countries. But <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dadzie </PERSON>, Secretary General of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> on Trade and Development, made clear that consensus on how to cope with the debt crisis is far away. In a press statement, however, he voiced confidence that the proposal, outlined in <ORGANIZATION> UNCTAD </ORGANIZATION>'s 1988 report last month, `` served as a catalyst for a rethinking of positions and will continue to do so.'' The countries targeted by the <ORGANIZATION> UNCTAD </ORGANIZATION> plan account for about 60 percent of Third World debt totaling some $ 500 billion. They are <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dadzie </PERSON> said that while the plan called for 30-percent cut of commercial bank debt, `` our calculations can -LRB- perhaps -RRB- be improved in either and upoward or downward direction.'' He saiid it is increasingly obvious that large-scale debt reduction `` can not be accomplished by credit markets acting on their own'' but that it required concerted action by creditors. <PERSON> Dadzie </PERSON> said recent statements by <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the director oof the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> suggest `` that the need for official action is gaining acceptance.'' `` The form of the support, however, remains unclear,'' he added, speaking of a `` highly complex situation.'' <PERSON> Dadzie </PERSON>'s statement was issued at the end of a two-week session of <ORGANIZATION> UNCTAD </ORGANIZATION>'s 131-nation governing body, the Trade and <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>.

 A <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> supermarket chain that pulled tobacco and cigars from its shelves to comply with a new state law on product labeling hinted Wednesday that all its food and drug suppliers face a similar fate if they do n't comply with the statute. <ORGANIZATION> Vons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION> revealed it had given its suppliers 45 days notice that they must either certify their products as free of dangerous chemicals or label the products in keeping with <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s Proposition 65 <ORGANIZATION> Vons </ORGANIZATION>, which has 345 supermarkets in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, pulled pipe tobacco and cigars from its shelves this week because they do n't carry health warnings, as do packages of cigarettes and chewing tobacco. Proposition 65, an initiative approved by <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> voters in 1986, requires warning notices in stores, the workplace, and other areas where people might be exposed any of 242 substances _ including tobacco _ on a state list of chemicals known to cause cancer or birth defects. <ORGANIZATION> Vons </ORGANIZATION> notified 2,000 manufacturers, suppliers and brokers they must either certify their products as free of chemicals on the list or label the products, spokeswoman <PERSON> Vickie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> said Wednesday. That notice, in letters mailed Sept. 21, gives the suppliers 45 days to comply, she said. While the letter does n't specifically threaten to remove unlabeled products from the shelves, the tobacco action underlines the chain's emphasis on labels. <ORGANIZATION> Safeway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Lucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> have mailed similar notices, spokesmen for the grocers said, although <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beta </ORGANIZATION>'s letters do n't specifically threaten to pull unlabeled tobacco from the shelves. One of the authors of the toxins initiative hailed <ORGANIZATION> Vons </ORGANIZATION>' move as the start of a wide trend toward product labeling. But the author, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> of the Environmental Defense Fund, contended the El Monte-based grocery chain did so only under threat of a lawsuit. `` What you see <ORGANIZATION> Vons </ORGANIZATION> doing is enforcing the law against the manufacturers,'' <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> said from the fund's <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> office. `` They're saying, ` Do n't stick us with the warning.' Previously, he said, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> markets had resisted labeling and contended that an industry-funded, toll-free telephone information number on chemicals in food constituted sufficient warning to consumers under Proposition 65. Two tobacco lobbying groups, the <ORGANIZATION> Cigar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Pipe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, contended the industry has met the law's requirements by sending stores warning signs that can be posted on shelves. Distribution of those signs and a program of periodic media advertisements on the hazards of cigars and pipe tobacco began in February, said <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>, who is president of both <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, D.C.-based groups. The antitoxins law sets penalties of $ 2,500 per violation per day for failure to post warnings of hazardous chemicals. Rather than designating a state agency as enforcer, the measure allows citizens or the state attorney general to sue businesses which do n't comply. The grocers' notices to their suppliers all followed an announcement Aug. 2 by several environmental groups that they were prepared to sue seven supermarket chains and a drugstore chain over tobacco labeling. On Friday, state Attorney General <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON> took up the case from the environmental groups and filed suit in state court against <ORGANIZATION> Vons </ORGANIZATION>, Lucky, <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beta </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Safeway </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON>'s, <PERSON> Raley </PERSON>'s, <PERSON> Albertson </PERSON>'s and <ORGANIZATION> Thrifty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drugs </ORGANIZATION>.

 Unions at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> reacted angrily Wednesday to a report that <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> was discussing the possible sale of its <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> air shuttle to developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>. The pilots union warned it would seek a court order to block any such deal, and the head of the machinists union suggested his union would do the same. The unions successfully blocked an attempt earlier this year by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> to transfer the shuttle operation from Eastern to a new subisidiary. According to unidentified sources quoted by the <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, the pricetag on the three-city shuttle was in the range of $ 200 million. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said the company had no comment on the Journal report. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> and his representatives also declined comment. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, in its Thursday editions, quoted <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> as saying he was close to agreement on a deal, and a contract could be signed by next week. The newspaper also quoted unidentified executives it said were close to the deal as saying <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> would pay more than $ 300 million cash for the shuttle. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> was dealing directly with <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> in the deal, the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> quoted its sources as saying. The report came a day after <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> signed an agreement with Scandinavian Airlines System giving the European carrier leases on airport gates in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> area and the right to buy up to 10 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>'s stock on the open market. <ORGANIZATION> SAS </ORGANIZATION> will pay <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> $ 50 million under the accord, which also includes provisions for coordinating marketing, reservations and scheduling as well as training of airline personnel. In <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> pilots union spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said the union `` will take whatever steps are necessary to legally protect Eastern from the sale or transfer of any more of its assets.'' The leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> employees probably would challenge any sale of the shuttle. `` We stopped the spinoff to <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>. It's something we will have to look at as it relates to our ongoing litigation,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union at Eastern. The Machinists filed a federal suit earlier this year to block the plan to make <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s shuttle a separate subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> later dropped that effort. While stressing they did not know if the report was true, some Wall Street analysts said <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> might use the shuttle, which operates between <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, to help draw people to his hotel and casino properties in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> Others expressed skepticism. `` I think it makes some eminent sense,'' said <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Maldutis </PERSON>, an airline analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. One skeptic, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pincavage </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, suggested it would be difficult for <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> to revamp the shuttle to accommodate traffic to <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> The shuttle service, one of the most profitable operations of ailing <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, is mainly geared toward business passengers. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> would more likely sell aircraft or routes to raise cash, rather than a lucrative shuttle operation, <PERSON> Pincavage </PERSON> said. He suggested that discussions with <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> could be a way of putting a pricetag on the shuttle in case <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> declared bankruptcy and it had to be sold.
