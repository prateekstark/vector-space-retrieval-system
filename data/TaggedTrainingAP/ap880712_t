 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> indicated Tuesday that he and Philippine leaders have scored a breakthrough in stalled talks on the future of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said after Tuesday's discussions, `` We both hope that the talks would be over by the end of this month.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told a news conference, `` I'm more than ever convinced that there is a very strong mutuality of interest in the security field and all the reason in the world that somehow we'll be able to work out a continuing partnership.'' A review of the 41-year-old bases agreement, which expires in 1991, has been marked by calls from some people for more compensation from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and by demonstrations against the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military presence. The review began in April and stalled over the issue of how much <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> should pay each year for the <ORGANIZATION> Subic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Air </PERSON> <PERSON> Base </PERSON> and four smaller military installations. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, on a 36-hour visit to <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, met with Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, Foreign Secretary <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> and prominent legislators. He later left for <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, arriving there Wednesday for a one-day stay. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> was the fifth stop on the secretary's nine-nation Asian and Pacific tour He earlier visited <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> and will proceed after <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Marshall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. Both the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Filipino sides refused to discuss details of the compensation proposals. House speaker <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitra </PERSON> told reporters, `` If the Philippine -LRB- side -RRB- gets favorable conditions, I presume this is going to register very well among members of the house.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a reasonable compromise on the bases could mean increased support by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>'s war against the 19-year-old communist insurgency. Under the present accord, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> gives <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> $ 180 million a year in economic and military aid. The bases are the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military facilities outside the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> said last April that $ 1.2 billion a year was a more `` realistic figure.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military had worked out options in case the bases were ousted, but the best choice was to stay in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. He said the two sides had `` perhaps identified some methods that might work'' in reaching a compromise. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> also said the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> military had improved in the past two years. `` There is a far greater degree of professionalism, they are better equipped ... there is a clear mission and a record increasingly of success,'' he said. <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> promised to expedite the delivery of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military equipment to the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> military. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this year provided more than $ 85 million in military help.

<HEAD>Taiwan Eases Ban on Travel From China</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The governing <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday eased a 39-year-old ban on visits to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> by mainland <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> residents and approved expanding indirect trade with <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to include raw materials. The new policy toward rival Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> approved by the 13th <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> congress </ORGANIZATION> after several days of debate also suggested <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> journalists and athletes may be allowed to go the mainland. Under the new policy, the <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, or Kuomintang, will review requests from mainland Chinese to travel to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> if close relatives are gravely ill or die. Intellectuals from mainland <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> `` who are opposed to Marxism-Leninism or have fought to maintain academic freedom'' will be allowed to come to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> if invited. Further relaxation will depend on `` whether and how the mainland responds to our new policy,'' <PERSON> Hsiao </PERSON> <PERSON> Chang-le </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Nationalists </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mainland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, told a news conference. Last October, the Nationalists ended a longstanding ban on travel to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> so <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> residents could visit relatives for family reunions. More than 100,000 have made the trip since. The ban on travel across the <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Straits </LOCATION> was imposed when the Nationalists fled to this island in 1949 after losing a civil war to the Communists on the Chinese mainland. The Nationalists government still claims to be the rightful ruler of all <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and refuses all official contact with <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hsiao </PERSON> said that also under the new policy, mainland Chinese students studying in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> can apply to visit <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> through an unidentified private organization beginning in August or September. He said <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> athletes may be allowed to compete on mainland <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in events sponsored by private organizations and said the island's Olympic committee would study the possibility of sending a team to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> for the 1990 Asian Games. The party statement also indicated reporters may soon be allowed to travel to the mainland for news-gathering, but did not propose relax other travel restrictions opposed by many Taiwanese. Although no direct trade links exist between <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the Nationalists tolerate a flourishing trade through third countries that could reach a record $ 2 billion this year. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> government officials last year announced 29 items could be imported from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> indirectly but the list did not include raw materials and agricultural products now to be tolerated.

 The Democratic candidate in a southern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> congressional race in November won a special primary Tuesday allowing him to also run to serve out the current term of the late <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Costello </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, easily defeated <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON> in the the 21st Congressional District's Democratic primary. With 429 of the 469 precincts, or 91.5 percent, reporting, unofficial returns showed Costello with 17,040 votes to <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>' 1,930 Republican <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> `` </PERSON> <PERSON> Bob </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaffner </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>, who had no opposition in the special primary, had 3,671 votes. The five-county district has 270,060 registered voters, but morning thundershowers, summer distractions and a lack of interest in the election held down turnout, officials said. The primary winners will face off Aug. 9 in a special general election. The winner of that contest will finish the term of Price, a Democrat from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, who died April 22 of pancreatic cancer. Price, who was 83, had already announced he would not seek re-election after serving 44 years in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. In March, Costello and <PERSON> Gaffner </PERSON> won their respective primaries for the right to run in the November election. After Price's death, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> law mandated a special election to fill the office for the remainder of the term that ends in January. The special election offers its winner a possible advantage in November and, if elected then, seniority over 30 to 40 incoming freshmen House members in January. During the current campaign, <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> stressed his political experience and education. He has served 13 years on the <ORGANIZATION> Aldermanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and has masters' degrees in public administration and education administration. The Costello camp promised to work for economic development, for protection of the Social Security system and against drugs.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> called on communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> Wednesday to resume humanitarian programs to promote reunions between some 10 million people separated from their families on this divided peninsula. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sang-hyup </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, made the proposal in a telephone message to his North Korean counterpart <PERSON> Son </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON> <PERSON> Pil </PERSON>. `` In view of the ardent aspirations of separated family members, it is our imperative task to find out the whereabouts of their dispersed family members and relatives and help them to meet freely,'' <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> said in the message. <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> was divided into the Soviet-backed north and U.S.-supported south at the end of World War II. It is estimated that at least 10 million people were separated from their relatives by the division and during the Korean War in 1950-53. In his message, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> proposed the two Koreas resume by the end of the year a family-reunion program suspended since 1986. His appeal followed a statement Thursday by President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON> who called for improved relations with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, including broad exchanges of visits between people of the two countries. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> dismissed <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s gestures as `` nothing new'' and renewed its own demand for holding a `` national conference'' to discuss, among other things, co-hosting of this summer's Olympic Games in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and the withdrawal of 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Under the North Korean plan, the conference would be attended by about 50 government officials as well as social, political and cultural leaders from each side. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> specifically proposed that the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> societies of the two Koreas serve as an intermediary to help elderly people contact each other. His office said the program could be extended to include some one million overseas Koreans who want to locate relatives in the two Koreas through the Geneva-based <ORGANIZATION> Interantional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. In 1985, for the first time in 40 years, the two governments agreed to an exchange involving 151 people. The agreement also included visits by cultural groups and 51 journalists. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> withdrew from the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> contacts and economic and parliamentary talks in 1986 to protest joint <LOCATION> U.S.-South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> military exercises.

<HEAD>22nd Season Opens With Gala Concert</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Mostly <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON> was Mostly Marvelous. The 22nd season of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s alliterative summer musical festival opened Tuesday night with a gala concert featuring not one, but two, superstar soloists _ American mezzo-soprano <PERSON> Frederica </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Stade </PERSON> and Soviet emigre pianist <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Feltsman </PERSON>. Both made strong impressions. Miss <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Stade </PERSON> sang `` Parto, parto,'' an aria from <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON>'s last opera, `` La Clemenza di Tito'' and both of <PERSON> Cherubino </PERSON>'s arias from `` Le Nozze di <PERSON> Figaro </PERSON>.'' She sounded at ease in all three, her tone aristocratic, yet free and unaffected. Her technique was flawless in the difficult runs of the first selection, with only a hint of strain in the highest part of her register. <PERSON> Cherubino </PERSON> is perhaps <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Stade </PERSON>'s most famous role on stage and she demonstrated why, communicating the restless energy of a lovesick young boy with simple directness. <PERSON> Feltsman </PERSON>, who arrived in this country just last year, provided an elegant performance of <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON>'s last piano concerto, No. 27 in B-flat major. This work, written less than a year before the composer died, strikes a mood of serenity and triumph with little of the turmoil and tragedy that mark the concertos preceding it. <PERSON> Feltsman </PERSON> played with grace and clarity. Ironically, the least satisfying selection of the night was a collaboration between the two _ the concert aria for soprano, piano and orchestra `` Ch ` io mi scordi di te which <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON> wrote for an 18-year-old English singer with whom he had fallen in love. What sets this difficult aria apart is the intricate interplay between the female voice and the piano, each seeming to address the other in long, loving phrases. Miss <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Stade </PERSON> and <PERSON> Feltsman </PERSON> missed the emotional spark and too often seemed to be going through their paces rather than communicating. The opening program _ which is being repeated tonight and televised live on the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> _ was true to the title: mostly <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON>, but with a little something else thrown in. Conductor <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> led a spirited performance of <PERSON> Haydn </PERSON>'s grand and humorous Symphony No 100, known as the `` Military'' symphony. The concert opened with the overture to <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON>'s opera `` Die Entfuhrung aus dem Serail.'' It all went to show once again that <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON>, who died in poverty in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> at the age of 35, left behind a unique and inexhaustible supply of musical riches. What other composer could serve as the mainstay of a music festival that puts on concerts for seven weeks year after year? Highlights of the current season, performed in <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Avery </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, include <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON>'s rarely heard early opera `` <PERSON> Lucia </PERSON> <PERSON> Silla </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Haydn </PERSON>'s `` Lord Nelson'' Mass, and a chamber concert devoted entirely to <PERSON> Schubert </PERSON>

<TEXT>
 Democratic presidential nominee-to-be <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> pondered possible running mates on Monday, with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> pressing more strongly than ever for a spot on the ticket. Signs pointed to an announcement within a few days. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his top adviser, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON>, met at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' house Monday morning <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> then traveled to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to meet with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who said for the first time Monday that he would take <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> up on an offer to join the ticket. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told reporters after his meeting with <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> that `` it is self-evident'' that he wants the job, and said he assured <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> he would be a loyal vice president. `` If it was offered to me, I would accept it,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. He has said repeatedly he deserves an offer of the No. 2 spot, but up until Monday, he had declined to say publicly what his answer would be if that offer were extended. <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> said the two had an `` excellent meeting ... very productive'' but declined to provide any details of the discussion. Afterward, he flew back to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> for a late-night meeting with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. After a 45-minute session at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' home, with campaign manager <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON> in attendance, <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> was asked if a decision had been made. `` No comment,'' he said. Asked if the selection process was over, <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> responded: `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> -RRB- can always ask more questions if he wants.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is expected to announce his choice this week before heading to the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION>, which opens next Monday. Some aides said an announcement could come as soon at Tuesday, but others said there was still no timetable. Although the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor faces a budget crisis at home that threatens to hurt his national candidacy, he arrived at the Statehouse late because of the <LOCATION> Brountas </LOCATION> meeting. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had planned to leave within three hours but ended up staying for nearly seven _ still a few hours shorter than his usual workday. `` Have a good evening,'' was all <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would say to reporters as he left for home after a meeting with three top campaign aides, including campaign manager <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON>. Several campaign aides said privately that the time at home was to be spent working to pick a running mate. `` He has n't made up his mind yet,'' said one <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aide. `` Or if he has, he has n't told anybody.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had been scheduled to meet with <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> last Friday, but the meeting was postponed with <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> saying he needed more time to `` receive and review'' information from the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign had requested detailed personal, financial and medical information from <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and other prospects. The civil rights leader has said he is the most qualified to share the ticket with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and has called the others known to be under consideration `` unknown quantities.'' They include Sens. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and Reps. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides have been aggravated by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s aggressive effort to portray himself as the logical running mate and by an apparent effort by <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign manager <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> to discourage the selection of <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Austin </PERSON>'s comments were unathorized. During a weekend campaign swing through several Western states, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> responded tersely when asked if <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would have veto power over his decision. He said the decision was his alone to make. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is to travel Tuesday night to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, where he is scheduled to hold a series of Capitol Hill meetings on Wednesday and also address the annual convention of the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>. When he arrives back in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> on Wednesday night, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will have two work days left to make good on his promise to resolve the state's budget problems by the end of the week. On his desk is an $ 11.75 billion spending plan for fiscal 1989, which began July 1. Legislative leaders have urged <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to use his line-item veto power to reduce that spending plan. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also is awaiting legislative passage of a politically sensitive plan to eliminate the $ 370 million deficit remaining from fiscal 1988. The governor is scheduled to take Saturday off and fly to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> for the convention on Sunday.

<HEAD>Report Says Mercy Killing Is Common In Hospitals</HEAD>

 Mercy killing is common in many Chinese hospitals, an official report said today. The <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> said that one <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> hospital reported 28 percent of the 563 deaths in its medical, surgical and gynecology departments in the past three years were the result of euthanasia. Incurably ill patients were allowed to die at the request of relatives who wanted to end the patients' suffering, it said. The report said most cases of euthanasia in Chinese hospitals were `` passive,'' meaning the withholding of life-preserving treatment to terminally ill patients. Mercy killing is not a sanctioned medical practice in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, but recent polls have shown substantial popular acceptance. The People's Daily reported last April that a survey of 283 retired people in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> found more than half favored euthanasia for incurably ill patients.

 Six youths were gored seriously and at least 19 others suffered minor injuries in the seventh and most dangerous running of the bulls at the San Fermin Festival. The six bulls and a group of lead steers ran the half-mile stretch from the corrals to the bull ring in less than eight minutes Tuesday, with more than 1,000 youths running ahead. The running took a dangerous turn when one bull stopped and began attacking several youths who had taken refuge in doorways and against the wooden planks lining the route. Every afternoon, the bulls are killed in professional bullfights. The festival began last Wednesday and is to continue through Thursday. Held continously since 1591, the festival gained fame when <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON> used it as a setting for his 1926 novel, `` The Sun Also Rises.'' Since 1591, bulls have gored 52 people to death, 12 since 1924, according to official records.

Blacks spanning <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s ideological spectrum, as well as many whites, say no political breakthrough can occur while <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> is behind bars `` Nothing the South African government can do will gain credibility while it treats Dr. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> as a dangerous enemy,'' Zulu leader <PERSON> Mangosuthu </PERSON> <PERSON> Buthelezi </PERSON> said in a recent speech. `` Black <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> will not rest until he is free.'' <PERSON> Buthelezi </PERSON> is a bitter foe of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the outlawed guerrilla movement <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> led from underground prior to his imprisonment. But <PERSON> Buthelezi </PERSON>, like other blacks who oppose the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>'s strategy of violence, sets <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> apart and discusses him with deep respect. President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s government has considered the idea of freeing <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, and several times in recent years there were flurries of speculation that his freedom was imminent. One such period came last November when authorities freed <PERSON> Govan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mbeki </PERSON>, one of seven <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> leaders sentenced along with <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> to life prison terms in 1964 for plotting a sabotage campaign aimed at overthrowing white-minority rule. The speculation was swiftly dampened when police imposed severe restrictions on <PERSON> Mbeki </PERSON>. Since then, government officials have indicated <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s release is unlikely unless he publicly renounces violence _ a condition he rejects unless the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> is made legal and apartheid dismantled. When convicted for sabotage, <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> already had served two years in prison, having received a five-year sentence in 1962 for incitement and leaving the country illegally. He spent the first 18 years of his life sentence on <LOCATION> Robben </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Table </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. He was transferred in 1982 to <LOCATION> Pollsmoor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prison </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, where he is reported in good physical and mental health. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> reads uncensored newspapers and is expected to earn an advanced law degree later this year through correspondence courses. He was a practicing lawyer before he went underground and has been awarded honorary doctorates from various universities during his imprisonment. He reportedly has a spacious cell with access to a rooftop garden. The government has given permission to <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s family to have a six-hour reunion with him Monday at <LOCATION> Pollsmoor </LOCATION>, by far the longest such meeting since he was jailed. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Winnie </PERSON>, has asked that the birthday be observed `` as a day of peace, in line with the peaceful struggle we have always tried to maintain.'' She has not commented publicly about the recent series of bombings of civilian targets in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> _ attacks South African police officials blame on the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>. Dr. <PERSON> Nthato </PERSON> <PERSON> Motlana </PERSON>, an anti-apartheid activist from <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> and an <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> member before it was outlawed in 1960, said <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> seeks to avoid civilian casualties. He resorted to a strategy of sabotage in 1961 `` because all other avenues were exhausted,'' <PERSON> Motlana </PERSON> said. `` He is the one man who, assuming he is willing, could lead us out of this mess.'' <PERSON> Buthelezi </PERSON> also views <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> as a potential peacemaker, as perhaps the only person capable of ending a bloody power struggle in <LOCATION> Natal </LOCATION> province between militant <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> supporters and more conservative blacks who follow <PERSON> Buthelezi </PERSON>. `` I believe he -LRB- <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> -RRB- would come out of jail to thump anybody ... who set black brother against black brother on the eve of a final victory over apartheid,'' <PERSON> Buthelezi </PERSON> said. Some South Africans believe <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> causes more trouble for the government in jail than he would if freed. Some warn of a violent black backlash if he dies in prison. The largest daily newspaper, The Star, recently urged <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s release on pragmatic grounds It said in an editorial: `` Should <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> die in prison, he will be accorded universal political canonization and <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> will attract even more censure. Once he is free, the Mandela myth would be cut down to size'' The world hears from <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> himself primarily through past statements which relatives and colleagues continue to quote. In one such statement in 1985, he rejected <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s offer of conditional release. `` I can not and will not give any undertaking at a time when I and you the people are not free,'' he said in a statement read by his youngest daughter, <PERSON> Zinzi </PERSON>. `` Your freedom and mine can not be separated. I shall return.''

UPDATE with Brountas holding late-night meeting with Dukakis</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ESPO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> huddled at home with his closest adviser Monday as time grew short to pick a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential running mate. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> openly sought the nomination widely expected to go elsewhere, saying `` If it was offered to me I would accept it.'' Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he might consider <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> or another former Republican rival as his partner when he picks a running mate next month. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> and then sent his longtime confidant to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to meet with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, runner-up in the primaries and widely regarded as unlikely to receive an offer to join the ticket. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, one of seven known candidates for the vice presidential nomination, termed the session `` an oral interview and @ or exam'' on the topic. He said he gave <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> his `` candid view as to the office of vice president ... and what I thought my qualifications might be.'' He said it was `` self-evident'' he would like to be vice president. But more likely candidates were Sens. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and Reps. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. The increasingly delicate maneuvering came as a <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll found the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor holding a 47 percent to 39 percent lead over <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in a nationwide survey conducted last week. Democratic chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> preached the gospel of party unity at a news conference in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> one week before the party nominating convention opens. He said any disagreements over the party's bare-bones platform `` are gradually being worked out'' between the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> forces. `` I do n't expect there will be any so-called floor fights over the platform,'' he said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> adviser <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> was n't ready to go that far, although he said the two sides are continuing to negotiate in an attempt to work out remaining differences. `` There might be some very serious issues of principle that go to the floor of the convention,'' he said in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supports calls for higher taxes on the wealthy and a five-year freeze in military spending; <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> opposes both. The convention hall itself was a hardhat zone. The television network skyboxes were in place, but painters, carpenters and electricians all worked to ready the <LOCATION> Omni </LOCATION> for the invasion of Democrats, reporters and political junkies that will fill every available inch of space. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> stayed mum on the subject on every Democrat's mind _ his choice of a political partner for the fall campaign. `` Have a good evening,'' was all he said to reporters as he left his statehouse office at the end of the day. But the signs pointed to a decision soon, and the calendar dictated one. An announcement was expected this week, at least in part to allow <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporters time to absorb the decision before their arrival in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. The governor spent part of the day at his statehouse office working on a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> budget crunch, and the balance of the day at home. His aides said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was mulling his choices. He met during the morning with <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON>, and the two had a second, late-night session after <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> returned from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Afterward, <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> refused to say whether a running mate had been picked. `` He has n't made up his mind yet,'' said one <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aide, speaking on condition he not be identified by name. `` Or if he has, he has n't told anybody.'' <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to meet with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, regarded as too liberal and too controversial to get <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' nod. He joked about the subject at one point, saying, `` So far, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has not accepted my offer and I have not refused his.'' But later, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> turned serious. `` If I am not on the team, then the governor must determine who the team members are and what role they will play,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said before the session began. He added, `` Certainly I am convinced that we have the challenge and the obligation to work together to win for the fall. But beyond that we must establish a partnership of equity and shared responsibility.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took a jab at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in a speech to farm editors and broadcasters that he billed as non-partisan. `` I am not the one who feels that the problems of agricultural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> can be solved by planting more Belgian endive,'' he said, poking fun at an off-hand comment <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> made in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> last year. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who is waiting for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to pick a running mate before he does, offered praise of one-time primary foe <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and said he does n't rule out any of the men who ran against him for the Republican nomination. `` The fact that you ran against somebody certainly in my view would not preclude consideration of that person,'' the vice president told a meeting of agricultural editors, writers and broadcasters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` I will say this about <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> _ he and I went head on head. So did <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>. ... My party has never been more unified going into a Republican convention than we are right now, thanks to the way <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and the others have been conducting themselves and their sense of advocacy.'' The vice president said he would solicit advice from a variety of <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers and <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> members, and then `` make a very personal decision.'' But, he said, `` I just do n't want to start going through long lists or short lists because believe me, at this juncture, we do n't have them. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' eight-point lead in the <ORGANIZATION> CBS-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll represented a small drop from a 10-point edge in a similar survey in May. In addition, 28 percent of those polled expressed a favorable view of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, down from 38 percent in May. Twenty-one percent expressed an unfavorable view, up from 14 percent. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s favorable rating was 26 percent, down from 33 percent, and his unfavorable rating was 31 percent, about the same as its 35 percent in May.

<HEAD>Giuliani Urges More Liability For Brokerage Firms</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 One of the best ways to get brokerage firms to combat insider trading is to make them pay when one of their employees gets caught, says the top federal prosecutor of securities law violations. `` It's the only way we're going to get institutions to start taking responsibility for individual behavior,'' <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel on Monday. However, <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> both cautioned that the law should exempt firms and supervisors that make a good-faith effort to stop their employees from using non-public information to profit from trading in securities. `` All of us are certainly sensitive to the fact that whenever anyone runs any institution, large or small, they can be victimized by the criminal activities of others,'' said <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, whose office has prosecuted a string of prominent Wall Street insider trading cases during the last two years. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> said his agency is investigating the role of the firm that employed <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, accused two weeks ago in the second-biggest insider trading case ever handled by the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>, a 24-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> analyst, is accused of passing non-public information to <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> businessman. The $ 19 million in illegal profits they allegedly reaped is second only to the <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> case. `` We will be looking ... at whether <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION>'s supervisory procedures were adequate and whether <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> bears any fault,'' <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> told reporters outside the hearing room. `` If they were directly responsible for the activity ... we might consider including them as one of the parties to the action, but I do n't mean for a minute to suggest that we have any indication of that at all,'' he said. <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> and <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said a draft bill offered by Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> finance subcommittee, should more carefully spell out when brokerage firms would be subject to fines for the violations of their employees <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bachmann </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the trade group representing brokerages, said firms and supervisors should be required to have policies designed to prevent insider trading. But he said they should be held liable only when they actively aided a violation. <PERSON> Bachmann </PERSON> also sought to limit a provision that would allow the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> to pay bounties of up to 10 percent of any insider-trading penalty to informers who tip the agency off to a violation. He said participants in an insider trading scheme should not be allowed to receive bounties. <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> also expressed reservations, saying juries may not believe witnesses who are paid to testify. However, <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has used bounties effectively to prosecute tax cheats. Although tipsters are sometimes peripherally involved in illegalities, it is worth paying a reward when it results in a windfall for federal coffers, he said. `` It's the only way in which you are going to bring this information forward,'' he said. <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> said he intends to pass the bill out of his subcommittee in time for congressional action this year. Other provisions increase the fines for insider trading, create a basis for private investors to sue inside traders and enhance the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s power to cooperate in investigations with foreign securities agencies.

 With hot water going for nearly $ 27 a gallon and potted plants renting for $ 79.50, there is money to be made at next week's Democratic National Convention. The days when delegates pulled into town with a $ 10 bill and a clean shirt and left without changing either are history. The 35,000 visitors for the July 18-21 event are expected to leave about $ 30 million in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. But some local plans to partake of the windfall have gone awry. An employee of an <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> office furniture and equipment rental firm told one caller his company and many others like it had raised prices 30 to 40 percent in anticipation of the convention rush. So many news organizations and some <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> groups flocked to a Detroit-area firm willing to deliver, install, maintain and remove typewriters, computers, copiers, telefax machines and office furniture at roughly half the going <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> cost. For example, water coolers were quoted locally at $ 30 a day. The Detroit firm provides them at $ 30 a month. Some <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> companies are renting typing tables at $ 50 each, waste baskets for up to $ 27 and chairs for as much as $ 40. Convention Florist Service Int' l. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> lists the rental price on 7-foot green plant at $ 79.50. Local florists checked by telephone offered to sell similar plants outright for from $ 45 to $ 65. Hotels are also looking at a boom, with rooms for delegates, reporters, VIPs, fund-raisers, lobbyists, protesters and the curious at a premium. A prospectus for a major textile convention coming to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> in September lists a single room at the <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> at $ 102. A reservations clerk quoted a rate of $ 135 for the Democratic convention. A spot check found some hotels charging higher rates although some quoted rates at or below the rate being charged at the September textile convention. Many of the receptions, news conferences and hospitality rooms scheduled for the convention will be held at the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, home base for most of the 12,000 news media representatives plus the party faithful who can not fit into the convention hall. <ORGANIZATION> MGR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the food service contractor for all events there, will cater about 950 convention functions over four days, from small hospitality suites to a windup `` victory party'' for 30,000. MGR president <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> Noyes </PERSON> said the company is hiring about 500 extra employees to handle the rush. However, the prices have been in effect for a year. `` We are n't the cheapest in the country,'' he acknowledged. `` We provide a highly specialized service and people pay for that. Our business is n't any different. People want a product that's iced down, chilled and ready, and all that goes with it.'' Last year a poll of 500 trade shows and conventions picked MGR as the best convention catering firm in the country. MGR will provide soft drinks at about $ 43 a case. Most meals will be served buffet-style with lunch at $ 14.50 and dinner at $ 18.50. Coffee, or hot water to make tea or instant coffee, is about $ 27 a gallon after tax and a 17 percent service charge are added. Fruit juice will be about $ 29 a gallon. Convention tenants are barred from having their own coffee makers. `` They're charging $ 165 for 100 little pieces of chicken. Everybody is complaining,'' said <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Yolanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroway </PERSON>. `` Prices have not been raised at all,'' said <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sterns </PERSON>, who oversees convention catering for the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. He said <ORGANIZATION> DNC </ORGANIZATION> surveys showed the prices to be lower than those at many downtown hotels. `` They have been very accommodating,'' he said when asked about the price of MGR's coffee service. `` They put in a program where the initial service is $ 50 and they provide a coffee maker. Each day they will deliver supplies at a lower rate for people who want to make their own coffee. They have made some concessions in that way.'' Delegates may get a break, however, if they come down with toothaches. An <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> dentist, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>, is offering free emergency dental service to delegates during the convention.

 Defying terminal cancer, President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> returned from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to begin catching up on official business after six weeks' absence. `` I am here now to reassume the presidency, in order to continue working for what I most love: democracy,'' the 62-year-old <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> said upon arriving Monday from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> capital, where he underwent diagnosis and treatment beginning May 31. `` I certainly am not cured. But I am strong. I have the capacity and the strength to carry out both the medical requisites my disease demands and my work for the people,'' said <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>' staunchest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ally. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, whose five-year term ends June 1, 1989, was leaner than when he left and his face was somewhat drawn. But his step was firm and his embrace appeared strong as he greeted <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> <PERSON> Claramount </PERSON>, the vice president and acting chief executive, and other officials on the tarmac of <LOCATION> Ilopango </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> outside the capital. After a brief airport ceremony, he was driven to the presidential residence to rest. The chemotherapy <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> is undergoing for liver cancer has debilitated him somewhat, but he vowed the illness would not keep him down. Doctors have given him between six and 18 months to live. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> promised to continue working with the military against leftist guerrillas `` in order to bring peace to my people ... in that way I will make it to the first of June and hand power over to the one who is elected by the people.'' <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s governing <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is in the deepest crisis of its 28-year history. Each of two bitterly feuding factions has nominated a presidential candidate. The right-wing opposition won municipal and legislative elections in March. That victory, along with the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>' internal problems, have created the impression that the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> could win the March 1989 presidential election. <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> told a news conference last week that <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s work routine will be established `` according to the evolution of his disease.'' The president is to return to <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> next month for at least one more massive chemotherapy application. Salvadoran officials have said subsequent treatment could be carried out in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Reagan Promises To Consider Lawmakers' Opposition To Seabrook
Order</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has promised to weigh opposition to a proposed executive order that could help license the <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, nuclear power plant by circumventing the objections of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Lawmakers from the all-Republican <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> congressional delegation, upset over the proposed federal intervention, said they received the pledge Monday after a White House briefing with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` We found the president very positive, very sympathetic, very understanding,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION> `` It was clear to all of us that the president was going to very actively consider our request that this order never be published.'' <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, expressed optimism that the president may reject the proposal. `` I am very hopeful that this visit has an effect on the president in convincing him that the process was working -LRB- and -RRB- the federal government need not become involved at this time,'' <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON> told reporters outside the White House. <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> added, `` The president did n't say yes or no, but I came away more encouraged about our prospects of blocking this order than frankly I had expected to.'' But Rep. <PERSON> Judd </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, who said before the briefing that he thought it would be extremely difficult to derail the proposal, said afterwards that he felt no more optimistic about the lawmakers' chances. `` He gave us no reading at all as to what his decision would be,'' said <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>, noting that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> reiterated his strong support for atomic power and expressed concern over state governments' ability to block reactor licenses `` The president has not made a decision,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION> `` He will weigh our evidence and our advice. That's the best we can hope for at this time. The four lawmakers, loyal and long-time allies of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, have expressed support for plant licensing as long as federal regulators determine that the plant and evacuation plan are safe. Licensing for the <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> reactor has been stalled largely by the refusal of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to submit evacuation plans for the six <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> communities that fall within the plant's 10-mile emergency zone. The proposed executive order would give the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which has served a strictly advisory role in atomic safety issues, the power to design and implement evacuation plans when local governments refuse to do so. The four were infuriated last month when they learned of the proposal through plant opponents, who discovered a draft and leaked it to reporters. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told the delegation that he had not seen any draft of the proposal, which sources said was initiated by the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, pushed by four senators and approved unanimously by the president's <ORGANIZATION> Domestic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and other plant opponents have said it is impossible to evacuate the area quickly and safely because of narrow rural roads and a large summertime population.

 State troopers patrolled city streets Monday to make up for an apparent sick-out by more than 300 officers upset over low wages and the lack of a labor contract. The job action ended at late evening. Police Chief <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodfork </PERSON> said city streets were probably safer than usual because of the 60 troopers in the city. There were 143 officers and troopers on patrol, compared with a usual 83, police said.

Union President <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannatella </PERSON> did not return telephone calls and there was no word from the union on whether it had called for the sick-out. <PERSON> Woodfork </PERSON> said he had no immediate plans to discipline officers who called in sick Sunday or Monday. `` I would just ask the officers who are out sick to search their consciences. Do n't hold the city of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> hostage,'' he said.

<HEAD>1988: Last of the Prime-Time Convention Coverage?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In 1984, there was great hand-wringing over the networks' decision to drop gavel-to-gavel coverage of the national conventions in favor of roughly two hours of live prime-time coverage a night. In 1988, the question that's starting to be asked is whether two hours of prime-time coverage a night is too much. Former NBC News President <PERSON> Reuven </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, who has attended seven conventions as a network producer, saw the end of gavel-to-gavel coverage and expects this year to watch the last prime-time coverage. `` Conventions are now being held by the two major parties only because there's television,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said. `` That's the only justification for the convention at all. There is no journalistic reason for our being there. I think we ought to be there; I do n't think we ought to carry it live `` There's nothing going to happen that you do n't know now sitting here. But we do n't know how to stop. It's like ` The Old Man and the Sea.''' Next week, when the Democrats meet in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, they are certain to nominate <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The only major questions remaining are who his running mate will be and what <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, the runner-up, will do or say. Media-wise political parties know that prime-time bickering turns off voters, so conventions have become little more than prime-time commercials. A one-time major network event, the conventions are becoming a made-for-cable show. Complete coverage will be available on <ORGANIZATION> C-SPAN </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, a trend that will no doubt allow the three major networks to say by 1992 that cable TV provides sufficient coverage to meet the public need and the networks no longer need devote live prime time to the proceedings. Indeed, they are already beginning to say that. `` Our responsibility as a news organization has changed somewhat,'' said <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> producer <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Binford </PERSON>. `` In the past, we felt we had to provide coverage of the entire convention, but now, with cable and C-SPAN and <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION>, the viewers can watch the coverage from many different sources. We're now trying to bring the audience a condensed version of the important events of the night.'' All three networks say their coverage plans are flexible, depending on events. But the intention is to go on the air from 9-11 p.m. EDT each of the four nights. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> plans to start at 8 p.m. on Thursday. C-SPAN will carry each session of the convention live, in its entirety, without commentary or interviews. <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> plans to carry convention updates throughout the day, the convention session in its entirety, followed by a half-hour wrapup, then `` Crossfire'' and `` Inside Politics'88.'' The most devout political junkies can even catch convention highlights from 4-6 a.m. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Gralnick </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s executive producer of special broadcasts, wishes the networks could justify such extensive coverage. `` I think there's a hell of a vibrant political story at the conventions,'' he said. `` I'm a political junkie, and I just find what the Democrats are doing and later the Republicans a fascinating political dynamic.'' But he concedes the conventions `` are not a mass-audience program.'' `` For the sake of the union, I wish they were, but if you look at the number of people who choose to vote out of the universe of people who can vote, you begin to get an answer of why people do n't watch political conventions If they do n't care to vote, they certainly are n't going to watch the end product of the voting.'' <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> stands to become the star of the Democrats' convention. It has anchor power in <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, and with the networks paring down their staffs for budgetary considerations, the cable network is in their league. <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> will have 275 staffers compared to the 300-350 each for the bigger networks. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> is based in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and has a home-field advantage. The three networks are taking 25-50 percent fewer staffers to this year's conventions than they did in 1984. `` I'd be lying if I said it was n't a matter of budget, but more it's a matter of each time you do one of these things, you learn how to do them a little more efficiently,'' said <PERSON> Gralnick </PERSON>. `` It's new times,'' said <PERSON> Binford </PERSON>. `` I think with the new technology, we're able to cover it just as efficiently.'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, himself an innovator of much of the present-day convention coverage, such as anchor booths overlooking the convention floor, agrees that the networks have learned a lot. But, he adds, `` now that we know how to cover it, there's nothing to cover.

^Research Group Calls For Fuel, Gas-Guzzler Taxes</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should raise gasoline taxes by 50 cents a gallon, require cars to get 45 miles per gallon and boost the gas-guzzler tax to raise money for rebates to buyers of fuel-efficient cars, an organization of environmentalists, scientists and business executives said today. Those were central measures in a program outlined by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> for an Energy-Efficient Economy that would set a national goal of maintaining momentum in improving energy efficiency for the rest of the century. `` Energy efficiency does not require sacrifice,'' the group argued in its report. `` We do not advocate saving energy as an end in itself. It makes sense only when saving energy costs less than providing energy, including environmental damage and security risks in the comparison.'' Environmental risks of inefficiency are severe, the group said. Man-made gases, notably carbon dioxide produced by fossil fuels, threaten to warm the earth by as much as eight degrees Fahrenheit in the next century, raising sea levels and drastically changing patterns of rainfall and drought _ a process some scientists say is under way. Increasing the 9-cent-per-gallon federal gasoline tax by 10 cents annually for five years _ three years if crude oil prices double _ would yield $ 40 billion to $ 60 billion a year. Such a tax would help make sure `` consumers are given a price signal that better reflects the real cost of the resource and encourages conservation.'' Some money could be rebated to the poor through income tax provisions. Cars, now required to get 26 mpg, should get 45 mpg by 2000. `` It need not be so'' that the standards would mean less safety from lighter weight if cars are carefully designed, the group said. Cars twice as efficient as current models would cost $ 200 to $ 800 more, the group estimated. The increase would be recouped over the life of the car through lower cost of operation. A stiffer `` gas-guzzler'' tax, which can reach more than $ 2,000 now but generally applies to only a few luxury cars like <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION>, would discourage production of highly inefficient cars and provide funds _ more than $ 1.1 billion a year in 1994 _ to encourage purchase of `` gas sippers.'' The rebate could be `` on the order of $ 1,000'' for models with mileage 50 percent better than today's best _ implying rebates for cars getting about 75 mpg. Energy used per dollar of economic activity declined at a rate of about 2.7 percent per year from 1976 through 1986, and was still declining at a 2.5 percent per year during the economic recovery of 1983 through 1986. The 1986 oil price collapse discouraged further gains, and the decline was only 0.5 percent in 1987. The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says it expects gains of about 0.9 percent a year for the rest of the century. A reasonable international goal would be annual reductions of 2 percent, and `` We suggest that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> set an example by pursuing a goal of at least 2.5 percent per year'' until 2000, the group said.

 Promoting the memory and ideals of civil rights leaders such as <PERSON> Medgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Evers </PERSON> may help black youth steer clear of crime and drugs, says <PERSON> Evers </PERSON>' widow, <PERSON> Myrlie </PERSON>. `` It is so important that we remember our leaders who have passed and those who are with us now, and that our young people know who they are and the contributions that they have made,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Evers </PERSON> said upon acceptance of the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>'s first Chairman Civil Rights Leadership Award in behalf of her husband. `` In so knowing they will have something to aspire to,'' she said, `` they will not as readily go into black on black crime, or into drugs. But there will be a sense of well-being, a sense of going forward. That is what <PERSON> Medgar </PERSON> stood for.'' `` I am so grateful that <PERSON> Medger </PERSON> is being remembered by the organization that he loved so much and the organization that no one could take him away from,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Evers </PERSON> told the 79th annual convention of the National Association For the Advancement of Colored People. <PERSON> Evers </PERSON>, who led the fight against segregation as the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> state field secretary from 1954 to 1963, received national attention as the man who counseled <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Meredith </PERSON> through his successful bid to enter the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> in 1962 Mrs. <PERSON> Evers </PERSON>, currently the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> city commissioner of public works, told the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> about the day her husband was gunned-down in front of their home in <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` I was in the kitchen with the children, as he entered the driveway, the children said ` there's <PERSON> Daddy </PERSON>'s,' as he opened the car door the shot rang out. The children fell to the floor _ as he had taught them _ and I bolted for the door ... thinking ` Oh God, do n't let him be hit.'' <PERSON> Evers </PERSON> had been fatally wounded with a shot from a high powered rifle, `` the kind they used to kill large animals like deer,'' she said. A member of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> was charged and tried twice by an all-white jury which was unable to reach a verdict. Mrs. <PERSON> Evers </PERSON> admitted she `` always felt he never got the recognition for the work he had done and I wanted so badly for people to know about him and his work. ... and his organization, the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> is doing that.'' `` Keeping his memory alive was something he and I had discussed before his death,'' she said. `` We both knew that something was coming and tried to prepare ourselves and each other for the inevitable. And the last two weeks of his life we stopped denying -LRB- that -RRB- something would not happen, -LRB- something -RRB- that we knew was going to happen. `` He told me ` <PERSON> Myrlie </PERSON>, do n't worry about people remembering me _ at some point in history my deeds will speak for themselves.' `` Once I told him he was n't getting enough publicity, and he said ` I do n't want publicity. I'm in it for the people _ it does n't make any difference to me.''

 Israeli troops killed two Palestinians and wounded at least 13 in clashes with stone-throwers in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, hospital officials said. It was the highest one-day casualty toll in nearly a month. After a weeklong closure, the military government reopened Palestinian schools in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> on Monday. But later, it ordered six schools shut through the end of the school year, which will be in August this year because of earlier closings. Israeli officials have called the 800 schools in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> flashpoints of violence. In Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> on Monday stoned four Israeli buses and firebombed a fifth, causing minor damage. Police said an Arab woman was struck by a stone, and two Arabs were arrested. A top <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> official denied charges by <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> security agents impersonated <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> personnel in a ploy to deceive and arrest a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION>. Also Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rejected requests by <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION> news agency that it order the army to return confiscated photographs of the March shooting death of an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier. The worst violence erupted Monday in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s largest city Hospital officials there said an Arab youth was killed and 13 wounded when soldiers opened fire on demonstrators in several clashes. The army said it had reports of one dead and nine wounded. An army spokeswoman said the disturbances erupted after the funeral of an elderly <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> man who died of natural causes. When inciters spread rumors that the man was killed by army gunfire, residents took to the streets, burning tires and throwing bricks and stones at troops from rooftops, she said. Arab reports said the riots erupted after troops shot and killed 17-year-old <PERSON> Sares </PERSON> <PERSON> Anabtawi </PERSON> in a clash. Officials at <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ittihad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Anabtawi </PERSON> died of a gunshot wound in the chest. In subsequent clashes, seven Palestinians suffered gunshot wounds and 15 were beaten by troops, said <PERSON> Ittihad </PERSON> officials. At <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, also in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, six Palestinians were treated for gunshot wounds, including one who was in serious condition with a bullet wound in his chest, hospital officials said. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Anabta </LOCATION>, troops fired on students who hurled rocks and empty bottles at them after classes let out, the army said. Ittihad officials identified the victim as 16-year-old <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Addas </PERSON> and said he was hit by three bullets in the chest. The deaths brought to 220 the number of Palestinians killed since the Dec. 8 start of the uprising against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 21-year occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Four Israelis have also died. Monday's casualty toll was the highest for a single day since June 17, when two Palestinians were killed and 18 wounded during an army raid of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Furik </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s aide <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> said officials investigated the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> charges and `` found no evidence that <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> security personnel impersonated ABC News persons in arresting a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION>'' last month. <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> said he informed <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Roone </PERSON> <PERSON> Arledge </PERSON> of the results. <PERSON> Arledge </PERSON> had protested to <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> last week, demanding an investigation. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> correspondent, said Monday: `` <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> stands by its story. The facts were corroborated by informed <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> sources.'' The network reported last week that <PERSON> Nizar </PERSON> <PERSON> Dakdouk </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Salfit </LOCATION> village in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> was arrested by Israelis posing as <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> personnel, and it had learned `` the impostors were members of the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> secret security service Shin Bet.'' In rejecting the demand by Time and <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION> for release of the confiscated film, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said authorities are entitled to seize material gathered by reporters if it can help solve a crime, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Itim </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. Troops seized the film after Sgt. <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Katz </PERSON> was shot and killed in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> on March 20. The army said at the time the photographs might help investigators track down the assailant. <ORGANIZATION> Itim </ORGANIZATION> said the two news organizations sought to drop their appeal after the army returned the rolls of film on its own, but the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> refused and issued its ruling Monday.

 An <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, business executive accused of passing inside information to a friend settled civil charges Monday by agreeing to pay the government more than $ 282,000. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sturm </PERSON>, 56, signed a consent agreement without admitting guilt, settling a civil insider trading lawsuit filed by the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The commission accused <PERSON> Sturm </PERSON>, identified as the owner of a bank and vice chairman of Omaha-based <ORGANIZATION> Peter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kiewit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a construction and manufacturing company, of getting information from a relative about the corporate takeover of <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> air cargo service. <PERSON> Sturm </PERSON> allegedly passed the information to a friend who bought 30,000 shares of stock with money loaned by <PERSON> Sturm </PERSON> and made $ 128,412 in trading profits, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> contended. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> did not allege that <PERSON> Sturm </PERSON> made any money on the transaction or had used the friend merely as a middleman to shield stock purchases. `` It's as if <PERSON> Sturm </PERSON> actually made the profits and gave it to the friend, although he -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Sturm </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- did n't buy the stock,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Isenberg </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> official in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Isenberg </PERSON> said <PERSON> Sturm </PERSON> _ not his friend _ was charged because <PERSON> Sturm </PERSON> `` was involved in initiating the trade. He financed the trade.'' <PERSON> Sturm </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Gitter </PERSON>, was out of town and unavailable for comment. However, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said in Tuesday's editions that <PERSON> Sturm </PERSON> issued a statement saying he did not pass on or possess material non-public information. `` Nor did I know that merger negotiations were under way,'' the statement read. `` After months of efforts to convince the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> that it has drawn wrong conclusions, and knowing that I did nothing wrong, I have nonetheless chosen to settle this matter rather than to dispute it any further.'' The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> did not identify <PERSON> Sturm </PERSON>'s bank, the relative who tipped him off or the relative's investment bank. But SEC filings at the time of the acquisition identified <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> as the investment banking firm. Besides the $ 154,085 in alleged illegal profits plus interest, <PERSON> Sturm </PERSON> agreed to pay the government $ 128,412 in penalties for a total of $ 282,497.

 <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> says if there are debates on the party platform at next week's convention, the arguments wo n't be bitter ones. <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> suggested Monday that backers of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the certain nominee, were resolving differences with the <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> camp on about a dozen platform planks. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s convention manager, <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, however, left open the possibility of floor disputes. `` We want more specificity in the platform and we're moving in that direction in the discussions,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` There might be some very serious issues of principle that go to the floor of the convention.'' <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> played down that prospect. `` I do n't expect there will be any so-called floor fights on the platform. There may be differences of opinion. There may be agreements to disagree. All the indications that I have are whatever differences had existed, they are gradually being worked out,'' he said. `` I do n't expect that anything related to the platform will distract from the unity that has been built up in the past year,'' he added. He said he did not expect any `` prolonged or protracted or ... acrimonious'' debate. <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> on Monday released a partial list of the speakers for the four convention sessions starting in seven days, and said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had agreed to the convention schedule. The schedule _ still without times without all speakers included _ has a major focus Tuesday night on <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and the platform. <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> said any platform debate would take place late Tuesday afternoon, before prime time and before <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> are scheduled to speak. One concession to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> involved the people who will actually read planks of the platform to the convention and to the nation in prime time. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>, platform chairman, will introduce the document. Then <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporters Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Agriculture Commissioner <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hightower </PERSON> will read portions of it. Also reading planks will be Sen. <PERSON> Barabara </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikulski </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, Rep. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsui </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and State Sen. <PERSON> Lena </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerrero </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Monday night at the convention will include the keynote speech by <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Treasurer <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>. She will be introduced by Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Espy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> _ the first black congressman from the state since Reconstruction. Former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> will speak earlier on Monday. Wednesday night's schedule includes a tribute to Rep. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Udall </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. As previously announced, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' name will be put into nomination by <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Drought Expected To Have Limited Impact On Rice Crop</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Drought could have some impact on the nation's rice crop this year but not in the way heat and dry weather have shriveled corn and soybean prospects, according to <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> analysts The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rice harvest is all from irrigated land, says <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Childs </PERSON> of the Department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. But that does n't necessarily mean rice is drought proof. Much will depend on how the heat affects rice plants and on irrigation practices, including reduced yields from rising water costs, he said Monday. But generally, the drought is not expected to chew deeply into rice this year, at least `` not like you're seeing in the other commodities,'' <PERSON> Childs </PERSON> said. According to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> projections as of June 9, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rice harvest this year could be around 157 million hundredweight, up nearly a fourth from 127.7 million in 1987. Total rice use also is growing, says the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in its latest outlook report. And this growth is expected to continue in 1988-89. Overall, rice demand has increased by 20 million hundredweight in the last four years. `` Greater consumer preference for grain-based foods, aggressive marketing by rice industry organizations and processors, and wider availability of easy-to-prepare rice products have helped raise consumption,'' the report said. `` Growth in the <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> and Hispanic segment of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population and increasing popularity of <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> and Oriental foods among all Americans have also helped expand consumption.'' Another growth has been in the amount of rice used to make beer _ an estimated 17 million hundredweight this year, up from less than 14 million in 1984-85. `` Brewers' use makes up about 20 percent of total domestic consumption and continues to show year-to-year increases,'' the report said. `` <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION>, the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> brewery, uses rice exclusively s an adjunct in several of its products. Gains in market share by this company over the past several years have helped increase rice use in beer, even though growth in total beer consumption has slowed.'' In all, domestic rice use may be about 83.5 million hundredweight in 1988-89, up from 80.8 million in 1987-88 and 76.3 million in 1986-87. Rice exports are forecast at 77 million hundredweight, up from 70 million last year but down from 85.4 million in 1986-87. `` Assuming normal weather in major rice exporting countries, -LRB- export -RRB- competition likely will be intense,'' the report said. Expectations of smaller rice supplies in 1987-88 triggered rice price increases, and in early 1988 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cash prices were substantially higher than world prices. However, those eased when major importers spurned the higher-priced <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rice. `` Also, expectations of increased exports from <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> further weakened world prices,'' the report added. `` Assuming normal weather, world production will increased in 1988-89 and keep prices below -LRB- the level of -RRB- 1987-88.'' For <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producers, rice prices may be in the range of $ 5 to $ 7 per hundredweight, down from $ 7 to $ 7.25 in 1987-88 but above the average of $ 3.75 in 1986-87, the report said.

 A recent survey by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurers </ORGANIZATION> shows that more than 370,000 farmers bought multiple-peril crop insurance this year, a 19 percent increase from 1987. `` Considering that most of these producers acted before there was evidence of a drought indicates that the crop insurance program is taking hold in the farm country as a risk-management tool,'' said <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Gantz </PERSON>, executive vice president of the association. The signup deadline in most areas was April 15, well before the severe drought conditions set in, he said. <PERSON> Gantz </PERSON> said preliminary estimates show 65 million to 70 million acres will likely be protected by crop insurance this year, compared with 62 million in 1987. The face value of protection of insurance written in 1987 was more than $ 6 billion and probably will increase this year, he said. `` These are producers who did n't want to wait for the federal government to come along with a handout,'' <PERSON> Gantz </PERSON> said in his report. `` They acted in a businesslike manner to protect their own farms and their own families from possible disaster.'' The multiple-peril crop insurance program began seven years ago and includes commercial companies that are reinsured against catastrophic losses by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION>, an agency of the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FCIC </ORGANIZATION> also handles insurance directly through master marketers, who account for about 20 percent of the total. <PERSON> Gantz </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FCIC </ORGANIZATION> has indicated there will be no program changes in 1989 for most crops, beginning with those that will be planted this fall.

 The following are excerpts, translated from Russian by the official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, of Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s speech Monday to the Polish parliament, the Sejm, in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 On Soviet-Polish relations: There is still much in Soviet-Polish relations that does not meet the needs of both sides. ... This applies to direct human contacts as well. New crossings will be set up on the Soviet-Polish border, the possibilities of contacts across the border will be expanded and more railway and air lines will connect our countries. The idea of establishing a ferry between <LOCATION> Szscecin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> is being discussed. ... Our joint history is a rich, full-blooded history of two neighboring peoples. We have causes for pride, -LRB- but -RRB- there are things that have to be revealed and shown more fully. This history also has its complexities, what is called ` blank spots.' Notions that are based more on emotions rather than on strict scientific knowledge form at times around them. There is only one road to the truth here: study of facts, calm comparison of viewpoints and scientific discussions. History can not be replayed, but lessons can and should be drawn from it.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 On the <LOCATION> East-West </LOCATION> ideology battle: It is very important in these conditions to clear the ideological struggle of foul play. Psychological warfare and cultivation of mistrust among nations are incompatible with the norms of civilized state-to-state contacts. It is essential to do away with the preaching of militarism, hatred and enmity so that differences between countries become a stimulus for cooperation rather than a hindrance to it. The nations need the truth about one another. Western society has a poor knowledge of realities in the socialist world. It has been hammered into people's heads there since they were in diapers that the Communists are the bad guys who have enslaved their peoples and are sharpening their knives against the free nations of the West. ... We have to abandon our own simplistic approaches in presenting Western realities as well. It is imperative to see all the diversity, the complexity and equivocality, the contradictoriness of what is happening in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> countries _ in economic, political, social and other spheres.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 On conventional arms: As far as the governments of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> countries are concerned, they traditionally look at conventional arms as a legitimate component of power politics and uphold the nuclear deterence concept. While paying lip service to the need to reduce conventional arms, they continue in fact building up their military resources. ... We would, for instance, be prepared to withdraw our matching aircraft from forward-deployment sites in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> if <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> agrees not to base its 72 F-16 fighter-bombers, rejected by <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. ... The time has come for deeper troops and arms cuts in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and this requires expediting work in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> to hammer out a mandate for opening negotiations both on the reduction of conventional forces and armaments and on confidence-building measures on a Europe-wide scale. ... We suggest effecting the cuts in three phases: At the first phase, all the imbalances and asymmetries between <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> as regards both troop strength and primary arms are to be identified and eliminated. This approach could be applied both to the entire <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> continent as a whole and to its individual regions, for example <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, etc. For identifying the imbalances and asymmetries, we suggest exchanging initial data _ even before the talks or simultaneously with their commencement _ in amounts to be dictated by the agreed subject of the negotiations Careful checks on the data, including on-site inspections, are to be run soon after the start of the talks so as to avoid a repetition of the sad experience of the debates on numbers that once deadlocked the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> talks on central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Let me note in passing that if <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> shows readiness, we can discuss the issue of the imbalances and asymmetries even before the start of the formal talks, in connection with the exchanges of data on troops and weaponry. At the second phase, the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Treaty forces are to be reduced by 500,000 men on each side from the levels existing after the elimination of the imbalances and asymmetries. The cuts are to be carried out by disbanding military units along with elimination of their organic arms. At the third phase, the cuts are to be continued so as to finally lend the military units of both military alliances a purely defensive nature. All the reduction phases would provide for effective verificaiton arrangements, including on-site inspections. I would like to add to this that we are prepared not only at the third phase but also from the very start of the cuts to come to terms on the priority reduction of tactical nuclear weapons, tactical strike aircraft and tanks.

<TEXT>
 Bears, deer, skunks and other creatures that usually prefer to stay far from humans are being driven by the drought to unaccustomed boldness in their search for food and water. So far this year, 30 bears have been spotted from <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tahoe </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> compared with the normal three to five annually, and there has been a virtual invasion of skunks in residential areas, wildlife officials said Monday. `` Anything that's green looks good to them,'' said <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Marrugo </PERSON>, the state director of animal damage control. `` The best thing to do is not feed them because they'll come back for more.'' <PERSON> Marrugo </PERSON> said the Reno-Sparks area and neighboring counties are seeing a huge increase in the number of rabbits and skunks near rural homes, although exact numbers are unavailable since many encounters are n't reported. `` There's an explosion of rabbits in the area this year,'' <PERSON> Marrugo </PERSON> said. `` We've already had five or six complaints of damage they've caused in flower beds or hay fields _ not a lot, but the summer's just beginning. A pack of them can ruin 25 acres.'' Skunks also are showing up in record numbers, particularly in the valleys north of <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> and in <LOCATION> Verdi </LOCATION> to the west, <PERSON> Marrugo </PERSON> said. `` One woman in <LOCATION> Verdi </LOCATION> has trapped 29 skunks under her house in the past two years,'' he said. `` It's a virtual invasion in some areas.'' <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON>, a supervising game biologist for the <ORGANIZATION> Nevada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION>, said big game and small animals are migrating in search of new water supplies and range land because back-to-back dry years have decreased forage and stream flows. `` They concentrate around any free water source they find,'' he said. Already this year, more than 30 black bears have been sighted looking for food among humans, mostly around the <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tahoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION> area, he said. In a normal year, the state <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> receives reports of three to five sightings. `` I think you can attribute this to the drought year,'' <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> said. `` Their normal food supply has been impacted so they're looking through the garbage for food `` There have been no confrontations'' with humans, since the bears usually are scared off, <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> said. `` But any time you get urban dwellers directly in contact with a bear there's a lot of _ well _ concerned folks.'' A mild winter spared most of the state's mule deer, leaving a 10-year high of 250,000 of the long-eared, black-tailed creatures competing for scarce forage and water, <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> said. Now, those deer along with bighorn sheep and antelopes are migrating toward farms, ranches and other rural residences in search of food and water. `` During the summer months it will only get worse,'' <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> said. `` I expect a difficult fall, having to deal with all the problems to stop the depredation.'' Shriveling wetlands in the western <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> valleys normally fed by winter snowmelt are another peril of the drought, <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> said. Small die-offs of fish and waterfowl already have occurred, he said, and more are expected. `` It's too early to count our losses yet,'' he said. `` We just have to take the lumps when they come.''

The flames and massive clouds of smoke could be seen across the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> in downtown <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, about 15 miles to the southwest. `` It seems like it's burning down the whole thing,'' said warehouse worker <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomasis </PERSON>. Truck drivers could be seen on television station broadcasts frantically trying to get dozens of trucks away from the building after the fire broke out, some of them driving off while nearly surrounded by flames. <PERSON> Tomasis </PERSON> said the fire broke out in the paper products section of the complex, which includes several buildings, and quickly spread to the meat and produce sections. There were no reports of injuries, said <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said all available firefighters in the city were called to battle the blaze, which was reported at 10:02 p.m., and that about 50 firefighters responded. The warehouse complex covers approximately five square blocks in an industrial area. It serves as a distribution center for the grocery store's <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> supermarkets. <ORGANIZATION> Safeway </ORGANIZATION> has its headquarters in nearby <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Convention Closes Without Resolving Homosexual Ordination Issue</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> leaders have closed their 69th General Convention without adopting a proposal that could have encouraged the ordination of homosexuals. A resolution Monday expanding `` access to the selection process for ordination'' for all persons, including homosexuals _ but refusing to recognize a right to ordination for all _ fell one vote short of passage in the church's House of Deputies. The 900-member House of Deputies, divided between lay and clerical church members, and the 200-member House of Bishops establish policy for the 2.7 million-member church, whose 10-day convention ended Monday. The conventions are held every three years. Delegates considered almost 500 resolutions at the convention, which opened July 2. But the question of ordaining gay priests dominated the final days of the convention. Current church law says candidates for ordination must be at least 21 years of age and pass prescribed medical, psychological and academic tests. But leaders of some of the church's 118 dioceses in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have ordained homosexual priests without running afoul of Episcopal canon law. In 1979, the 66th General Convention approved a resolution stating in part, `` We believe it is not appropriate for this church to ordain a practicing homosexual.'' That resolution, however, is not a part of canon law, which draws a distinction between homosexual activity, which it says is sinful, and homosexual orientation, which it says is not. Church leaders on both sides of the homosexual debate agreed that Monday's vote left the issue unresolved. <ORGANIZATION> Canon </ORGANIZATION> law was left intact and thus maintained discretion within the dioceses as to consideration of homosexual candidates for the priesthood, said the Rt. Rev. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, bishop of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` I'm not unhappy that it did n't pass,'' said the Rt. Rev. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, bishop of <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. `` We are not of one mind on the subject. Until we are, we should be cautious of passing anything until we can speak with authority.'' `` I was disappointed that, to the portion of people who tend to see themselves as being disenfranchised from the church, -LRB- approval of the resolution -RRB- would have given some pastoral concern,'' said the Rt. Rev. <PERSON> O'Kelley </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON>, bishop of central <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. But, <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON> added: `` It does n't cripple the church. Homosexuals are involved in the ordination process in many dioceses already. It is happening anyway.'' Confusion over parliamentary procedure marred the homosexual debate, church leaders said. `` I've been a bishop a long time ... and I have never heard as many parliamentary procedure tactics as I have seen in this house this week,'' Presiding Bishop <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION>. Also Monday, both houses approved a resolution opposing `` abortion as a means of birth control, family planning or sex selection.'' The resolution in its final form acknowledged that women in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have a legal right to medically safe abortion. But it also deleted a passage expressing the church's opposition to any government action barring a woman's right to abortion. Delegates on Monday also approved a resolution extending for two years the experimental use oelief and practice, curtail masculine references to God as much as possible. The church's <ORGANIZATION> Liturgical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> later will evaluate the experiment. Among the final resolutions approved was one calling frrowly rejected the resolution Sunday, when some delegates claimed the boycott would hurt <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses. But the deputies reversed their vote Monday to express solidarity with Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, who has promoted the boycott as a means of protesting racial segregation in that nation.

<HEAD>Black Boxes Could Clear Up Questions About Airliner</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The `` black box'' recorders from the downed Iranian jetliner in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> should be recoverable, clearing up questions about the plane's flight path and whether its pilots received radio warnings, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aviation experts say. Several <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aviation experts, speaking Monday on condition that they not be identified by name, speculated that the recorders likely survived the crash unless the missile from the <LOCATION> USS </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> hit directly where they were located in the rear of the aircraft. And although the commander of the Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> denied the recorders had been found, a published report from <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> quoted unidentified salvage experts as saying that the so-called `` black boxes'' had been recovered from the gulf waters. All commercial jetliners are required to have the recorders, one that monitors cockpit conversation and another that tracks operations of the plane. They are housed in separate boxes that actually are painted orange, but often become blackened by fire in airline crashes. They are located in the tail section of the plane and designed to withstand severe impacts. The <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> A-300 shot down by the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> on July 3, killing all 290 people aboard, was believed to have been equipped with a sophisticated digital flight recorder that would provide a broad range of operating information as well as a cockpit voice recorder. If they are found in good condition and were properly maintained by the Iranians, the recorders could provide a wealth of information to investigators including a detailed reproduction of the plane's flight path from the time of takeoff, the experts said. The cockpit voice recorder, which monitors radio communications and cockpit conversation on a continuous 30-minute loop, would indicate whether the <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> pilots received repeated radio warnings as maintained by the Pentagon. The cockpit tape would be expected to cover the entire flight of the Iranian jetliner as well as the period during which the plane was taxiing and awaiting takeoff at <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for the short trip across the gulf to <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION>. In addition to radio communications, the cockpit tape would reveal conversation within the cockpit and indicate whether the pilots might have intended anything other than a routine flight and whether they might have been distracted by mechanical or other problems causing them to fly off course or fail to acknowledge radio warnings, the experts suggested. The flight data recorder in the A-300 is a sophisticated digital version that provides more than 80 measures involving the plane's flight operations including altitude, heading, air speed and whether the plane was experiencing any flight difficulties The Pentagon has said that the commercial jetliner was perceived in part as a threat to the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> because of the plane's unusual flight path and speed. Officials said the jetliner was descending, traveling faster than normal for a commercial airliner, and heading directly toward the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ship. There also have been discrepancies as to how far the A-300 was off from its intended flight path.

 Part of a deposition by Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> gives conflicting indications of whether he knew about planned payments to the Israeli <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in 1985. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocap </PERSON> on Monday released a 12-page portion of the deposition given to the office of independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>. The deposition was the focus of news reports over the weekend that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> gave differing recollections between November 1987 and February about planned payments to the Israeli party. The planned payments could have constituted a violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. In the deposition, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was asked by <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s office whether he understood that the Israeli government and the labor party were to receive funds from the pipeline. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, referring to a 1985 memo he received from longtime friend <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> about the planned labor party payments, said: `` I ca n't recall specifically, but that certainly would be consistent with my understanding and would explain why Mr. -LRB- then-Israeli Prime Minister and labor party chief <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> was personally interested.'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was then asked whether he had any specific recollection of <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> telling him of the labor party's interest or financial stake in the operation. `` I have a general recollection but even as we sit here now I do n't know how that was all going to be achieved,'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> replied. Pressed to elaborate, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said, `` I have a general recollection that the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was very much interested.'' He added that he could n't recall except through the words of <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s memo in front of him, which `` is consistent with my recollection. Then, for the ensuing 10 pages of the deposition, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> says that <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> did n't make any reference to the labor party's stake in the pipeline in a conversation the two men had, that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> never discussed with <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> where the pipeline money would go and that he never discussed with <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> the propriety of the labor party receiving any funds. Later in the deposition, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> also said that as to an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> stake and labor party stake in the project, `` I have no even general recollection of the benefit to the labor party other than as is expressed in that ... memorandum that you showed me.'' Finally, after 12 pages of questioning about the planned labor party payments, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> suggested he had n't focused on the portion of the memo from <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> relating to planned payments to the labor party until he was questioned that day. After news media reports surfaced early this year about the <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> memo's reference to planned labor party payments, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said publicly that he did n't recall reading that portion of <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s memo relating to any such plan. The lawyer, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocap </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> filed a declaration with <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s office after reporters suggested that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s public statement did n't square with his earlier deposition. <PERSON> Rocap </PERSON> said information about the deposition apparently had been leaked to reporters. `` I was not stating that I had a recollection, specific or general, that the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> had a financial stake in the project,'' the Feb. 18. 1988, declaration said. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, which on Saturday published portions of independent counsel <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s 830-page report on the <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> investigation, said <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> concluded that the memo was the only `` direct evidence'' of a bribery plan and therefore insufficient to conclude that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> violated the law.

 Here is the statement by <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> regarding compensation for the families of victims in the Iranian airliner shooting: The president has reviewed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> where our military forces are protecting vital interests of the free world. He has expressed his complete satisfaction with the policy and reiterated his belief that the actions of the USS Vincennes on July 3 in the case of the Iranian airliner were justifiable defensive actions. At the same time, he remains personally saddened at the tragic death of the innocent victims of this accident and has already expressed his deep regret to their families. Prompted by the humanitarian traditions of our nation, the president has decided that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will offer compensation, on an ex gratia basis, to the families of the victims who died in the Iranian airliner incident. Details concerning amounts, timing and other matters remain to be worked out. It should be clearly understood that payment will go to the families, not governments, and will be subject to the normal <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> legal requirements, including, if necessary, appropriate action by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. In the case of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, arrangements will be made through appropriate third parties. This offer of ex gratia compensation is consistent with international practice and is a humanitarian effort to ease the hardship of the families. It is offered on a voluntary basis, not on the basis of any legal liability or obligation. The responsibility for this tragic incident, and for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of other innocent victims as a result of the Iran-Iraq war, lies with those who refuse to end the conflict. A particularly heavy burden of responsibility rests with the government of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> which has refused for almost a year to accept and implement <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> Resolution 598, while it continues unprovoked attacks on innocent neutral shipping and crews in the international waters of the gulf. In fact, at the time of the <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> incident, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces were militarily engaged with Iranian forces as a result of the latter's unprovoked attacks upon neutral ships and a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> helicopter The urgent necessity to end this conflict is reinforced by the dangers it poses to neighboring countries and the deplorable precedent of the increasingly frequent use of chemical weapons by both sides, causing still more casualties. Only an end to the war, an objective we desire, can halt the immense suffering in the region and put an end to innocent loss of life. Our goal is peace in the gulf and on land. We urge <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to work with the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> for an urgent comprehensive settlement of the war pursuant to Resolution 598. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> forces will continue their mission in the area, keenly aware of the risks involved and ready to face them.

 Two former Royal Jordanian airlines employees are in federal protective custody to testify against a suspected Lebanese terrorist charged with leading the hijacking of their plane in 1985. The two unidentified members of the jetliner's flight crew entered the federal witness protection program after agreeing to testify at the trial of <PERSON> Fawaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Younis </PERSON>, a prosecutor said Monday at a pre-trial hearing in the case. <PERSON> Younis </PERSON>, a former member of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> militia, is charged with leading a group of five men who stormed the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 with AK-47 assult rifles at <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> on June 11, 1985. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said the former airline employees were uprooted from their homes in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and entered the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> protection program after `` their decision to testify in the trial.'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents are still trying to locate an Arab-speaking passenger who identified <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> at a court-ordered lineup last March. `` We believe he is an excellent witness,'' the prosecutor told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Barrington </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> was arrested last September after he and a friend, <PERSON> Jamal </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamdan </PERSON>, went aboard an FBI-chartered yacht in international waters off the coast of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hamdan </PERSON>, who cooperated with the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> in luring <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> to the yacht with the prospect of making a drug deal, is also in protective custody, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. No date has been set for the trial. A federal appeals court is considering whether statements <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> made to <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents during four days of interrogation aboard a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ship in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> can be admitted into evidence. Prosecutors appealed <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>'s ruling in February that <PERSON> Younis </PERSON>' confession was illegally obtained because he did n't understand his right to remain silent <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> ruled that <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> was unable to make a responsible decision because of his unfamiliarity with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> legal system. The judge also noted that during his interrogation, <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> was seasick and suffered pain in his wrists, which were broken when two <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents slammed him to the deck of the yacht. At Monday's hearing, <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said he had found a classified document that contradicted a previous assertion by <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> had never considered placing an attorney aboard the ship to advise <PERSON> Younis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> had told the judge in February that the idea `` just did n't come up.'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, indicating the secret document he had examined contradicted that answer, told <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>: `` You are charged with the knowledge of the information contained'' in the secret documents turned over to the court. On June 30, the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> here ordered <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> to conduct a hearing on whether to admit the document into evidence. The appeals court said the document `` raises questions that go directly'' to <PERSON> Younis </PERSON>' claim he was denied a right to counsel during his interrogation. The judge gave <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> 48 hours to consult government agencies about declassifying the document and scheduled a hearing for next Monday.

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> leads Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by 11 percentage points, 47 percent to 36 percent, in a new poll of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state voters published by The <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. The telephone poll of 503 voters in the state indicated a large portion of each candidates' support is soft, however. Voting `` definitely <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'' were 26 percent, while 21 percent said they would `` probably'' vote for him. Those `` definitely'' for Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> numbered 19 percent, while 17 were `` probably'' for him. Seventeen percent were undecided. The poll was conducted last week by <ORGANIZATION> Elway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, which reported the results Monday. The margin of error was plus or minus 5 percentage points. The poll indicated little difference in the results when <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was matched with several potential running mates, except that the likely <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee lost ground when paired with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who finished second overall in delegates. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s presence on a Democratic ticket pushed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> slightly ahead of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, 44-41 percent.

 Relatives of two women killed when a department store collapsed in a thunderstorm have filed lawsuits charging that the roof was unsafe. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez-Butron </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, whose wife, <PERSON> Graciela </PERSON> <PERSON> Cortinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, was the fifth victim pulled from the rubble, filed two lawsuits Monday. Lopez-Butron accused the <ORGANIZATION> Amigo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Store </ORGANIZATION> of failing to warn his wife a collapse could occur and failing to properly inspect the roof and its drainage system. In a second suit, he accused the store's builders, <ORGANIZATION> Adams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contractors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of failing to install a safe roof, failing to inspect it and failing to properly install an adequate way to drain the flat surface. In that suit, he requests a trial by jury and asks for no more than $ 5 million in damages, interest and court costs. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Cortinas </PERSON> <PERSON> Villarreal </PERSON> filed a suit seeking damages for the death of his mother, <PERSON> Marisela </PERSON> <PERSON> Villarreal </PERSON> <PERSON> Vda </PERSON>. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>. He named <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, owner of the store, and his company, <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amigos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, in the suit, which alleges negligence. Calls to <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>'s home in <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> were not answered Monday. Meanwhile, officials continued to investigate why the building collapsed during heavy rains Thursday, crushing 14 people to death and injuring at least 47 others. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Winslow </PERSON> of the Southern Building Code Congress of <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, said investigators were checking whether some special characteristic of the building caused it to be affected by shifting rainwater that could have led to its collapse. `` In this case, it's going to be very difficult, because of the way the material was removed during the rescue,'' <PERSON> Winslow </PERSON> said. The debris was later carted to the city dump. He also said investigators were looking at whether the weight of the water-soaked building materials could have contributed to the collapse. On Monday, heavier than usual street and foot traffic flowed along the downtown street past where the building once stood. Some passersby slowed to look at the store's swept-clean floor _ all that remains of the three-story structure. Nearby stores that closed during the rescue effort reopened, with the exception of the adjacent <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION>'s, in which rescuers knocked a hole in the wall to reach surviors. <PERSON> Haisook </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, owner of East-West Fashions across the street, said she lost a good deal of business while her store was closed Thursday through Saturday. `` But we had to close. We're going to have to catch up.'' Ms. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said she planned to contact the owner of her building today for a safety inspection.

 Authorities Tuesday captured a convicted murderer who escaped from a state prison yard with two other inmates in a helicopter that lifted off in a hail of gunfire the day before, a state police official said. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, 30, was captured shortly before 1 a.m., said state police Sgt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Balderston </PERSON>. A Corrections officer spotted <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>'s tracks around 7:30 p.m., and called in a canine unit, <PERSON> Balderston </PERSON> said. Officers followed the tracks along the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> to a bridge near <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lunas </LOCATION> about 20 miles south of here. The other two inmates were captured Monday in a dramatic aerial chase along the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> that lasted nearly two hours, officials said. Also arrested was a woman authorities believe is <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>'s girlfriend. The pilot, who flew the same helicopter in the movie `` Rambo III,'' was being held at the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Jail overnight while authorities checked out his story that he had been hijacked, officials said. The copter nearly rammed a pursuing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs helicopter and tried to force a police helicopter into a crane. `` We both hung with him. We knew he had to set down because he was running low on fuel,'' said Maj. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Denko </PERSON>, pilot of the state police chopper. About 100 prisoners were in the exercise yard at the Penitentiary of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION> when the <ORGANIZATION> Aerospatiale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazelle </ORGANIZATION> helicopter, landed around 9:50 a.m. and picked up the three inmates. Guards in two towers opened fire as the chopper took off, said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Caviness </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The copter flew first to a small airport at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lunas </LOCATION>, 80 miles away. Waiting police wounded and captured one inmate in a gunbattle. The woman also was taken into custody, while <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> escaped on foot. The copter then took off again, leading the customs and police helicopters on a 20-mile chase to <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION> International Airport before finally landing as its gasoline supply dwindled. The other inmate was captured there. <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> was serving life plus 60 years for second-degree murder and armed robbery in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> <PERSON> Lackey </PERSON>, 36, of <LOCATION> Curry </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, serving a nine-year sentence for larceny, was wounded in the shoulder and captured at the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lunas </LOCATION> airport. <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, 26, serving life for first-degree murder in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, was captured at the <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION> airport. <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Shoemaker </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION> was also taken into custody at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lunas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> were being held under an interstate compact that provides for prisoner exchanges. Roadblocks were thrown up from <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Socorro </LOCATION> as authorities pressed the search for <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>. Police using dogs and officers on horseback and in airplanes also joined in. `` We understand he may be armed,'' a dispatcher at the <ORGANIZATION> Valencia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> who asked her name not be used said late Monday. `` He is considered very dangerous.''

 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, speaking of painful episodes in their countries' shared history, say no one should shirk from examining the past honestly. But the Soviet and Polish Communist leaders stopped short Monday of uttering the one word that symbolizes the most painful episode in Polish-Soviet relations and the one historical `` blank spot'' most Poles want explicated. Neither said `` <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION>,'' the name of the forest in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> where the bodies of about 4,300 Polish army officers were uncovered by Nazi troops during World War II. Each of the officers, representing the cream of Polish society, was bound and shot with a single bullet to the base of the skull. Official Soviet and Polish histories have long maintained that the officers were killed by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> in 1941, but independent historians and most Poles believe they were killed in 1940 on the orders of <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> by the <ORGANIZATION> NKVD </ORGANIZATION> secret police, predecessor of the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>. A joint Soviet-Polish historical commission was charged last year with investigating the <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> massacre and other painful `` blank spots,'' including the 1920 war between <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s murder of virtually all leading members of the <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in the late 1930s. But Polish officials have in recent days been playing down the possibility of any dramatic admission by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> during his trip to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> this week. On Monday, when <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> began the six-day visit to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s largest <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc ally, a small group of young men climbed atop a bus stop in central <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> and unfurled a banner reading, `` We demand the truth about <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION>. Reparation for deportations.'' `` <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> is a symbol of cruelty,'' said leaflets they handed out. `` It is a still-bleeding blank spot, the explanation of which all Poles demand.'' Among the <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> victims and 11,000 other officers interned by the Soviets whose fates remain unknown, there were 800 doctors, 50 professors and hundreds of engineers, lawyers, teachers and writers, the leaflets said. `` Poles have the right to know the truth about this holocaust on their outstanding fellow countrymen,'' the leaflets said. In his speech to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s parliament on Monday, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> promised that more would be said about `` blank spots.'' `` There are things that have to be revealed and shown more fully,'' he said. `` There is only one road to the truth here: study of facts, calm comparison of viewpoints and scientific discussions. History can not be replayed, but lessons can and should be drawn from it.'' <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> voiced a similar theme: `` Every crime and every human suffering have a moral dimension. They can not be crossed out and one must not remain silent about them. `` Joint works of Polish and Soviet historians are under way. We hope that they will allow us to better learn about the background, course and nature of various dramatic events.'' Anticipating reporters' questions about <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION>, officials scheduled a press conference after the parliament session by the Polish and Soviet chairmen of the historical commission investigating <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION>. The chairmen said they had some reason to question to the Soviet source materials on <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION>, but could not say anything more without extensive further study.

<HEAD>Governing Party Claims Victory, But Final Returns Still Not In</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ANDERSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The governing party says new election returns confirm its claim that its candidate, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>, won the presidency, even though votes are still being counted nearly a week after the election. The <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> denies that final results are being delayed by vote fraud and squabbling among members of the party that is now losing its 60-year near monopoly in Mexican politics. Interior Secretary <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> said Monday that <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> had received 52.89 percent of the 13.24 million votes counted from Wednesday's election. He said the leftist <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>'s candidate, <PERSON> Cuauhtemoc </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>, was second with 29.1 percent and <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON> of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was third with 16.68 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> did not say how many votes remained to be counted. It said it would release final totals on Wednesday and blamed the delays on computer problems and bad weather. <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials conceded Monday that <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> won 58 percent of the vote in his home state of <LOCATION> Michoacan </LOCATION>, compared with 25 percent for <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>. Party officials in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> also said privately that <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> was expected to win in the federal capital, which has one-quarter of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s people. <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> has claimed a national victory and <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON> has said he is leading the balloting. The governing party has not lost a presidential, senate or gubernatorial race since it was founded in 1929. The latest vote tallies `` confirmed the triumph of our candidate for the presidency,'' said <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Vega </PERSON> <PERSON> Dominguez </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairman. `` It is our duty to defend without wavering or compromises -LRB- the governing party's -RRB- popular mandate,'' he said in a statement he read durign a news conference. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Vega </PERSON> denied numerous reports that the vote tally has been delayed by party infighting. `` The -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- is solidly united in its sectoral -LRB- and -RRB- territorial structure and with its broad militant base. The leadership forms a single united will with our victorious candidate,'' he said. The party reportedly has been split between members of the old guard who resist change and reformists loyal to <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>, who is seeking to modernize the political system. Opposition members have said the vote tally has been delayed by traditionalists who want to doctor the returns to reflect the party's usually huge margin of victory _ in excess of 70 percent in past elections. The commission reconvened Monday night to release additional results in races for the 500-seat <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, only to adjourn until Wednesday. <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> said the delay would allow time for the commission to obtain final results for the remaining congressional seats, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and the presidency. Partial returns released Monday gave 242 of the 500 seats in the lower house to the governing party, 31 to <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and 10 to parties that support <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> rejected the commission figures and said the slow vote count was enabling the government and the governing party to manipulate the results. `` The figures of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> are not believable and only can be the product of fraud,'' <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> said. He said his coalition might call a protest march for Saturday in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON> said irregularities in the elections `` have demonstrated the incapacity of the Mexican government to organize trustworthy elections.'' `` There were two elections: those of July 6 conducted by the people, and those conducted by the rulers last night,'' he said. Opposition parties kept vigils outside district offices in an effort to prevent manipulation of the results.

 <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has rejected as nothing new the proposals of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> for improving relations between the two nations, the north's official news agency said today. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> on Thursday unveiled a plan to ease his nation's bitter confrontation with the communist north and pave the way for peaceful reunification of the divided peninsula. `` This is nothing new and is not worth examination,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted a statement issued by <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Peaceful </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reunification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fatherland </ORGANIZATION> as saying The news agency, monitored in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, quoted the statement as saying that if the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> authorities `` truly want dialogue and reunification, they should respond, though a bit late, to our proposal for convocation of a north-south joint conference.'' In the July 7 special declaration, <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> called for broad trade, humanitarian, cultural and political contacts with the north. The two Koreas have been bitter rivals since their land was divided at the end of World War II in 1945. They fought the Korean war in 1950-53. Talks between the two Koreas have been held intermittantly since the early 1970s.

 Contra leaders say there is little hope for a peaceful move toward democracy in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, where the Sandinista government has expelled <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats, quelled dissent and shut a newspaper and radio station. `` They had been acting like a chameleon for months and months. Now they have shown their true colors,'' <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, a director of the U.S.-backed rebels, said by telephone today from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` We just hope that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the free world once and for all accept that they are totalitarian and never had any interest in democracy,'' he said. The Sandinista government on Monday gave the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador and seven other embassy officials three days to leave, accusing them of state terrorism. Opposition newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> radio station <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catolica </ORGANIZATION> were ordered shut down. The moves came a day after police clashed with thousands of demonstrators at an anti-Sandinista rally 40 miles outside <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> said such actions fly in the face of a peace agreement signed three months ago with the Contras in which the government pledged a series of steps aimed at satisfying the rebels' demands for `` democratization.'' `` At this point, I ca n't see any further negotiations for a peaceful transition to freedom in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have made it clear they're just not interested.'' <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> director based in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, said the rebels have been negotiating in good faith with the Sandinistas, but that continued repression inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> would leave them little choice but to return to a full-scale armed struggle. If that happens, <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> said in a telephone interview, much of the blame should be placed on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which in February rejected President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s request for additional military aid to the Contras. `` Those who were clamoring to give peace a chance in February defeated their own purpose by denying us aid,'' <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> said. `` They took away the strength the resistance needed to keep the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> at the negotiating table. It does n't look like we're going to be doing much talking now.

<HEAD>Authorities Free 52 Arrested In Pro-Independence Riots</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> have freed 52 people, some of them <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks, arrested for taking part in pro-independence riots held in March in the Tibetan capital of <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION>, a government newspaper said today. The Guangming Daily said Tibetan authorities decided to show leniency because the protesters expressed regret and some aided police investigations by exposing instigators of the March 5 riots. The report did not say how many people remained in custody. It quoted <PERSON> Yuan </PERSON> <PERSON> Chenquan </PERSON>, deputy chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Lhasa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, as saying most participants in the riots were `` acting blindly'' and only `` a handful of criminals need further investigation.'' The Panchen Lama, Tibetan Buddhism's second-highest official and a supporter of Chinese policy in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>, said in April that 200 people were detained following the riots, which erupted at the end of a <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> religious festival. He said most would be released after questioning. The government has only reported the arrests of four people, in the slaying of a policeman. The Panchen Lama said five people died in the violence, while Western travelers put the death toll at about 24. The newspaper said the 52 people released included young monks from three major monasteries in the <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> area and students from the <ORGANIZATION> Tibet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Buddhism </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. It said that while in custody they studied the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> constitution, criminal law and relevant regulations. The riot began when monks at a prayer festival shouted pro-independence slogans and threw stones at police. Thousands of Tibetans joined in and clashed with police throughout the city. In September and October, similar rioting left at least 14 dead. The rioters, followers of exiled spiritual leader the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, claim <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is illegally occupying the mountain region and demand an independent <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> says <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> has been an inalienable part of the country for 700 years. Communist troops entered <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> in 1950 and in 1959 put down an uprising during which the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> and thousands of his followers fled to exile in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. Animosity between Tibetans and non-Tibetan Chinese reached a peak during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, when radical leftists suppressed Tibetan religion, persecuted worshippers and destroyed <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> temples. Since 1976, the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> government has guaranteed freedom of religion and rebuilt some damaged temples, but tensions have remained.

<TEXT>
 An oil company's image-improvement campaign could mean an end to the Gulf sign that's marked <PERSON> Lottie </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON>'s family business for 70 years <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns Gulf, has notified the 80-year-old proprietor that unless she spends an estimated $ 12,000 to spruce up her gas station, it ca n't carry Gulf products anymore. The word that their pit stop is n't good enough for the corporate world comes as a shock to some of the regulars at the family-owned <PERSON> Gonyo </PERSON>'s Grocery and Gulf station. `` That's kind of sickening,'' said truck driver <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Walger </PERSON>, sweating under the ceiling fans while waiting to pay for an ice-cold beer. `` You do n't find these old landmarks anymore. This is our regular stop.'' `` It's been here years and years,'' said <PERSON> Rusty </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunch </PERSON>, 66, a retired neighbor. `` Lottie's got coffee every morning and light beer in the evening.'' But <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON>, who still offers credit on a promise, said there's nothing she can do to prevent <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> from uprooting the Gulf sign. `` They do n't want us anymore,'' she said, offering a copy of a letter from <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> mandating the improvements by the end of August. Unless the station _ considered one of the oldest <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> stations in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> _ is brought up to standards, it will be `` debranded'' by <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION>, the letter says. In a station-image review in late 1987, the <LOCATION> Gonyo </LOCATION>'s Grocery and <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> service station was found to be lacking in the number of gasoline products it supplies. To keep the corporate logo, the station also needs painted curbs and bumpers, concrete slabs on both sides of the pumps and a canopy. There is no room to add more tanks, and even if the image-building orders were feasible, the improvements would cost at least $ 12,000, said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Krolczyk </PERSON>, the local jobber who has supplied <PERSON> Gonyo </PERSON>'s with gasoline for the past 15 years. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, marketing manager for <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, said customers expect a certain level of service when they see a Gulf and <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> sign, and the image review is an ordinary part of business. `` We're not trying to be heavy-handed or bad guys in this,'' he said. `` We have a responsibility to protect the integrity of our name,'' he said. Integrity is something <PERSON> Gonyo </PERSON>'s usually takes for granted. It's the nearly extinct kind of place where regular customers can keep a running bill <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON> keeps the accounts in a worn cigar box on the counter. <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON>'s grandfather opened the local landmark in 1917 in this tiny community 32 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. The one-room white wooden structure has a smooth plank floor and ceiling fans. Plaques on the back wall honor the family business for 25, then 50 years as a Gulf station. <PERSON> Buster </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON> says that even though his mother's store may be debranded, it will continue to sell gasoline and stay in <LOCATION> Crabb </LOCATION>, sign or no sign.

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> held a lead over Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in a national poll, but the likely <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee's unfavorable rating was also rising. The <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll found <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ahead 47 percent to 39 percent among the random sample of 947 registered voters surveyed by telephone last week. The margin of error was plus or minus three percentage points. The lead for the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor was 8 points. In May the same poll found a 10-point <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> lead, 49-39. Twenty-eight percent of respondents in the new poll expressed a favorable view of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, down from 38 percent in May. Twenty-one percent expressed an unfavorable view, up from 14 percent. Many still had no opinion. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, however, did not benefit from the movement in <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' rating The all-but-certain <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nominee's own favorable rating was 26 percent, down from 33 percent, and his unfavorable rating was 31, about the same as his 35 percent in May. While voters were uneasy about <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' ability to handle an international crisis, they expressed similar reservations about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Thirty-six percent said they would be confident in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in a crisis and 50 percent said they would be uneasy. For <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> it was 30 percent confident, 49 percent uneasy. Similarly, both men received poor ratings on crime. Twenty percent said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was tough enough on crime and 36 percent said he was not; 23 percent said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was tough enough and 49 percent said he was not. On the campaign itself, more respondents thought <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was attacking <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> than thought <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was going after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Thirty-five percent said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was spending more of his time explaining his program while 32 percent said he was spending more time attacking <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>; for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, 50 percent thought he was mostly explaining and 23 percent said he was attacking <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Finally, 60 percent said they thought the candidates meant it when they promised not to raise taxes, but believed the winner probably will have to raise taxes anyway. Another 32 percent said the candidates did not mean it when they promised not to increase taxes. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> lead in the new CBS-Times poll falls between the results of polls done last month. A Gallup poll late in June found a 5-point lead for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, down from a 14-point lead in a Gallup poll in early June, and an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Money </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION> poll in late June had it at 45-42, essentially a dead heat. However, in mid-June <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> led by 12 points in a <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> poll and by 15 points in an <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> poll.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s communist government said for the first time that it is willing to consider taking back large numbers of refugees who have fled the country, a Western refugee official said today. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Co </PERSON> <PERSON> Thach </PERSON> first revealed their new position to <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Siddhi </PERSON> <PERSON> Savetsila </PERSON> during talks in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> on June 20. A <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official who declined to be named confirmed this today. The Western official said <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> previously had said it would consider accepting refugees only on `` a case-by-case basis,'' which the official said `` is their way of saying no.'' `` Now they are saying they are willing to contemplate significant numbers of people returning,'' said the official, who has participated in negotiations on the issue with Indochinese countries since at least 1982. The new position could pave the way for cooperation with Southeast Asian nations that have complained about a recent surge of refugees arriving on their shores. A <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> refugee official today said that there were 45,136 so-called Vietnamese boat people in the region's refugee camps at the end of May, an increase of 11,664 from the previous year. Foreign ministers of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> said in annual talks last week that a repatriation program was one of the new approaches needed to deal with the influx of Vietnamese refugees. The Western official said that in the earlier stages of the Vietnamese exodus by boat, which began with the <ORGANIZATION> communist </ORGANIZATION> victory in 1975, some groups of people later returned to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. In the past three to four years, however, few returns have been allowed. The Thai Foreign Ministry official said <PERSON> Thach </PERSON> told <PERSON> Siddhi </PERSON> that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> was ready to hold talks on the refugee issue with <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and other Southeast Asian nations. He said <PERSON> Thach </PERSON>, in an unusually conciliatory statement, acknowledged that the influx had a `` negative impact on regional countries.'' A Vietnamese <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> on July 7 that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> was ready to discuss the problem with countries and international organizations and that it was taking measures to stop the clandestine exodus. The British colony of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, host to record numbers of boat people in recent months, last week announced it had accepted an invitation from <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> for unprecedented talks on the issue. Hopes for a resolution of the problem recently have focused on repatriation because most people fleeing <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> are considered economic migrants, not people subjected to political persecution. ` The proportion of genuine refugees has never been more than 10 to 20 percent,'' the Western official said. Under a proposal by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other countries, the Southeast Asian nations would relax their tough policies and allow boat people to land safely. Officials would interview arrivals to separate economic migrants from political refugees. The refugees would be resettled and the economic migrants would be returned to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Western Governors Seek New Ways To Boost Economic Growth</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Western governors, scouting for ways to boost the West's fortunes, ventured off the beaten path of conference fare to meet with two gurus of corporate and government change. The governors had some traditional topics on their agenda, including foreign trade, education and job training. But their visitors Monday warned the governors they must adapt and keep pace with a volatile and enormously competitive marketplace. The conference, with the theme `` Sharpening the West's Competitive Edge,'' continues here today The guest speakers Monday were <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON>, author of `` In Search of Excellence'' and `` Thriving on Chaos,'' and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Birch </PERSON>, a professor at the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> and an expert on job creation. The two were united in their plea for greater efficiency and inventiveness, less government intrusion in the marketplace and a willingness to try `` wild and crazy experiments'' at the state level. With Chrysler boss <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON>'s remarks earlier this year that he had contemplated a hostile takeover of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>, `` literally nothing is unthinkable, and ` as goes <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>, so goes the nation,''' <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> said. `` Literally all bets are off. ... The rules are gone.'' Both <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> and <PERSON> Birch </PERSON> said <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s largest companies are laying off people, while most new hires are coming at new, `` niche-seeking'' ventures _ small businesses such as specialty manufacturers. The smaller firms, with fewer layers of management and less tradition, are able to develop new products and grab increasing shares of the market, they said. The Fortune 500 firms have eliminated 3.1 million jobs in the 1980s, while more than 12 million jobs were created by businesses with fewer than 100 employees, said <PERSON> Birch </PERSON>. <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> urged state and federal governments to resist the urge to curb corporate competition, even when it gets scary. `` Let the raiders go,'' he said. Competition and even raid attempts may be just the ticket to bring life to aging, lethargic companies, he said. `` We need to shape up our big companies and encourage our small companies,'' <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> said. States can `` train, train, train -LRB- a workforce that can support and entice new business -RRB-, and as soon as you're finished, retrain, retrain, retrain,'' he said. Incentive pay for teachers and public workers is a good idea and government should demand huge increases in productivity from its workers, <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> said. Gov. <PERSON> Garrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Carruthers </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> urged his fellow governors to find `` radical, but practical ways'' to do business. Colorado Gov. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> said `` the power of the governor's office -LRB- to bring change -RRB- is an illusion'' in some cases, and that states' chief executives have to deal with entrenched bureaucracies and union protections `` States change only when the gun is at the temple,'' he said. Some problems, such as soaring health care costs, are clearly beyond a governor's control, said <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldschmidt </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> of 16 states and three territories, said he and his colleagues were intrigued by the outsiders' comments. `` It really gets your ideas flowing,'' he said. `` It's stimulating.

<TEXT>
 Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> said today that he resigned as president of the Cambodian guerrilla coalition because of assaults on his forces by his supposed allies, the radical communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> have taken advantage of the withdrawal of Vietnamese forces west of the <LOCATION> Mekong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> to step up attacks and ambushes against the <ORGANIZATION> Sihanoukist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>,'' the former Cambodian head of state told reporters. `` In the last few days I have lost quite a few soldiers and officers,'' he said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> want now to liquidate Sihanoukism.'' The prince also criticized backers of the coalition `` who favor the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> outrageously in their distribution of arms.'' He did not specify who he was talking about, but the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>'s main supplier and supporter is <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> announced suddenly in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> on Monday that he was going into exile in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and resigning as president of the alliance that groups his followers, the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and former Premier Son <PERSON> Sann </PERSON>'s anti-communist forces. It was not clear what effect <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s sudden resignation, the latest in a long series of startling moves by the mercurial prince, would have on his future participation in <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> affairs. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> took a `` leave of absence'' as president of the coalition last summer to conduct talks with Cambodian Prime Minister <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>, then resigned Jan. 30, accusing his partners of undermining his negotiations. He rescinded the resignation a month later. Arriving in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> early today, <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> told reporters his decision to step down was `` irrevocable'' this time. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, under its feared leader <PERSON> Pol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON>, ruled <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> from 1975-78, when a Vietnamese invasion ended their bloody reign. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> called on <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other countries to take steps to prevent `` the return of Pol-Potism in all its horror'' in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. He complained that `` certain sponsors of the coalition continue to exploit the <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> name to permit the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> to seize power.'' The prince also said he would not attend multilateral peace talks scheduled to begin July 25 in <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>. He said his son Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Ranariddh </PERSON> would replace him at the talks. The talks, the first to include representatives of all the warring parties, has raised hopes for a political settlement to the longstanding conflict. Last week, <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> met with Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, and senior officials of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> to discuss the peace process. The foreign ministers of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and their Western partners declared at their annual talks in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> should have a central role in the <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> talks and in a future Cambodian government. Even after he resigned, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> State Deparatment spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> believes <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s leadership `` represents the best prospect for a successful resolution of the Cambodian issue and a stable post-settlement government in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> ruled <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> from 1941 until 1970, when he was overthrown in a military coup. He was kept under house arrest by the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, but in 1982 he joined the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Son </PERSON> <PERSON> Sann </PERSON>'s non-communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> in the coalition recognized by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> as <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s legitimate government The foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> met on Monday in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> capital and said they were committed to a political solution. In a joint communique, the ministers said all Vietnamese troops would leave <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> by 1990 or sooner if a settlement is reached. But they said there must be a guarantee that the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> not return to power.

 Wanted: good homes for $ 10,000 worth of shampoo, hair conditioner and bath gel in 97,900 little packets. The Fairmont Hotel is getting rid of those packets that grace many hotel bathrooms as part of its preparations for the Republican National Convention. `` We replaced them ... with superior plastic bottles,'' said hotel spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mers </PERSON>. `` What makes them superior, of course, is you do n't have to rip them open with your teeth and get shampoo in your mouth. And you can get two or three shampoos out of one bottle. Plus people love to take them home as souvenirs.'' De Mers had two questions when the hotel chain's <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> headquarters ordered him to get rid of the packets: how many were there, and who should they go to? It took time to answer the first question. `` I got someone to lead me to the shampoo and started counting. And I counted and I counted and I counted,'' De Mers said Monday. It turned out there were 38,500 packets of shampoo, 54,900 of hair conditioner and 4,500 of bath gel. There still was the question of who should get them. `` You can give food to the foodless and homes to the homeless, but who do you give shampoo to?'' he asked. So the hotel is holding a Send Us The Suds contest, with Aug. 15 _ the day the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> gavels down in the Superdome _ as the deadline for two-page written entries explaining how much shampoo, conditioner or bath gel is wanted, and what it's wanted for `` I would have to say that the more unexpected the reason, the better,'' said <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mers </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're looking purposely for needs that we ca n't possibly anticipate. People should n't stop entering if they have a fairly strange reason they need the shampoo. It may just make them a winner.''

Diplomatic sources familiar with council procedures said council President <PERSON> Paulo </PERSON> <PERSON> Nogueira-Batista </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> delayed the meeting originally scheduled for today after consultations with <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador, <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ja'afar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON>, and members of the council. The 15-member <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> was preparing to consider an Iranian declaration condemning the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for shooting down the plane in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> on July 3. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said all 290 people aboard died. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> are expected to use their veto power as permanent council members to stop any censure resolution or any demand that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fleet leave the gulf. The sources said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had been unable to gain a council majority to condemn the downing of the jetliner and it would present a statement, to be followed by a debate, without submitting a resolution. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> says the USS Vincennes shot down the plane by accident, believing the jetliner was an attacking warplane. The decision to delay the council meeting was made late Monday. Earlier Monday, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government announced an offer of voluntary compensation to families of victims, but not to the Iranian government. <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON>, when asked about the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government announcement, said `` reparation is not sufficient, definitely, because the root cause of this tragedy and similar tragedies should be removed from the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. `` And it can not be anything less than withdrawal of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces from the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>.'' Requesting the council debate is a turnabout for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which has boycotted council sessions for years because it claims the council bows to pressure from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and is biased against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in the 8-year-old war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> wants <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> condemned for murder in the airliner incident. Western diplomats said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is expected to argue that the war and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s refusal to accept a truce are at the root of the problem. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been urging the council to impose an arms embargo on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to compel it to accept a cease-fire called for in a resolution the council passed unanimously on Jul 20, 1987. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has agreed to accept a cease-fire, but <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> demands that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> be branded the aggressor before a truce takes effect. Nations now on the council are the permanent members _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> _ and <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials said they do n't expect damage to a test booster will delay the tentatively scheduled September launch of the first space shuttle since the 1986 Challenger disaster. The accident will, however, postpone the final test-firing of <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>'s redesigned booster from July 25 until the end of August, officials said. The booster was damaged Saturday when a worker testing one of the motor's three field joints inadvertently switched pressurization lines and damaged insulation that helps contain superheated gasses during flight, <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Rocky </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said Monday. However, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Campion </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` We do not expect it to affect the STS-26 launch schedule.'' STS-26 is the designation for the first flight of a space shuttle since the Jan. 28, 1986, explosion destroyed Challenger and killed seven crew members. An 11-member panel from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> will meet next week to evaluate the mishap. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> said the test motor will have to be partially disassembled for evaluation and possible repairs. `` After the rocket is opened up at the joint, we'll have something more to say,'' said <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Atchison </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` At this point, our best estimate is that we do n't anticipate a delay. The damaged test rocket already contained severe intentional flaws designed to determine whether the redesigned joints can withstand the heat and pressure of launch even in the event of some failures. The test rocket incorporates a new design created after Challenger exploded after its launch from the Kennedy Space Center. The explosion was blamed on a faulty booster joint that allowed a plume of superhot gas to burn through an O-ring, triggering the blast.

 Fire swept through a brick apartment building on the city's <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> this morning, killing seven people, officials said. Police were investigating reports that another person may remain in the rubble of the fire, which appeared to have started in trash behind an enclosed wooden back porch at the rear of the building, fire officials said. `` We're interviewing people now to see if we can find any witnesses,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Keane </PERSON> of the police Bomb and Arson Unit. <PERSON> Keane </PERSON> said officials are n't yet certain whether the fire, which spread to an adjacent building, was set. Spokesman <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> of the Fire Department said an empty gasoline can was found, but investigators were not certain whether it was used to set the blaze. Fire Commissioner <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Galante </PERSON> said there were some indications of arson. `` It started in rubbish behind the back porch and spread up to the second and third floors,'' he said. `` In the last hour and a half or two hours, we've had similar fires in the immediate area.'' A spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiner </ORGANIZATION>'s Office who declined to be identified by name said seven bodies had arrived at the morgue. She said the victims had not been identified, and that the youngest appeared to be about 12 years old. Fire officials say the blaze broke out about 1:30 a.m. EDT and was put out by 3 a.m.

 Formulating the strategies of a vast army may come as second nature to Soviet generals, but one thing seems to baffle them: single-sliced, plastic-wrapped American cheese. Col. Gen. <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grinkevich </PERSON>, the chief of staff of Soviet ground forces, paid a visit Monday to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> as part of a <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> delegation that has been visiting American military installations. <PERSON> Grinkevich </PERSON>, one of the highest-ranking officers in the Soviet army, is the highest-ranking Soviet officer ever to visit <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, according to Maj. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, spokesman for the academy.

 A 24-hour `` blue flu'' epidemic that idled nearly a fourth of the city's 1,350 police officers was over today with the city still refusing to recognize a police union for collective bargaining. Police Chief <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodfork </PERSON> said streets were probably safer than usual because of 60 state troopers who were brought into the city for patrol duty. Although the <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orleans </ORGANIZATION> disavowed any connection with the absences, the union's president said job stress was a logical extension of the city's refusal to bargain with the group and raise salaries. Officers began straggling back to work for the start of their late-evening shift Monday, said police department spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryson </PERSON>. `` They have returned to work. We're back up to normal strength,'' he said. He said the 334 officers who called in sick beginning late Sunday represented 24.7 percent of the department's 1,350 or so employees. <PERSON> Woodfork </PERSON> said his department could continue to maintain security in the city of 500,000 even if police union members carry out a threat to stop work during next month's Republican National Convention. <PERSON> Woodfork </PERSON> said there were no immediate plans to discipline officers who called in sick. Mayor <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Barthelemy </PERSON>, who has refused to recognize the union, was out of town Monday and could not be reached for comment.

 Survivors of the terrorist attack aboard the cruise ship City of <LOCATION> Poros </LOCATION> described how a slim young man got up from his deck chair, pulled out an automatic weapon and sprayed bullets at dozens of European tourists. Terrified passengers screamed in panic. Some hit the deck, others ran for shelter. `` A thin man in white with a dark complexion and dark hair jumped up from his seat as if he'd had an electric shock and started yelling in what sounded like Arabic,'' <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Gelia </PERSON>, a 55-year-old Frenchman, told reporters after the attack Monday. `` He took a submachine gun out of the backpack at his feet and started shooting blindly. The first burst went into the air and the next hit the passengers,'' said <PERSON> Gelia </PERSON>, who among 177 French tourists on the ship. <PERSON> Gelia </PERSON> said at least 10 people were wounded in the legs. `` Then he -LRB- the gunman -RRB- said a few more words in Arabic, took out one or two hand grenades out of the backpack and tossed them,'' <PERSON> Gelia </PERSON> said. `` That's all I remember.'' At least 11 people were killed and 98 were wounded in the attack. Survivors said there were three gunmen, one of whom appeared to be wearing a sock for a mask. There were 471 passengers on the City of <LOCATION> Poros </LOCATION>, most sitting on the sun deck or in the saloon immediately below when the terrorists opened fire at 8:40 p.m. When the shooting began, the 370-ton Greek-owned cruise ship was heading to <LOCATION> Piraeus </LOCATION> from the island of <LOCATION> Aegina </LOCATION> after a one-day cruise of the islands. A crew of 22 was on board. `` We were in the back of the boat when we heard a loud bang that I thought had been a collision,'' said British bank manager <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Whittome </PERSON>, who was touring <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> with his wife, <PERSON> Celia </PERSON>, and 12 of her high school students. `` Then there was a second powerful explosion and the roof caved in. There was panic as people tried to get off, they grabbed life jackets and were jumping into the sea,'' said <PERSON> Whittome </PERSON>. Whittome, his wife and the girls slid down ropes into the warm waters of the <LOCATION> Saronic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. `` The girls were very brave. They helped each other, and other passengers into the water. It was a terrifying experience for them,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Whittome </PERSON>, who teaches ancient Greek and Latin. Her husband said they all swam 300 feet to a nearby tug that picked them up and took them to <LOCATION> Piraeus </LOCATION>. The group later flew back to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The hand grenades thrown by the attackers triggered a fire aboard the ship that trapped some passengers in the saloon beneath red hot sheets of metal. Black smoke poured from the ship as the captain radioed for help. `` It was a hellish scene ... one of the terrorists ran downstairs to the saloon firing as he went and there was fire everywhere ... he seemed to be chasing us,'' said a Swedish tourist, who asked not to be identified by name. A French couple in the saloon said they heard `` a few dull thuds and the saw the roof collapsing. `` We also heard the rat-a-tat sound made by machine guns and we rushed up the stairs to get off the ship. Someone gave us life jackets and we jumped,'' said 23-year-old <PERSON> Sylvie </PERSON> <PERSON> Luser </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lilles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. `` I still ca n't comprehend what happened,'' said her husband, <PERSON> Didier </PERSON>. In addition to the tug, two <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> navy vessels, coast guard patrol boats, a passenger ferry and several pleasure craft picked up survivors, <ORGANIZATION> Merchant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials said. The one-day cruise to the islands of <LOCATION> Hydra </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poros </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Aegina </LOCATION> is one of the most popular excursions for foreign tourists visiting <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. The City of <LOCATION> Poros </LOCATION> was one of four Greek-owned cruise ships that make the trip every day.

 Superpower talks on reducing long-range nuclear arsenals resumed today after a seven-week break with both sides identifying at least two major hurdles toward completing a draft treaty. Before the opening session, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chief delegate <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Kampelman </PERSON> reaffirmed <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s stand that a pact that would halve each side's stockpile `` should not be held hostage'' to limits sought by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plans for a large-scale space defense against ballistic missiles. The other chief source of disagreement centers on Soviet insistence on limiting sea-launched cruise missiles. Asked whether negotiators see a possible fifth superpower summit or the end of <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s presidency in January as a deadline, <PERSON> Kampelman </PERSON> told reporters talks will `` continue no matter who is president and no matter who the leader of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is. `` I do n't think important issues should be governed by the calendar,'' he said. `` If it takes longer, fine. If it takes shorter, fine.'' <PERSON> Kampelman </PERSON>, chief Soviet negotiator <PERSON> Alexei </PERSON> <PERSON> Obukhov </PERSON> and their full delegations met for about two hours at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mission to launch the 10th round of <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks since March 1985. The session then recessed for the day, and no date was immediately announced for the next session. The ninth round of talks recessed before the May 29-June 2 summit between <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, which produced only slight progress toward a long-range nuclear forces treaty. The superpower leaders then ordered negotiators to continue `` energetically and purposefully.'' No end date has been announced for this new round. The chief negotiators hinted that a breakthrough is not in sight. `` Do n't look for drama,'' <PERSON> Kampelman </PERSON> told reporters Monday. `` We're at a stage now where hard work is required rather than drama.'' <PERSON> Obukhov </PERSON> warned after his arrival Sunday: `` We do not want to lose momentum.'' While both negotiators said the talks have come `` a long way,'' <PERSON> Kampelman </PERSON> also noted, `` Much that is important still remains to be solved.'' He said a draft could still be completed under the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and voiced hope the new round will, `` at the very least, significantly narrow the differences between us.'' Both sides agree that the proposed Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty should cut each side's stocks over seven years to an overall limit of 6,000 nuclear warheads and 1,600 launchers, such as heavy bombers and land-based intercontinental missiles. Some details of monitoring compliance with a future pact are also settled, but both negotiators stressed more work was needed. <PERSON> Obukhov </PERSON> told reporters progress `` now depends primarily'' on resolving disputes over <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plans to develop a space-based missile defense system, called the Strategic Defense Initiative, and on limiting the deployment of long-range sea-launched cruise missiles. `` We reject the Soviet attempts to use these negotiations to have us end our Strategic Defense Initiative,'' <PERSON> Kampelman </PERSON> said. For sea-launched cruise missiles, the Soviets have proposed limits and called for anti-cheating measures including inspections of warships. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has balked, saying the weapons can not be reliably detected. On Monday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiator <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanmer </PERSON> called the Soviet verification proposals `` totally impractical'' and said current prospects for resolving the issue are dim. Last December, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> signed a treaty scrapping all intermediate-range nuclear forces. Both countries ratified that pact shortly before the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit.

 The pilot of the helicopter that plucked three convicts out of a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> prison flew the same aircraft in the movie `` Rambo III,'' a friend says. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bella </PERSON>, 43, of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, who told authorities his <ORGANIZATION> Aerospatiale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazelle </ORGANIZATION> was hijacked before Monday's failed escape attempt, would not have voluntarily helped the inmates, said <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Mobley </PERSON>. `` Anybody who knows him knows how hard he works,'' said <PERSON> Mobley </PERSON>, who has known <PERSON> Bella </PERSON> 16 years. `` No one would believe he would risk everything he's worked for for someone who got theirs the easy way. I would stake my life on it.'' Two inmates were captured during a nearly two-hour chase that followed the escape, and the third was apprehended early today, authorities said. Police also arrested a woman who was in the aircraft when it landed in a yard at the Penitentiary of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bella </PERSON> told his wife, <PERSON> Carrol </PERSON>, that the woman forced him to fly to the prison by putting a gun to his head and handcuffing him to the control stick. <PERSON> Bella </PERSON> was being held at the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Jail while authorities checked his story, officials said.

<TEXT>
 Two black families have become the first black tenants in 10 years at a public housing project in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, the scene of racial violence when public schools were integrated in the 1970s. The families moved Monday into the <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON> housing project and were greeted by <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>, wife of Mayor <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>. Police kept bystanders and reporters at a distance during the move, which took place without incident. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinkscales </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bessie </PERSON> <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> and their families stayed in their apartments Monday and would not comment. Ms. <PERSON> Clinkscales </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Payne </PERSON>, both 36, met with reporters on Saturday and expressed a desire to begin a stable life in their apartments. `` It will take some courage to do it but I'm just doing it because I'm a decent human being that needs to live somewhere,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Clinkscales </PERSON>, who lives with her 19-year-old daughter and 4-year-old grandson. `` I'm no pioneer,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Payne </PERSON>. `` I'm just almost a homeless person _ and I do n't like that feeling at all. I'm looking forward to making a new home and getting my life straightened out again.'' Ms. <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> has a 13-year-old son and 8-year-old daughter. The families were given three-bedroom apartments by the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> after they were evicted from other apartments. Their move is not part of an ongoing integration plan affecting 31 of 69 public housing projects, including the 1,000-tenant <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON>. The plan by <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> seeks to provide subsidized housing for an estimated 500 black families passed over for placement in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Charlestown </LOCATION> projects since 1983.

 A man convicted of masterminding a fake plane crash during a heavy snowstorm has been sentenced to one year in a federal prison and ordered to undergo psychiatric evaluation. The sentence given Monday to <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> `` sends a strong message that it's a serious crime to cry wolf,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiebusch </PERSON>. The radio report sparked a search last Jan. 8 that cost $ 50,000 and involved as many as 100 people, 20 aircraft and six police agencies. They looked for a downed jet with three dead passengers and a badly injured pilot. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Circuit Judge <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Bownes </PERSON> said `` more than minimal planning was involved'' in faking the crash during the storm, in which visibility was one-half mile, temperatures were in the teens and nine inches of snow fell. <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> `` must have known that -LRB- the fake report -RRB- would set off a massive ground and air search,'' <PERSON> Bownes </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Blair </PERSON>, 29, was convicted in May of making a false report to the government, a crime punishable by a fine and up to five years' prison Although <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> said he was not surprised by the sentence, he insisted he is innocent and will appeal. <PERSON> Bownes </PERSON> declined to set bail for <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> pending appeal. At the trial, <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> testified that he could n't have committed the hoax because he was asleep and was n't aware a plane had been reported down. But one of his neighbors testified that he heard the sound of a two-way radio through <PERSON> Blair </PERSON>'s window and a voice crying out for help. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> reservist and <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> pilot, testified that he and his crew tracked the voice of a man who talked sporadically and said that he was loosing blood, was chilled and weak, and that at least one person in his plane was dead. <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>, 39, testified that his crew was overcome with emotion when the man said he heard the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> plane overhead. `` People in my plane were screaming and yelling ... I got tears in my eyes thinking, ` We're going to get this guy out,''' <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bownes </PERSON> recommended that <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> be jailed at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Butner </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, a prison with extensive psychiatric facilities. <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> also was sentenced to two years' probation, during which he will be required to receive mental health counseling.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s decision to pay families of the 290 people killed in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> downing of an Iranian airliner met fresh resistance on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> today, with some lawmakers saying the gesture is premature and politically touchy. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is not guilty of anything'' except protecting the lives of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> sailors, Rep. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' show. He contended that the Iranian government deliberately provoked the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cruiser <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> into firing on the jetliner and said, `` I do n't think there's any question this was a provoked attack. ... `` It was an act of martyrdom by the Iranian government to bring humiliation on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and we should not be a part of that at this time,'' <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> said. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, R-Ariz., concurred `` It's too early. There are many serious questions that need to be resolved ... before we would contemplate compensation. We should also expect some progress on the hostage situation,'' he said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America.'' `` I do n't see why there's this rush to judgment.'' Their comments echoed those of other members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who said after Monday's announcement that the distinction may be largely lost on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> electorate, which harbors long-simmering resentment of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> stemming from the seizure of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy in 1979, from its sponsorship of international terrorism and from the continued holding of Americans in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s request `` has some problems,'' added Rep. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif., the chief <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vote counter in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, who said he personally opposed the idea `` I do n't understand why they're trying to move it along. But Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-R.I. </LOCATION>, appearing with <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>, responded that compensating the families of those who died is `` the fair and the just and the right thing to do ... we're not admitting any guilt.'' Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, D-Conn., also appearing on `` Good Morning America,'' said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s offer `` distinguishes us from others ... It's the sign of a compassionate and strong nation.'' The disagreement spread even to two former hostages in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, who appeared on <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Morning.'' <PERSON> Morehead </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> suggested forming a mixed claims commission to handle <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> claims against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> as well as that nation's claims against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Such a procedure would establish a connection with the nine Americans held hostage in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, he suggested. `` I do n't think that we should go this guilt trip by ourselves,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. `` There is a very culpable Iranian guilt here.'' Another victim of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> takeover in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Laingen </PERSON>, said however that he agrees with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` This is a clear case where we have a humanitarian obligation to offer compensation to the victims,'' he said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, said in Monday's announcement that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was motivated by humanitarian concerns and was acting out of charity rather than obligation He made it clear that payments were to go to victims' families and not to the <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> government of <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>. A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> investigative team is still looking into the incident, in which the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> fired on the airliner after mistaking it for a warplane. Numerous questions about <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s decision remained unanswered, including how much money would be paid to the families, how contact would be made in the absence of formal diplomatic relations between the two countries and just what legal authority would be used to make the payments. A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, briefing reporters on condition of anonymity, said it is not clear whether a flat amount will be paid for each victim or whether the age, number of dependents and earnings of the victims will be taken into account in assessing compensation. It also was unclear whether the gesture would require congressional legislation. <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> leaders assumed that the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would seek <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approval out of a desire for support for its policy decision, if not out of a need for money to pay the families. House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said offering payments to the survivors of the victims would be `` a voluntary act committed by a nation that is both generous and genuinely regretful'' of the incident. He said he expected quick action once <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> formally makes a request of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` If the president is satisfied -LRB- that payments are warranted -RRB-, I would imagine the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would be satisfied,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. Leading members of the congressional foreign policy and defense committees also have spoken out in favor of making such payments. `` We are a just and generous people,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>, R-Pa., who said the payments should go forward `` on basic grounds of fairness and decency. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the money would be channeled through some third-party organization or intermediary, such as the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crescent </ORGANIZATION>, an arm of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. He acknowledged that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> still has not determined how to verify the identities of the dead or survivors who will likely make compensation claims. All but 38 of the <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> passengers were from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The others were from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>. A national <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll last week found that 61 percent of those surveyed opposed the idea of paying compensation. That finding appeared to take on substantial weight just four months before congressional elections. Some lawmakers linked the payment issue with the question of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostages who continue to be held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, apparently by radical elements with ties to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> said the hostages should be freed as part of any compensation deal. But <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said that would amount to ransoming them, and <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> added: `` I do n't think there are very many congressmen who want it to appear we're doing business with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> over the hostages.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the payments would be what lawyers call `` ex gratia'' _ made voluntarily without admitting guilt or liability. Under international law, nations have no legal liability for damages caused as a result of war or hostilities. But some administration advisers have been concerned that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> not be likened to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which refused to make compensation after shooting down a <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> passenger plane over the Sea of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in 1983, according to congressional sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.

 Iraqi forces today pushed <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s army out of the last major pockets of <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> territory it held along the southern border, the official Iraqi radio said. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said its warplanes bombed Iraqi positions in the southern Zubaidat region of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, but did not say the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> forces had regained control of the area. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> also announced its forces were pulling back from positions in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s northern mountains. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s presidential guards spearheaded the offensive to retake a chunk of land in the Zubaidat region along the border with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, according to war communiques broadcast by Iraqi radio. The offensive began just after dawn and the <LOCATION> Zubaidat </LOCATION> area ... ... five missions over the Zubaidat region. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> also said Iranian troops had retreated from the town of <LOCATION> Halabja </LOCATION> in northeastern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to new `` defensive positions.'' The retreat was designed to `` ma more secure approaches,'' the ... In <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, there was no official confirmation of an assault on <LOCATION> Halabja </LOCATION>, but military sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said an attack has been expected for weeks. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> seized <LOCATION> Halabja </LOCATION>, in the Kurdish area of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, last March. It later accused <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> of unleashing a chemical weapons offensive against the town, killing 5,000 people. Iraqi communiques concentrated on the retaking of the Zubaidat region, which fell to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> several years ago. Neither country confirmed how much territory <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> held in the area. The communiques said an unspecified number of Iranians were either killed or wounded in today's battle east of <LOCATION> Amara </LOCATION>, which is 180 miles southeast of the Iraqi capital of <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. It is the latest in a series of battlefield defeats for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> since the Iraqis took back the <ORGANIZATION> Faw </ORGANIZATION> peninsula on April 18. The communique announcing that the Zubaidat area had been recaptured was widely believed written by President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>. He has written them in the past and the phrasing in today's latest report mirrored his style. It reiterated <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s readiness to end the war under terms of a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s Resolution 598. The resolution calls for an immediate cease-fire and an independent inquiry into which side started the 8-year-old war.

 A cystic fibrosis victim who became the nation's first living heart donor has died of respiratory failure, 14 months after receiving a heart and lungs transplant at <LOCATION> Johns </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hopkins </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> <PERSON> House </PERSON>, 29, who donated his heart to another man after he received a heart-lung transplant, died while awaiting a second transplant, his cardiologist, Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Traill </PERSON>, said Monday.

Meanwhile, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Couch </PERSON>, 39, of <PERSON> Yardley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, who received <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s original heart, continues to do well, <PERSON> Traill </PERSON> said Couch had suffered from congestive heart failure. House received the heart and lungs of a brain-dead accident victim in a 17-hour operation on May 10-11, 1987. He needed a lung transplant, but doctors did a heart-lung transplant because the procedure is safer. House donated his healthy heart to Couch in the nation's first so-called domino donor transplant, hospital spokesman <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kibak </PERSON> said. House `` had a good summer last year, a good fall,'' said <PERSON> Traill </PERSON>. `` But from about that onwards, he began to do progessively less well because of the system rejection.'' House had been waiting since February for a second double transplant, <PERSON> Traill </PERSON> said. Couch `` was sad and distressed,'' by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s death, said <PERSON> Traill </PERSON>. `` It did n't come as a complete surprise to -LRB- Couch -RRB-, because he knew Mr. <PERSON> House </PERSON> had been doing poorly. They had been keeping in touch.'' Cystic fibrosis causes production of a thick, sticky mucus that clogs the lungs and digestive system. It is the nation's most common inherited disease, afflicting about 30,000 Americans, and usually kills victims by the time they reach their mid-20s.

 <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said today it will begin marketing VHS-format video cassette recorders in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this fall.

 Under a state law custom-written for <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> in 1959, Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> could run for re-election to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and for vice president at the same time. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who was <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s running mate, won both races in 1960 and later became the first president from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.

That was until <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> decided to campar the vice presidential nomination, to arrange a grand arrival in this convention city and encourage a few thousand of his closest friends to join him and deign arduously foride the proposed bare-bones platform crafted by the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> forces. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was asked a few days ago whether he was worried about stealing some of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' thunder. `` It has nothing to do with thunder,'' was his taunting reply. `` Mr. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had no intention of bringing any thunder to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> today stole some of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s thunder. According a well-placed <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> source, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will announce later today that he has selected Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> BWe intend to have an effective, informative convention that would inspire our nation, unify our party and take us to victory,'' he said Monday. But he also said that his actions in the future will be influenced by the treatment his candidacy and platform proposals receive. `` The conclusion of those steps will in some measure determine what our fall activities will be,'' he said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has an uncanny ability to remain on the stage long after other politicians would have departed. He remained a campaigner in the primary season long after a conventional politician would have run out of money and called it quits. He campaigned assiduously for the vice presidential nomination, while others who want it as much or more practically blush anytime the subject is mentioned within their earshot. Who else in American politics would announce one day that he had decided whether he would accept an offer to join <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on the ticket, but would n't tell anyone what his decision was And who else would describe as `` unknown quantities'' all the other contenders for the vice presidential nomination? His platform issues will be debated on national television next week if it goes that far. He will speak during prime time on the second night of the convention. His name will be entered into nomination for president the following night. And it is conceivable that his name could be put into nomination for vice president on the final night in a final, symbolic clash with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. That, of course, would give him the chance to go to the podium once more, perhaps to bestow his blessing at last on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his running mate. But even now, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is making sure the spotlight does n't turn away from him when the convention ends. He declared on Monday _ before the choice of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> became known _ that if <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> offered him second place on the ticket `` I would accept it.'' He said he assured <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' emissary <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> that he would be a loyal vice president. But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said that if he were not chosen, he would expect further discussions with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> before defining what role he will play in the fall campaign.

 <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> today promised `` appropriate action,'' including contract suspensions, if the ongoing Pentagon bribery probe turns up new evidence that some contracts may be tainted. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said he lifted his July 1 suspensions of nine military programs because a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> review `` did not indicate that any of the current contracts in the affected programs are tainted.'' The Pentagon is beginning actions to ban two companies and three individuals from doing further business with the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that `` if other official information becomes available during the course of the investigation which warrants new concern regarding these or other contracts, the department will evaluate it and take any appropriate action.'' He outlined actions the Pentagon may take, including rescinding, terminating or suspending contracts, or fining individuals. The decisions arose from the criminal investigation of allegations that defense contractors and consultants bribed <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials for contracting details that could be vital in winning contracts worth billions of dollars. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> also said he is writing to the chief executives of the top 200 defense contractors, `` urging them to ensure stringent management controls on the use of consultants and to avoid improper business practices.'' The acquisition system has problems, <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> admitted. `` There are defects in how <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> equips its forces,'' he said. The current investigation is a good reason to correct those flaws, he said. `` Even if the probe reveals no more than the misdeeds of a few greedy lawbreakers, I still want to move forward now, in cooperation with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, to remedy flaws in our system, regardless of whether those flaws are related to the Justice investigation.'' The companies suspended Monday were <ORGANIZATION> Varian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Acquisition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. The three individuals were former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> procurement officer <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON>, consultant <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Muldoon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Varian </PERSON> official <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>'s July 1 announcement of contract suspensions had come in the wake of congressional calls for strong action. But the suspensions were surrounded by confusion from the beginning, with <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials unable to say exactly what work was covered and when the actions took effect. Contractors, meanwhile, said they were not formally notified so they continued to work on the contracts. The contracts were with <ORGANIZATION> Litton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> ITT </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Loral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Terracom </ORGANIZATION>, Canadian Commercial, <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Raytheon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowsher </PERSON>, head of the congressional <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Monday that quick actions should not be undertaken while the criminal investigation is under way `` It might be better to let the investigative process work,'' said <PERSON> Bowsher </PERSON>. Later, he said, if there are indictments, contracts could be suspended. Should there be convictions, companies and individuals could then be barred from doing business, he said. All three men suspended Monday from doing <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> business have been identified in <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> affidavits as having allegedly traded in inside contract information. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> procurement officer who was convicted of stock trading on insider <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> information in 1982, was receiving inside contract data from <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, his <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> successor. The bureau said it `` believes that <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON> is paying Stone for this information.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has begun actions to suspend Stone without pay, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> is vice president for marketing of <ORGANIZATION> Varian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>; he has been placed on administrative leave. <PERSON> Muldoon </PERSON> is a former <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> employee who set up his own consulting firm in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. An <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> affidavit said <PERSON> Muldoon </PERSON> paid <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON> $ 4,000 out of an $ 8,000 monthly retainer from <ORGANIZATION> Litton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> in exchange for contract information. In his congressional testimony, <PERSON> Bowsher </PERSON> noted that past defense buildups, during World War II and the Korean War, were also tarnished by procurement problems. `` History shows that when too much money is pumped into the acquisition system over a relatively short period of time, we will have problems,'' he said. But in contrast to past cases, which generally involved lower-level people, `` one thing that distinguishes -LRB- this case -RRB- is it's fairly high up,'' <PERSON> Bowsher </PERSON> said. `` The thing that discourages me the most is that some very senior people might be involved,'' he said. Besides the possible criminal charges, said <PERSON> Bowsher </PERSON>, another problem is likely to arise from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration military buildup. `` I think the other shoe will probably fall soon, namely, many big cost overruns,'' he told the committee. `` I suspect the Stealth airplane program, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> shipbuilding programs and the other programs which have to be stretched because of budget constraints will all result in very large cost increases that the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will have to finance,'' he said. `` Stretch out'' refers to a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> practice, adopted when budgets are tight, of buying the same number of weapons but doing it over a longer period. Intervening price hikes frequently end up increasing the overall cost.

<HEAD>Bylines Withheld at Post to Protest Lack of Contract</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Reporters, artists, photographers and columnists for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> withheld their bylines from today's editions of the newspaper to protest the two years they have gone without a labor contract with the company. The last contract between Post management and the <ORGANIZATION> Washington-Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> expired July 9, 1986. In a flier distributed in the newsroom, <PERSON> Lew </PERSON> <PERSON> Diuguid </PERSON>, head of the bargaining committee of the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> unit of the union, accused the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> of `` failure to bargain in good faith.'' The guild said it planned a two-day byline strike. Union leaders say there is a two-tier pay system which established a lower minimum scale for those hired after 1976, causing what they say is pay discrimination by race and sex. The union also opposes what it says is a `` pattern of force-outs of ` expensive' senior employees.'' In a statement, Executive Editor <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradlee </PERSON> and Managing Editor <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Downie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said, `` We all want a new contract between the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> and the guild'' and that the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> `` has now signed contracts with every one of the other 10 unions'' represented at the newspaper. The statement denied existence of a two-tier wage system and said the Post is not trying to force out higher paid employees. The last negotiated contract between the Guild and the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> established a top minimum pay rate of $ 664.35 a week. <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Polaski </PERSON>, administrator for the guild, said that under company-imposed rules pay has been raised, leaving an average $ 240-a-week gap between white males, who are at the high end of the scale, and black females, at the low end. She said that even when black women and white men with the same experience and time at the newspaper are compared, an average $ 170-a-week pay discrepancy exists. The guild is filing a class action complaint this week with the <ORGANIZATION> D.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> asking for an investigation of differences in pay, hiring, promotion and discharge based on sex, race, national origin and age, <PERSON> Polaski </PERSON> said.

 A white construction worker was arrested on assault and other charges after he allegedly attacked a black corrections officer taking pictures with his girlfriend on a beach, authorities said. The corrections officer, 27-year-old <PERSON> Neville </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonitto </PERSON>, was clubbed with a steel pipe by the man as a group of whites jeered, `` You do n't belong here,'' police said. <PERSON> Bonitto </PERSON> suffered cuts and bruises to his right knee, right shoulder and elbow, said Detective <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Stray </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Park Police on Monday. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Guglielmo </PERSON>, 21, was charged with felony assault, aggravated harassment and criminal possession of a deadly weapon. Officials said more arrests were expected. The incident took place Sunday evening at a beach in the <ORGANIZATION> Gateway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recreation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> where <PERSON> Bonitto </PERSON>, his girlfriend _ model <PERSON> Jewel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gittens </PERSON>, 25 _ and another couple, all of them black, were taking pictures in a gazebo. The pictures were to be used for Ms. <PERSON> Gittens </PERSON>' professional portfolio. The group had a permit to be on the beach, which is only open to permit holders, said Stray. While the group took pictures, <PERSON> Guglielmo </PERSON> and a 17-year-old companion began screaming racial slurs and threatened to release a Doberman pinscher to attack them, <PERSON> Stray </PERSON> said. `` They were yelling ` You do n't belong here, you do n't belong in the park here,' but they -LRB- the blacks -RRB- ignored them,'' said Capt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> of the city police Bias Unit. The two white men entered the gazebo, brushed against the blacks and urinated on a wall about 10 feet away, <PERSON> Stray </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bonitto </PERSON> identified himself as a corrections officer and asked them to leave. The two men refused and spilled beer on Ms. <PERSON> Gittens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Guglielmo </PERSON> began scuffling with <PERSON> Bonitto </PERSON> and allegedly clubbed him with the steel pipe, <PERSON> Stray </PERSON> said. During the scuffle, eight other white men and women came over to aid the two whites. <PERSON> Bonitto </PERSON> pulled out his shield and service revolver and again identified himself as a law enforcement officer, but the whites continued to jeer. The corrections officer ran to a nearby firehouse, where he called police. The crowd was still yelling racial slurs when <PERSON> Bonitto </PERSON> returned with officers and identified <PERSON> Guglielmo </PERSON> as his attacker, police said.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s selection of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> as his next attorney general marks a return for the tough-minded former <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> governor to the law enforcement roots that first propelled him into the public eye in 1969. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said today that he had chosen <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> to replace <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, who announced last week that he would resign by early August. Former members of <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s gubernatorial administration were quick to point out his reputation for integrity and that he eliminated the corruption that tainted the tenure of his predecessor, Democrat <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapp </PERSON>. They also noted the close ties <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> has kept with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. As governor, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, 55, frequently testified on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> on behalf of the president's proposal for line-item veto power and a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. He has turned down offers to head the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, and was considered for the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> post in 1985. As governor, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said his budget proposals held spending increases to less than the rate of inflation for eight straight years. He championed a controversial welfare reform law that limited cash benefits to three months a year for an estimated 68,000 people considered `` able-bodied.'' But it was his abilities as a prosecutor that first won him headlines. He was appointed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney for western <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> in 1969. His attacks on organized crime, drug trafficking and pornography led to his being appointed assistant attorney general in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s criminal division by President <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> in 1975. `` In fact, for the first few hours of <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s administration, he was the highest-ranking person at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Gwen </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, who left a post as head of <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office to become a deputy assistant at the White House `` He's certainly someone whose integrity is beyond question,'' she said before his appointment was confirmed. `` He could bring stability and integrity to the position without any doubt, and frankly, I think the administration would be well-served to ask him.'' Democratic critics said <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> lacked compassion, and were fond of reciting a story of a poor women who began badgering the governor during a campaign swing in <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in 1982. `` Things are tough all over,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> told the woman. But his supporters describe <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> as methodical and cool under pressure. `` All of us who worked for him always viewed him as a person who weighed things so carefully and was so methodical and precise that he would be perfect as attorney general,'' said <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> secretary of community affairs under <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> who now heads the <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>. Barred by law from seeking a third term as governor, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> at the end of 1986 to head the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Politics </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION>. But he hardly retreated from the public eye. Rather, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> was busier than ever on the political circuit back home, leading observers to believe his stint at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> may have only been a break between campaigns of one sort or another. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> has been said to be considering running for governor again when Democrat <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> comes up for re-election in 1990. He also had been mentioned as a possible running mate for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` He's a politician,'' his longtime aide <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` He has not closed the door on another campaign for something.'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s recent activity has included two fund-raisers that have netted about $ 100,000 for the `` Governor <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> <PERSON> Committee </PERSON>,'' an account he uses to support his travels on behalf of other candidates, <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. In addition, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> is co-chairman of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s `` Victory'88,'' a federal fund that distributes money for phone banks and other <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> campaign efforts The possibility of a Bush-Thornburgh ticket excited <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s Republican convention delegates, many of whom named the former governor as their top choice for the second spot on the ticket. In 1960, an automobile accident killed <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s wife and left his youngest son brain-damaged. He was married again in 1963 to schoolteacher <PERSON> Ginny </PERSON> <PERSON> Judson </PERSON>.

 As the 1988 Democratic vice presidential candidate, Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> will share an attribute with many candidates for the the second spot: At the moment of his selection, he is largely unknown to the American public. Few recent polls have sought to gauge the impact of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> on the ticket, in part because pollsters gauged his chance of selection as low and in part because so many potential voters have no opinion of him. In a national Gallup poll in mid-May, 77 percent of respondents said they had not heard enough about <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> to say what they thought of him. The margin of error for the remainder was very high, about 8 percentage points. Of those few with an opinion, 3 percent said they had a very favorable view of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, 12 percent mostly favorable, 6 percent mostly unfavorable and 2 percent very unfavorable. Gallup computed a `` ticket strengthening index'' in that poll to gauge the help a vice presidential candidate could bring his ticket. New Jersey Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> rated highest; <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was near the bottom. However, that measure was limited by the number of people with an opinion of each potential candidate, and in <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s case that was low. `` There are many other vice presidential possibilties that are more popular than <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. Basically the guy just does not have much name recognition on a national scale,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugick </PERSON>, a Gallup pollster. <PERSON> Hugick </PERSON> noted that Gallup just completed a poll during the weekend that tested two possibile <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> running mates _ <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. `` We picked the wrong Southerner,'' he said. In an <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> poll last month, 60 percent said the vice president candidate was very important to their choice of a ticket. But <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was not among the five possible Democratic running-mates tested. A <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll in May tested <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as possible running mates, but again, not <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON>, pollster for <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, said he also has not tested <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> as a candidate for vice president. `` It would remain to be seen based on his performance and how <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> utilizes his new choice here how much he helps,'' <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> said. `` He's well known in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Presumably it helps there. In the rest of the country it remains to be seen how well he'll play, because he is not known by a vast majority of the country at all.'' <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> noted, however, that many other candidates for vice president, and even for president, start as relative unknowns. In a CBS-Times poll in November, for example, 77 percent of respondents had no opinion of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Ex-Navy Photographer Says Crash Photos Sealed To Avoid Publicity</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> photographer said he was transferred from the <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angels </ORGANIZATION> after he entered photographs of a fatal collision between two jets from the flight demonstration squadron in a photo contest. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> said the photographs were pulled from the contest because they were embarrassing to the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angels </ORGANIZATION>' spokesman Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Hocking </PERSON>, however, said <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> was made available for transfer and the photographs were removed because of their graphic content and his failure to obtain authorization before entering them. The pictures shoed a 1985 collision during an air show over <LOCATION> Niagara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>. One pilot was killed and the other pilot parachuted to safety after the collision, and an investigation blamed pilot error <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> entered the photographs in the 1986 Military Photographer of the Year contest. Two photos of the crash by <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> were published Monday in the <ORGANIZATION> Pensacola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, which said it received the photos anonymously. The <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angels </ORGANIZATION> are based at the <ORGANIZATION> Pensacola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>, now a civilian free-lance photographer reportedly living in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, said he was scheduled for transfer to security guard school on the remote island of <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> but managed to get sent instead to <LOCATION> Lakehurst </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, and continue in photography until his release. <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angels </ORGANIZATION> commanding officer Cmdr. <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> <PERSON> Rud </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> of failing to turn the photos over for use by investigators immediately after the accident and lying when he claimed the film had been lost until after the probe was concluded. <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> said he found the film four months after the crash. Before <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> left, the <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angels </ORGANIZATION> ordered him to turn over all copies and negatives of the crash photos, but his boss in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> found a set of the crash pictures in <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>'s portfolio. <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> said he was reduced in rank as a result.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, looking to protect the interests of 30 million veterans and their dependents, today overwhelmingly approved legislation creating a Cabinet-level Department of Veterans Affairs. The bill was approved 84-11. Negotiators will work out technical differences between the bill and a version the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed last November, just a week after it was recommended by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The secretary of veterans' affairs would be the 14th Cabinet secretary and the fifth added since 1960. Voting against elevating the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to Cabinet level were Sens. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, R-Colo.; <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, R-Wash.; <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Garn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON>, R-Kan.; <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Idaho </LOCATION>; <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, D-Wis.; <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>; <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wyo </LOCATION>., and <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Symms </PERSON>, R-Idaho Not voting were Sens. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, D-Del.; <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Trible </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>. `` For the first time, the Veterans Administration will have direct access to the president without an intervening party,'' Spark <PERSON> Matsunaga </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>, said Monday as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> debated the measure. `` For the first time, the secretary of veterans' affairs will sit in the highest policy councils of the land.'' Earlier in the day, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> agreed to allow veterans to appeal to the courts when their claims for benefits are denied by VA.. That measure also would repeal a provision, enacted at the end of the Civil War, that prohibits lawyers from charging more than $ 10 to press a claim for a veteran This bill, approved on an 86-11 vote, has failed four times in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in recent years, apparently because of fears that lawyers would replace the voluntary organizations, including <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legion </ORGANIZATION> and Veterans of Foreign Wars, in dealing with VA. Nevertheless, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., said, `` I think this time we have enough momentum to get this measure approved by the full <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> concluded that elevation of <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> `` would best serve <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s veterans, the American public and, ultimately, the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> through strengthening of the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> as a policymaking mechanism. <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, a former chairman of the committee, said he sees no rational reason for the bill. `` If anybody believes veterans need a stronger voice ... than they already have, then I've missed something in the nine years I've been here.'' The changes would take effect Jan. 1. Republicans sought to allow <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to name the first secretary immediately, even though there would be no department to preside over this year. That proposal was defeated. VA, created in 1930, has the third largest work force in the federal government, exceeded only by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. It has a $ 28 billion annual budget and 240,000 employees, administers almost 90,000 patient beds in 534 health facilities and last year had 20 million outpatient visits. The <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> estimates raising the VA status will cost $ 33 million over five years. In giving veterans limited access to the courts to appeal claims cases, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rejected by a 61-36 margin a far more restrictive amendment by Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Murkowski </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, senior Republican on the Veterans' Affairs Committee. It would have allowed review only of VA regulations, not of the agency's factual findings about an individual veteran's claim. The Senate-passed bill would permit a court to overturn an adverse finding of fact by the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> when the court finds the decision `` so utterly lacking in a rational basis in the evidence that a manifest and grievous injustice would result if such finding were not set aside.'' <PERSON> Murkowski </PERSON> argued against the change, saying the current system works adequately. `` Does anyone, anywhere have evidence that the system is so broken that without federal court intervention in thousands of individual claims our veterans are going to be deprived of a fair shake?'' he asked. He cited statistics that the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> reverses up to 25 percent of claim denials and said the bill would add about 4,500 cases a year to the nation's backlogged courts

 Many hungry New Yorkers scanned the streets in vain for hot dogs, shish kebabs and ice cream as Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> began enforcing a 5-year-old ban on food vendors on crowded city sidewalks. A special police unit took to the streets Monday to see that licensed vendors follow the ordinance, which limits the time and location that food pushcarts may operate. But many peddlers had already pulled their stands off the sidewalks in protest, and said they planned to demonstrate at City Hall. `` Demonstrations will have no impact on us. None at all!'' said the mayor. `` I would n't care if they came with 20,000 stands -LRB- to City Hall -RRB-. It will have no impact.'' Police said they confiscated four of the polished metal pushcarts with colorful umbrellas during the first day of the peddler patrol. But some 600 carts disappeared from the streets as a small group of vendors gathered across from Radio City Music Hall to protest. `` It means I've got two kids and I'm out of work now. And the mayor does n't give a damn,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Michaelides </PERSON>, who's been hawking hot dogs for 25 years, like his father before him. Those looking for a cheap lunch found themselves going hungry or paying more than they'd like. `` I ca n't afford a $ 4 sandwich,'' said <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Faraci </PERSON>, 36, an office worker. `` But I can afford a $ 1 hot dog.'' She sat without a meal near Rockefeller Center, sipping the soda she had purchased to drink with her lunch. The mayor admitted the crackdown was a bit of political arm-twisting to get the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to pass a new law that would allow six vendors, chosen by lottery, to work each prime street block. But the vendors and <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> members have balked at the plan, resulting in <LOCATION> Koch </LOCATION>'s edict to begin enforcing the 1983 law, which bans vendors from corners in midtown, including <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and Times Square, in the Wall Street area, near the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mall </LOCATION>. A spokeswoman for the City Council, <PERSON> Peg </PERSON> <PERSON> Breen </PERSON>, said the sweep was `` overreacting.'' She said current law, prudently enforced, could reduce sidewalk overcrowding. The <ORGANIZATION> M. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parpis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Distribution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns 50 vending carts, found little help in court to fight the ban. <PERSON> Parpis </PERSON>' lawyers argued in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> that the ban is an unreasonable use of the city's regulatory power. But Justice <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirschenbaum </PERSON> said Monday the city was within its legal rights. Five hours later, Justice <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberger </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Appellate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> denied a similar request by <PERSON> Parpis </PERSON>. Interspersed among the picketing vendors were a dozen red-bereted <ORGANIZATION> Guardian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angels </ORGANIZATION>, whose leader, <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sliwa </PERSON>, vowed the group would try to physically block the city from confiscating any carts. `` As you are carting away their carts and taking the vendors away in handcuffs, crack dealers are operating with impunity on the same block,'' said <PERSON> Sliwa </PERSON>. Vendors whose carts are confiscated face up to a $ 1,000 fine. Recovering the carts will cost $ 65 plus a $ 5-a-day storage fee.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> undoubtedly hopes the selection of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> to be his vice presidential running mate will rekindle warm memories of 1960 and become an example of history repeating itself. But <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did n't make this choice on nostalgia alone. Geography, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> experience and a relatively conservative voting record pointed the way to <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> _ a fellow who has already defeated <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> once. Beyond helping in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s choice is designed to reassure the white male voters across the South who have abandoned the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in droves in recent elections, and to win over the voters who shunned <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in many of the primaries across the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> on Super Tuesday last March. The history <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> hopes to repeat is <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s choice of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a decision that enabled the Democratic ticket to carry <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and claim the White House in one of the closest elections of modern times. In many ways, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> is a political model and a hero for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who delights in recalling how he and close friend <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> once traveled across country in a battered car to see the son of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> nominated for president in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> 28 years ago. Now, more than a quarter century later, another son of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> is the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s leader, and longtime sidekick <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> shepherded the selection of a partner for the fall campaign. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s brother, Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, quickly embraced the selection of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, saying today, `` The Massachusetts-Texas combination got this country moving again in 1960, and it will do the same for the nation in 1988.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s top campaign aides speak hopefully of a virtual lock on Southern electoral votes, putting 200 to 220 such votes within the vice president's grasp with relative ease. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> accounts for 29 of those votes, and no Democrat in this century has won the White House without carrying the state. `` This will make <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> a real battleground,'' said one <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign strategist, and indeed it should. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> defeated <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the state in a 1970 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> race, and will be on the ballot twice this year. Under a special law passed for <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> in 1960, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> can seek re-election to his seat as well as run for vice president. So while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> may yet win the South, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s selection means it wo n't be easy. And the more time <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is forced to spend in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> defending his natural political base, the less time he has to challenge <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, states shaping up as the critical tests in the battle for the White House. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, of course, has the luxury of going second in the vice presidential selection game. He may now choose to maximize his chances in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, or pick a candidate from one of the industrial state battlegrounds, thus checking <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' move. He could also stake out new territory, by choosing a woman for example. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also balanced the ticket in another way when he selected <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. He has been urged repeatedly to select someone who has experience in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is the walking embodiment of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> establishment. He is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, a one-time head of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senatorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and widely respected by his peers. But <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is no clone of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, just as <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> was no clone of <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION>. He has voted in favor of funding for the Contra rebels battling the government of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, and his record on civil rights will come under scrutiny from the liberals whose support also will be needed for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to win the White House. An early test will come on Wednesday, when <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is expected to join <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in an appearance before the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Irish troops of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> were caught in the crossfire today in a battle between Israeli-backed militiamen and <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> Moslem guerrillas, security sources said. The sources said they had no immediate word of militia or civilian casualties because the fighting was too intense around the village of <LOCATION> Braachit </LOCATION> to allow <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> teams to enter. <PERSON> Timur </PERSON> <PERSON> Goksel </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, said units of the Irish battalion manning several positions in <LOCATION> Braachit </LOCATION>, 15 miles southeast of Tyre, were pinned down in the fighting. But no casualties were reported among <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> troops. <PERSON> Goksel </PERSON> said the fighting broke out at 1 p.m. when `` unknown elements'' fired two rocket-propelled grenades at a hilltop position manned by the Israeli-backed <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Braachit </LOCATION>. The Israeli-allied <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which man's <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-designated security zone along the border, has come under repeated attack by Moslem guerrillas <PERSON> Goksel </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> tanks fired 90 rounds into the village, which lies on the northern edge of the Israeli security zone. The sources said five artillery or tank shells a minute were hitting the village, which has a population of 3,000. The sources said two Israeli Cobra helicopter gunships later attacked the village with machine gun fire. An Irish officer in <LOCATION> Braachit </LOCATION>, reached by telephone, said `` most of the village has been destroyed.'' The security sources said <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> teams made two attempts to enter the village to bring out casualties, but were driven back by gunfire. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> established the security zone in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> after it withdrew the bulk of its forces from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1985. The Israelis had invaded <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> three years earlier.

 The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> prevented a top officer of an international police organization from entering the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because he was believed to be a spy who helped <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> gain access to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence information, the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today. <PERSON> Zhu </PERSON> <PERSON> Entao </PERSON>, a vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Interpol </ORGANIZATION>, was to have attended the group's executive committee meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last week, but was refused a visa to enter the country, the newspaper said. Authorities believe <PERSON> Zhu </PERSON> played a key role in gathering information from <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wu-Tai </PERSON> <PERSON> Chin </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> translator. Chin committed suicide two years ago after being convicted of selling classified information to the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> government. Over a long period, <PERSON> Chin </PERSON> allegedly turned over volumes of top-secret documents revealing the West's assessment of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s strategic, military, economic and scientific capabilites The Chin case was considered one of the most severe breaches in American intelligence security in recent years. <PERSON> Chiwei </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON>, press officer for the People's Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, denounced the barring of <PERSON> Zhu </PERSON> as `` a violation of international norms.'' However, he declined to say what intelligence role <PERSON> Zhu </PERSON> plays for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> retaliated by notifying the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> that it was canceling plans for two Chinese narcotics agents to attend a <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> international training session at <LOCATION> Quantico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, in the fall. Government sources told the newspaper that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials tried to downplay their refusal to give <PERSON> Zhu </PERSON> a visa by arranging for the <ORGANIZATION> Interpol </ORGANIZATION> meeting to take place at the group's <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> headquarters instead of in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Zhu </PERSON> reportedly attended the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> gathering. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stiener </PERSON>, chief of <ORGANIZATION> Interpol </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> national central bureau, was `` too tied up and wo n't be able to talk'' about the <PERSON> Zhu </PERSON> incident, spokeswoman <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sweatman </PERSON> said. However, she said <PERSON> Zhu </PERSON> was elected a delegate at <ORGANIZATION> Interpol </ORGANIZATION>'s 1985 general assembly meeting in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which means that he attended that session. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence source told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> raised objections to <PERSON> Zhu </PERSON>'s most recent attempt to enter the country because they knew more about him after the Chin case than they did in 1985.

 Four inmates, including two convicted murderers, fooled prison guards by putting `` dummies'' in their cots and escaped overnight from a state prison in central Arakansas, officials said today. The escape was discovered at 7 a.m., but prison spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> said authorities were not sure when the men broke out of the prison's maximum security unit in <LOCATION> Tucker </LOCATION>, about 30 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>. White said bed checks are usually conducted about every four hours, and the dummies were counted at least twice during the night. `` At the 7 a.m. count, when there was n't any movement, they were discovered missing,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. At about the same time, authorities also found a hole in a fence around the prison. According to White, it was the first escape from the unit. White identified the escapees as convicted murderers <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Renton </PERSON>, 50, and <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Coble </PERSON>, 29; <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Winberry </PERSON>, 38, convicted of two counts of attempted murder, and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Fane </PERSON>, 31, convicted of aggravated robbery and other crimes. <PERSON> Coble </PERSON> and <PERSON> Winberry </PERSON> escaped from another state prison in November 1986, <PERSON> White </PERSON> said, but were recaptured a short time later. <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's Lt. <PERSON> Boe </PERSON> <PERSON> Fontaine </PERSON> said deputies were using an airplane, tracking dogs and a roadblock in their search for the escapees.

 Democrat <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, the tall, urbane Texan apparently chosen as <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' running mate, is one of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s respected voices on foreign affairs and economic issues. His selection comes 18 years after he began his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> career with a victory over <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the expected Republican presidential nominee this year. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, 67, a low-key politician, had a brief run at his party's presidential nomination in 1976 and was mentioned as a possible vice-presidential running mate for <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> that year and <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> in 1984. He moved into the congressional forefront over the past three years in the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> drive to sharpen the nation's position in global trade. He is a Southwestern conservative, a <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION>, a silver-haired <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> insider. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is the scion of a wealthy landed family from the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. Like most <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> legislators, he has remained loyal to the interests of the oil industry, although believing in a significant role for government in guiding the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy. On the negative side, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> created a furor in February 1987 when it was revealed that he had asked lobbyists to pay $ 10,000 apiece to join him for breakfast once a month. The breakfast club, called the `` Chairman's Council,'' held one meeting and was quickly disbanded. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> returned the money collected from an estimated 40 lobbyists. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> served in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> for six years during the late 1940s and 1950s, then left <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to make money as a businessman in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. After a successful business career, he decided to run for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1970 and was asked why. `` I think people are little bit like ivy. They ought to be repotted once in a while,'' he said. He received a law degree from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> in 1942 and joined the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, earning his pilot's wings and flying bomber missions over the Third Reich. He served as a <LOCATION> Hidalgo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, judge from 1946 through 1948, when he was elected to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. In the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, he once suggested that then-President <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> threaten <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> with nuclear bombs unless they withdraw their forces north of the 38th parallel. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> left the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> without seeking reelection in 1954, and became president of <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION>, a financial holding company. In 1970, he decided against long odds to challenge incumbent Sen. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Yarborough </PERSON>, who represented the liberal wing of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Yarborough </PERSON> of supporting the violence which occurred during anti-Vietnam War demonstrations at the 1968 Democratic presidential convention. In the general election against <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> lost most of the minority voters in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, but won big in rural areas and among blue-collar Democrats. During his years in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> gradually moderated his conservative views, often voting for a broader federal role on social issues, and gradually opposing the Vietnam War. `` We have fulfilled our commitment,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said in 1971, three years before last <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> combat troops left. After the fighting stopped, he was a prime sponsor of the War Powers Act which seeks to give <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> a bigger role in deciding whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should be involved in armed conflicts overseas. More recently, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> moved into a number of posts which made him better known nationaly. They included a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> campaign committee job in which he dispensed tens of thousands of dollars to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> campaigns of Democrats.

 The legislature of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, a largely Armenian mountain enclave at the heart of a months-long ethnic dispute, voted today to secede from the republic of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> and join <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, reporters in the area said. Reporters for the radio station in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>'s main city, <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>, read a statement by telephone saying the region's lawmakers had taken the bold step at a meeting today `` The Soviet of People's Deputies of the <ORGANIZATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Autonomous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Region </ORGANIZATION> declares its secession from the <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Socialist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>,'' the statement said. It said the legislature had voted with only one abstention to secede and rename the region the Artsakh Autonomous Oblast of the neighboring republic of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. The legal standing of the decision, which defies central authorities all the way up to <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> general secretary <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, is unclear. The Soviet Constitution says any proposed territorial change must be approved by the republic affected. <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>'s parliament rejected <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>'s earlier request to join <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> on June 17. Armenians, who are mainly Christian, consider <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> to be part of their ancient homeland, but it was incorporated into mostly Moslem <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> in 1923. The dispute erupted in strikes and street demonstrations by Armenians in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> itself in February. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said at the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conference June 28 that it was time to widen the powers of the country's 15 union republics, the autonomous republics and other ethnic entities. But he said some ethnic minorities were going too far. `` Some think that any questions _ from the redrawing of borders to the establishment of opposition parties _ can be resolved'' through glasnost, or greater openness, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> believes such abuses of democratization run counter to the task of perestroika, contradict the people's interests,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said Perestroika is <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s wide-ranging program to restructure Soviet society <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>'s legislature had voted Feb. 20 to request the transfer, but today's decision amounted to a unilateral declaration of secession. The <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> legislature had proposed a compromise on June 21, saying the area could be turned over temporarily to the central government in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> while a longer-term solution was sought. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> said today that most Armenians have decided to return to work and quit a weeklong general strike in their capital, <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>. The walkout began July 4 and virtually paralyzed <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> and other parts of the Armenian republic. Armenians are demanding the annexation of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. Pravda quoted local party leaders as saying 195 out of the 231 industrial enterprises in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> were operating at full volume Monday. It said 31 others were partially operating and five remained shut. Of the city's 1,249 streetcars, trolleybuses and buses, only 170 did not operate, Pravda said. However, dissident journalist <PERSON> Mofses </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorgisyan </PERSON>, a resident of the republic, said the walkout was gaining strength and that on Monday, factory representatives reported 70 percent absenteeism. He said troops and tanks were deployed on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, and militia were patrolling within city. <PERSON> Gorgisyan </PERSON> said 300,000-400 ,000 people gathered outside <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ancient </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manuscripts </ORGANIZATION> on Monday to drum up support for the A reporter for the republic's state-run news agency, Armenpress, who declined to give his name, put the number of demonstrators at about 100,000. <PERSON> Gorgisyan </PERSON>, 27, is a member of an underground group called the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Self-Determination </ORGANIZATION> and publisher of an underground journal called Fatherland. Many Armenians decided to return to their jobs because of appeals by prominent cultural figures at a demonstration Sunday, who asked them to use other means of protest, said a <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> resident contacted Monday by telephone. `` They suggested meetings, open statements, but not strikes,'' said the resident, who identified himself as a television reporter but declined to give his name. The government daily <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said hundreds of thousands of people attended Sunday's rally, and that some speakers harshly criticized Armenian delegates to the June 28-July 1 <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conference in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for `` not defending national interests.'' Resolutions adopted at the conference did not mention the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> dispute. Ethnic rioting sparked by the territorial dispute broke out in the <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION> in February, and officials said 32 people were killed, including 26 Armenians and six Azerbaijanis.

 South African, Angolan, <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials met today for the last day of their talks on ending South African rule in neighboring <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> and withdrawing <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. The military and political officials held the talks at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> base on Governors Island in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> harbor. The participants in the talks have released no comments on the outcome of the talks. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has said it would accept a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolution calling for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s independence under black majority rule only after the withdrawal of an estimated 50,000 Cuban troops backing <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s Marxist government. Anti-communist rebels, backed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, have been fighting government troops since 1985. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, have said the timetable for the Cuban pullout has not been set and is the most difficult issue in the talks. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goal is a complete Cuban withdrawal within one year, when a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> resolution has proposed granting independence to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, also called <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> have said that the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> withdrawal should take place over four years. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> has been convulsed by civil war since it gained independence from <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> in 1975. The government, supported by <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, has been fighting anti-communist rebels belonging to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has repeatedly sent troops across the border from <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> to support the rebel forces. The Angolan government is seeking the permanent withdrawal of all South African forces from its territory. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has increased its troop strength in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> from 35,000 to 37,000 soldiers last fall to about 50,000 now, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have said. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has had administrative control over <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> since 1920.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, apparently having chosen <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> as his vice presidential running mate, smiled and joked with news photographers today but declined to talk about the choice that sources said he'd made. The sources, who commented only on condition they not be named, said the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator was chosen late Monday night in a meeting among <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, his long-time confidant <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> and campaign manager <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON>. The word was passed to <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> late in the night or early this morning and he accepted. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, 67, was flying to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> today to meet with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> refused to speak to reporters when he arrived at the Statehouse today, although he allowed photographers into his office as he sifted through paperwork. `` It's kind of fun, this business running for the presidency,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> met Monday night a few hours after <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> talked with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. As <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> left the house, he was asked if the selection process was over and he replied, `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> -RRB- can always ask more questions if he wants.'' Asked if a decision had been made, the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> lawyer said, `` No comment.'' While he waited for <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> appeared in his yard shortly after dark, dressed in shorts and a short-sleeve shirt and mowed his lawn with a push mower. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was meeting today with party chairman from around the country, a session designed to assure them that they would be included in planning for the fall campaign. `` We asked for the meeting,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruvolo </PERSON>. `` We wanted to get things squared away.'' <PERSON> Ruvolo </PERSON> said he had no idea what the status was of his state's vice-presidential favorite, Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Speculation about the potential vice presidential choice was a top subject of conversation in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> among the early arrivals for the convention. The top contenders were believed to include <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. Also on the short list were Sens. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and Reps. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. The contenders themselves were maintaining a discreet silence _ except for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> who said for the first time that `` if it was offered to me I would accept it.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> made his statement after meeting with <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, his first public declaration that he would accept the spot if <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> offered it. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he gave <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> the detailed personal financial information that has been solicited from prospective running mates, and said he offered his `` candid view as to the office of vice president ... and what I thought my qualifications would be.'' <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> refused to discuss the substance of the discussion, saying only that it was `` an excellent meeting ... very productive.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said `` it is self-evident'' that he wants to be vice president and said he assured <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> that he would be a loyal second to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. If he is not on the ticket, said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, he would expect further discussions with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> about his role in the fall campaign.

The Gazelle flew to <LOCATION> Coronado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, a commuter airport on the north side of <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, where it hovered as police drove up. It headed south as a state police helicopter joined the chase, and headed for <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. There, the Gazelle tried to ram the Customs craft and to force the police copter into a crane. `` We were hanging right with him,'' said state police pilot Maj. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Denko </PERSON>. `` We were not giving him a chance to set down and get away.'' The Gazelle landed on the airport tarmac with its pursuers right behind, <ORGANIZATION> Denko </ORGANIZATION> said. The pilot `` was running low on fuel. He was getting desperate.'' A man later identified as <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> leaped out, `` looked around for a second, put his hands up and flattened on the ground,'' he said. The pilot, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> `` Cheater'' <PERSON> Bella </PERSON>, 43, of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, was found in the helicopter, handcuffed to the controls, authorities said. `` No one was armed when we got to them,'' <ORGANIZATION> Denko </ORGANIZATION> said, adding that officers saw two guns thrown out of the helicopter during the chase. <PERSON> Bella </PERSON> was being held at the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Jail today while police checked his story that he was hijacked after flying to <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION> to pick up a fare. <PERSON> Bella </PERSON>, owner of Bear Helicopters, was hired by a man who identified himself as a businessman, said his wife, <PERSON> Carrol </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>. He told his wife that Ms. <PERSON> Shoemaker </PERSON> put a gun to his head and handcuffed him to the control stick. <PERSON> Bella </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Gazelle </PERSON> played the `` Russian'' copter movie star <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallone </PERSON> shot down with a explosive-tipped arrow in `` Rambo III,'' said a friend, <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Mobley </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bella </PERSON> also did stunts in the movie `` Extreme Prejudice.''

 <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>, who four years ago became the first woman on a major party's national ticket, said today she was `` delighted'' with <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' plans to name <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> as his Democratic running mate. She said that had there been enough women in political office to provide <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with a good choice for a female running mate she would have been disappointed at his choice of a man. `` But because we do n't have a woman in that spot, I am not -LRB- disappointed -RRB-,'' she said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>, part of the losing Democratic ticket with <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> in 1984, said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> `` has been fine on issues that I and many women care about and in addition to that he's going to be a very strong help to the ticket, rounding it out beautifully so that with a Democrat in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> it's going to make a difference for the women in this country.'' `` I'm delighted. I think it's an indication that Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> intends to run a strong national campaign. I think he's going to go down <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and seriously battle the Republicans for those votes that should be ours based upon the conditions facing this country,'' she said Earlier, Ms. <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> that there were not enough women in positions from which national offices are traditionally chosen _ the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and statehouses _ to provide <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with a good choice. She said no women currently in elected office meet <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' need of a candidate strong on foreign policy experience who will also give him geographic balance. She said <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> `` does not have those credentials that, politically, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> needs in his vice president.'' `` Had I not been a woman _ and I'm the first one to say it _ I probably would not have been chosen,'' she told the newspaper. `` In 1984 ... it was time to remove this final barrier from women's achieving political power. She said her candidacy in 1984 and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s campaigns are expanding participation in the political process. `` Between <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s campaign this year and 1984, we as a nation said, ` Enough already, we're going to let everybody have a chance to participate.' That's a big thing nobody can take away,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>, 52, said she also has no bitterness over a national profile that brought harsh scrutiny of her family and criminal investigations of her husband. Her son was convicted of a drug charge this year. `` 1984 was an incredible opportunity for me. That does n't lead one to be bitter. I genuinely feel my husband and son were singled out. That does n't make us bitter,'' she said. `` I'm not going to let that happen to me.''

 Crude oil prices dropped sharply for the second straight day today, tumbling toward the $ 14-a-barrel level in reaction to fears of a relentless supply glut and <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s failure to restrain output. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, a sensitive barometer of price trends, the August-delivery price for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION> was $ 14.49 a barrel by midday, down 29 cents from the 20-month closing low of $ 14.78 set Monday. `` The market is awash in crude and the focus has returned to that,'' said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormack </PERSON>, an energy futures trader with the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` The market just looks extremely bearish.'' The decline Monday erased gains made last week, which were based on fears of supply disruptions caused by a major oil platform explosion in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. Refined products traded on the exchange also fell sharply, although not as steeply as crude. Wholesale heating oil for August delivery fell 2.06 cents a gallon to 41.33 cents, while wholesale unleaded gasoline fell 1.04 cents a gallon to 52.13 cents. At one point during the day, crude prices rose briefly on a news report that the price-monitoring committee of the 13-member Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries might confer soon. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s official news agency said the meeting might be held after the cartel's general secretary, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Subroto </PERSON>, met with officials of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> for talks `` concerning the current oil market situation.'' Output cheating by members of the cartel has weakened the market seriously recently, making <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 18-per-barrel target price more remote than ever The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> has been mentioned as a significant violator. Said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, a trader at <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s energy futures unit, `` Crude has gotten down to a supply-demand scenario. There's simply too much. I think the market needs to see something of substance. The rhetoric of <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> is ridiculous. Every trader considers it ridiculous.'' By some analyst reckonings, the cartel now is pumping as much as 18.8 million barrels a day, more than 3 million barrels a day over its official ceiling of 15.06 million barrels.

 Farm senators unveiled a legislative blueprint today for payments of up to $ 100,000 to prevent heat and lack of rain from driving crop and livestock producers off their drought-stricken land. `` We're not going to see their lives as farmers and ranchers end this year because of a freak of nature,'' declared <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., as he unveiled the measure in a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor speech But <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> sounded a cautionary note concerning the bill's timetable `` This legislation will move as quickly through the committee and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> as the members want it to move,'' he said, echoing statements Monday that reckless speed with the legislation would be a mistake. Farmers and ranchers `` also realize that if we were to try some politically expedient, zip-through piece of legislation, a lot of them are going to be left out,'' he told reporters Monday at the White House. Farm lawmakers emerged from a meeting with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> saying no snags have appeared to slow action on the relief bill calling for federal disaster payments of up to $ 100,000 for drought-stricken crop producers. They said <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> told the president that the measure, which would cancel a 50-cent cut in dairy prices, is shaping up as `` a pretty good piece'' of legislation. <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said Thursday that the need for a bill is now `` urgent'' and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said Monday that he wanted floor action this week. `` I do n't think anybody should put artificial deadlines on it,'' <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> said. `` The important thing is that you tell people about to go bankrupt that there is hope, that there will be planting and raising herds next year.'' As sketched by congressional sources, both <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bills would provide disaster payments for drought-stricken producers of those crops covered by federal farm programs and those that are not. Payments would amount to 65 percent of pre-drought expected earnings, whether from target prices, price-support loans or market prices. But they would apply only to losses in excess of 35 percent of the crop. Any deficiency payments _ income supports provided by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> _ would be deducted from the disaster payments, and there would be an array of other limitations. No individual would be able to receive more than $ 100,000 under the legislation. For example, a corn producer would receive a disaster payment of 65 percent of the target price of $ 2.93 a bushel, or $ 1.90 a bushel multiplied by the amount of his loss in excess of 35 percent of the historical yield he has established with the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. A farmer with 100 acres planted in corn under the program and a 100-bushel expected yield would receive a disaster payment of $ 12,350 under the legislation if his entire crop were wiped out. For livestock producers, a number of programs already in effect would be restructured to take in all types of food animals. The bill also would allow the secretary of agriculture to depart from current practice and provide such assistance to farmers who do not grow their own feed. Blazing sun and lack of rainfall have scorched hay across much of the Farm Belt, and livestock feed is now at a premium. Cattlemen are complaining that they are obliged to rush to market with their herds for lack of feed. Under the bill, farmers would be allowed to plant soybeans and sunflowers on 10 percent to 35 percent of a farm's program acreage without losing the historical wheat, feed grain, cotton and rice bases they have established with the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for purposes of taking part in farm programs. There have been forecasts of a squeeze in soybeans supplies because of the drought, and prices already are high.

 A former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> analyst convicted of spying for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has begun refusing food as a protest against federal authorities allegedly blocking delivery of his letters, his father says. <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON>, sentenced last year to life in prison without parole, started his hunger strike Friday and is taking only water, said his father, <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON>. The 32-year-old federal inmate says he's protesting federal authorities' blocking delivery of his letters from prison, prohibiting visits by his attorney and mistreating his convicted wife, <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON> said Monday. `` We tried to talk him out of it, and he said no, he's going to go ahead with it,'' said <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON>, a biology professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Notre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dame </ORGANIZATION>. `` He feels he's reached the end of his patience.'' His son has been in regular contact by telephone, he said. The younger <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON> is imprisoned at a maximum-security federal penitentiary at <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION>, Ill. He was transferred last month from a medical facility for convicts at <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON>. Since then, letters have been diverted to <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for security checks, but then never forwarded to addressees, the elder <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON> said. `` I know that he sent me letters a month ago, he told me on the phone,'' he said, adding that they had not arrived. <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON> said his son was also protesting inadequate medical treatment for his wife, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON>, also convicted and imprisoned. <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON> complained, too, that he has not been allowed a visit by his attorney for nearly a year, his father said. <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, executive assistant at the Marion prison, did not return calls for comment Monday and today. A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, Lt. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Cullen </PERSON>, said this morning the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> had no immediate comment. <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON> was charged in 1985 with passing classified documents to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> agents.

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, wooing votes at the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> convention, promised today to have a `` positive civil rights agenda'' and paid tribute to <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> `` for running the race, for being heard.'' In an appearance before several thousand people at the 79th convention of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not mention reports of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' plans to name <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> as his running mate on the Democratic ticket <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, delivering his speech beneath a banner proclaiming, `` Vote, Be Heard,'' got a warm reception from the audience. He said he wanted to be heard `` because I do not intend to concede the vote of any American.'' The vice president, certain to be the Republican presidential nominee, said a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration would mark `` a new day'' from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. `` I will have a positive civil rights agenda,'' he pledged. `` I guarantee you I will be personally involved in protecting the civil rights of all Americans,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` This effort will be at the top of the agenda of my attorney general, and he or she will be directly accountable to me for results.'' The audience applauded loudly. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said he had known <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, the runner-up in the Democratic primaries, for a long time in a friendly, personal way. `` And I do n't have to cover up the differences _ I have profound differences with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> on many of these issues, but I salute him for running the race, for being heard, and he deserves a salute from us,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, again drawing loud applause from the audience. The vice president readily acknowledged that Republicans since the days of President <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> have not been able to win much of the black vote. However, he pledged that if elected president his decisions `` will not depend on getting a certain percentage of the black vote. I want to do what is fair. I want to do what is right. And I want to do what is principled.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promised that regardless of the black vote he gets `` you will be heard, I promise you that. You are going to be called on. You are going to be partners in my presidency.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is to address the convention tonight and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is to speak before it on Wednesday. While the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has been criticized as being insensitive to blacks, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has a good relationship with some black leaders and has promised that a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration would have a positive civil rights agenda. By a significant margin, blacks voted for <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mondale </ORGANIZATION> in 1984 and <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> in 1980 rather than the Reagan-Bush ticket. However, in opening the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> convention, <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooks </PERSON>, the group's executive director, said it would be a `` fatal mistake'' for Democrats to assume they have the black vote wrapped up. The <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> is the third special interest group that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has courted this week, following an appearance Sunday before Lithuanians and before a group of farm writers, editors and broadcasters on Monday. Responding to a question from the audience at the <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communicators </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he might consider Senate Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> or any of the other contenders in the Republican primary race as a running mate. The vice president said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> was `` deservedly popular in agricultural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. He knows a great deal about it.'' `` But I just do n't want to start going through long lists or short lists -LRB- of candidates -RRB- because believe me, at this juncture, we do n't have them,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I will say this about <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. He and I went head on head,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> added. `` So did <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>. ... `` My party has never been more unified going into a Republican convention than we are right now thanks to the way <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and the others have been conducting themselves and their sense of advocacy,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` So the fact you ran against somebody certainly in my view would not preclude consideration of that person.'' Outlining factors that will influence his decision, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the fundamental criteria will be who _ man or woman _ is best qualified to take over if something happens to the president. `` I would want a certain philosophical compatability to be there,'' he said. `` Then I will do what all politicians do _ throw a little bit of seasoning in there for geography.'' However, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that factor was not important as it has been. `` I'll look who the Democrats pick and then we will have procedures for selecting, and they will be, getting, soliciting opinion from the senators, the Republicans and members of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committeee </ORGANIZATION> and congressmen and governors and all of that. `` And that will probably be done by the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` Sometimes that's been done in the past. `` And then I will make a very personal decision,'' he added. In a speech that he billed as non-partisan, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> nevertheless took several jabs at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, saying, `` I am not the one who feels that the problems of agricultural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> can be solved by planting more belgian endive.'' He also said a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration would help farmers export more crops, `` not force farmers to produce less. That is the major difference.''

<TEXT>
 Public Order Minister <PERSON> Anastasios </PERSON> <PERSON> Sehiotis </PERSON> today released pictures of three men allegedly involved in a terrorist attack aboard a Greek cruise ship that left 11 people dead and 98 injured. Government sources said today that a woman also was involved in Monday's attack and was photographed on the ship. Her photograph was not made public by <PERSON> Sehiotis </PERSON>, but also was being distributed to airports, border entry points and harbors around <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Authorities had said three men hurled grenades and fired automatic weapons Monday at terrified passengers aboard the City of <LOCATION> Poros </LOCATION> cruise ship. Police said the assailants fled in a speedboat. Greek authorities speculated the attack was part of a failed attempt by pro-Iranian Arab terrorists to hijack foreign tourists taking a island-hopping cruise on the Greek-owned ship. There was no claim of responsibility for the assault. At least one passenger said a gunman spoke what sounded like Arabic. <PERSON> Sehiotis </PERSON> indicated the ship attack was linked to an explosion earlier Monday that killed two men in a rental car near the Trocadero Marina, home marina for the City of <LOCATION> Poros </LOCATION>. Despite repeated questioning by Greek reporters, the minister declined to give any more details other than the names of two Lebanese men `` being sought as involved in this attack.'' He identified them as <PERSON> Hamoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamid </PERSON>, 36, of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, who rented the car and <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zozad </PERSON>, 21, thought to be one of the terrorists on the ship. The minister said both had been in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> since May. A <LOCATION> Piraeus </LOCATION> harbor authority officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he believed the attack was staged by two men and two women who boarded the cruise ship after it stopped at the island of <LOCATION> Aegina </LOCATION>. He said survivors had recognized <PERSON> Zozad </PERSON> in the picture as well as a young woman in another photograph taken aboard the ship. He did not say if a picture was taken of the other woman or if the picture of the other man was the same as that released by Greek officials. Rescuers today pulled a body from the <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> and a second was found on the cruise ship. Nine bodies were recovered earlier, and officials said the casualty count was expected to keep rising. `` We also have found some floating body remains that indicate the death toll could go higher,'' said a harbor authority officer who spoke on condition of anonymity. The ship attack occurred at 8:40 a.m., six hours after an explosives-packed car blew up near the Trocadero Marina, police said. Police said they found an Iranian magazine in the wrecked car. They said the vehicle contained hand grenades and automatic weapons. Terrified passengers scurried for cover and leaped into the sea when the gunmen hurled grenades and sprayed gunfire at the tourists on the crowded vessel. The grenade blasts started a fire and a deck collapsed aboard the ship. The ship, about 16 miles out, was returning to the <PERSON> Trocadero </PERSON> <PERSON> Marina </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Piraeus </LOCATION> from a daylong cruise. Although the harbor authority reported some bodies may have not been recovered, a <ORGANIZATION> Merchant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said all 471 passengers and 22 crew members had been accounted for today. The ministry said that 28 of the 98 originally reported as wounded remained hospitalized today. By today, authorities had released the names of only two of the dead: <PERSON> Antonis </PERSON> <PERSON> Demaizis </PERSON>, the ship's 45-year-old first mate, and a Danish tourist, 33-year-old <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Johan </PERSON> <PERSON> Grabas </PERSON>. `` I was on deck when I heard automatic fire,'' <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Wogewda </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lorient </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, said from his bed in a <LOCATION> Piraeus </LOCATION> hospital, where he was recovering from gunshot wounds in both legs. `` I turned around and was thrown into the air by the impact of the bullets hitting my leg.'' Another French passenger, <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Gelia </PERSON>, told reporters that `` a thin man in white with a dark complexion and dark hair jumped up from his seat ... and started yelling in what sounded like Arabic. <PERSON> Gelia </PERSON> said the gunman took a submachine gun out of his backpack and fired it at passengers. `` Then he said a few more words in Arabic, took out one or two hand grenades out of the backpack and tossed them. That's all I remember,'' <PERSON> Gelia </PERSON> said. Pouring black smoke, the City of <LOCATION> Poros </LOCATION> steamed back to <LOCATION> Piraeus </LOCATION>. The ministry spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the wounded included 34 French, 3 Jordanians, 3 <ORGANIZATION> Danes </ORGANIZATION>, 2 Britons, 2 Norwegians, 1 Moroccan, 1 Swiss and 1 Swede. Seven Americans were on the cruise, but none were among the injured, he said. The ministry spokesman said the ship attack could be linked with a trial starting in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> on Wednesday of a Palestinian wanted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for allegedly bombing a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jetliner over <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> in 1982. A Japanese teen-ager died in the blast and 15 people were injured. The Palestinian, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON>, was arrested at <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> last month. He is to be tried on charges of entering <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> on a false passport, but the government has said it will consider a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> request for his extradition. In October 1985, Palestinian terrorists hijacked the Italian cruise ship <PERSON> Achille </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> during a <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> cruise. They killed a 69-year-old American passenger, <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Klinghoffer </PERSON>. Seven Palestinians were convicted in the attack.

 Nine of the 11 refrigerators in the city morgue broke again, and the stench of decomposing bodies filled the courthouse. `` The boxes are old and they are constantly going out.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> `` Benny'' Begin brings the looks and mannerisms of his father, former Prime Minister <PERSON> Menachem </PERSON> <PERSON> Begin </PERSON>, to his run for parliament and the nostalgia factor could be important for both him and his party. <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> <PERSON> Begin </PERSON>, a 45-year-old government geologist, is the first son of an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> prime minister to run for office. He was chosen this month as a candidate of the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, the right-wing alliance his father founded, in the Nov. 1 elections. He is taller and leaner but the hand and facial gestures, some of his rhetorical flourishes and even his tone of voice are almost identical to his father's. Party officials believe the Begin name on <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>'s list could help it win what promises to be a close contest with the center-left <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> for control of the <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION>, the 120-seat parliament. In an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> <PERSON> Begin </PERSON> insisted he can not fill his father's shoes. `` It is unreasonable to hang hopes on me because my name is Begin,'' he said. `` People like him are born very rarely.'' Begin said he sees little chance for territorial compromise or a peace agreement with neighboring <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, so believes like his father that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should keep control of the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. `` I am not a prophet of doom,'' he said with a smile. `` I look at all the alternatives and seek the lesser evil, the one that does n't endanger <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s survival, which means maintaining absolute Israeli control over the land of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> west of the <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Menachem </PERSON> <PERSON> Begin </PERSON>, 74, was born in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. His mix of charm and fiery rhetoric proved a winning formula for ending three decades of <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> government in 1977. In 1978 he shared the Nobel Peace Prize with the late Egyptian President <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> for the process leading to their peace treaty the next year, then resigned suddenly in 1983 and has been a recluse since. Associates and friends said <PERSON> Begin </PERSON> resigned because he was depressed about <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s loss of more than 650 soldiers in the invasion of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, which began under his leadership in 1982. <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> <PERSON> Begin </PERSON> refuses to speak about his father except to say, `` He's feeling fine, thank you'' and acknowledge the former prime minister as the source of his political aspirations. When interviewed during a party meeting at a country club in <LOCATION> Herzliya </LOCATION>, a seaside town, the younger Begin focused on his own political views. He delivered them with the same rhetorical style and sense of Jewish history as his father, pausing occasionally to sip grapefruit juice from a can or shake hands with well-wishers. He condemned the 7-month-old Palestinian rebellion in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has occupied since capturing them from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 war. `` The Arabs call it the ` intefadeh,' or uprising, but they are simply riots,'' he said. `` That's what they should be called. It is clear that this is a new method to carry out an old goal of the Arab nation to expel the Jews from the land of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> <PERSON> Begin </PERSON> characterized tough army measures used to quell <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> unrest as `` reasonable force'' and disputed the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s contention that a political process would resolve the conflict `` There is no political solution,'' he said, and a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state in the occupied territories `` would be another terrorist state between <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> which would try to take over all of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' `` As long as the Arab nation does n't relinquish its plan to destroy the land of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, there will unfortunately be no peaceful solution,'' Begin declared. The son was born in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and, unlike his father, rarely invokes the Nazi Holocaust as a rationale for his political views. He also is more soft-spoken. He has a doctorate in geology from <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and for the past decade has been studying the viability of building a nuclear power plant in the <LOCATION> Negev </LOCATION> desert. Begin said his role was to determine the risk of an earthquake in the area that could cause a nuclear disaster. <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> <PERSON> Begin </PERSON> has four daughters and two sons aged eight to 23. His wife, <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON>, 45, is a social worker for the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> who deals with people wounded in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s wars.

Asked if he would have to look into investigations of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> at first declined to answer, then added, `` My intention in this as in any areas is to follow the evidence wherever it may lead.'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> could still face an internal department review of his actions. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who appeared with <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> briefing room, called <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> `` the ideal choice for attorney general. `` I urge the Senate to move quickly to confirm him as well as our other <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> nominees so they can roll up their sleeves and get to work enforcing the laws of the land.'' Also awaiting <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation are the deputy attorney general, <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON>; the No. 3 person in the department, Associate Attorney General <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, and the criminal division chief, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> have been on the job since early June; <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> has been at work about a month longer. All were appointed on an acting basis by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. There appeared to little opposition in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to the nomination. Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, the No. 2 Demcorat on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which will review <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s nomination, said he expected a rapid confirmation `` I have the greatest respect for <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. `` The state of justice in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> would be very different today if <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> had been attorney general for the past 3 -LCB- years instead of <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>.'' Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, the panel's ranking Republican, priaded <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s `` deep intellect and unmatched integrity.'' Senate Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> proclaimed <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> `` a tough man for a tough job'' and said the selection `` deserves speedy <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told reporters that <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> `` was a prosecutor's prosecutor for six years as a <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> attorney for <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, a tough-minded crime buster winning an unprecedented number of convictions for corruption and against members of organized crime. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said that, as governor for eight years, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> `` won tough mandatory jail terms for violent and repeat criminals. He was in the forefront of the war against drugs, cracking down on drug traffickers and creating preventive eduction programs for <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> school children.'' News of the nomination cheered officials with Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presidential campaign, who had worried aloud about political damage to the certain <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nominee from the persistent questions over <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s ethics. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, 55, earned a reputation for methodical, steady leadership in 1979 when, after only 72 days as governor, he was faced with the nation's worst commercial nuclear accident, at Three Mile Island near <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION>. Six years later, he said he learned several lessons from the accident. They included: forget partisanship during crises, do n't be afraid to `` scramble the organization chart,'' and `` respect but do not depend on the news media. But it is <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s ability as a prosecutor that set him apart from other attorney general candidates, according to several of his former aides. As <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney for western <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s attacks on organized cime, public corruption and drug trafficking led to his 1975 appointment by President <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> as assistant attorney general in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s criminal division At the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> credits himself in a biography with `` enhancing the effort to combat organized crime and public corruption nationwide.'' As a prosecutor, his targets included a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> customs agent, a county sheriff and a former <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> congressman, <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Whalley </PERSON>, who was convicted in a kickback case. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s calm handling of the <ORGANIZATION> TMI </ORGANIZATION> nuclear plant accident was recalled Monday by Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wyo </LOCATION>., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` I saw him handle that with maturity and skill. He dealt honestly with the issue, without emotion or hysteria. He has a fine grasp of government,'' <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said. Barred by law from seeking a third term as governor, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> at the end of 1986 to head the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Politics </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION>. In the last several days, Republican Sens. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Specter </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and others familiar with <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> have been questioned about him by White House officials. A former <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, told of being asked about <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s views on abortion and replying that those views were not incompatible with the administration's. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> vetoed an anti-abortion bill in 1981, saying it was excessively restrictive, but later signed a weakened version of the measure. As governor, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> frequently testified on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> on behalf of the president's proposal for line-item veto power and a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. He turned down earlier offers from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> White House to head the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> had also been mentioned as a possible running mate for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has been under fire since his arrival in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> over a succession of ethical questions. He announced his decision to leave the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on the same day last week that independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> wound up a 14-month criminal investigation of the attorney general. <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> declined to prosecute, but portions of his sealed report on the investigation reportedly question <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s candor and ethics.

<HEAD>White Activists To Participate In Municipal Elections</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A white anti-apartheid coalition said Tuesday it would not adopt the election boycott strategy of black activists and instead would try to elect pro-integration candidates in municipal elections. The Five Freedoms Forum, which represents 25 human rights and religious groups, said the focus of its campaign would be to elect an anti-apartheid municipal council in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, the country's largest city Segregated elections for councils in white, black, mixed-race and Asian communities are scheduled nationwide for Oct. 26, the first time voters of all races will go to the polls on the same day. The government has outlawed public calls for an election boycott, but black activists have said they oppose participation in any elections until <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 26 million blacks are given voting rights on the national level. Prominent anti-apartheid clergymen two weeks ago defied the government ban and urged <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION> not to vote in October. The Five Freedoms Forum, in a statement, said it was not criticizing those who favored a boycott of the elections. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Johannesburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, as a whites-only body, is a structure infected with the racism implicit in the government's apartheid policy,'' the statement said `` However, despite the inadequacy of these structures, we do not believe that any purpose would be served by calling on whites to boycott.'' The statement said the elections could be used as a vehicle for campaigning against apartheid laws such as the Group Areas Act, which establishes racially segregated residential districts. By law and custom, apartheid establishes a segregated society in which the blacks have no vote in national affairs, controlled by the 5 million whites. The government is spending more than $ 2 million on an advertising campaign to promote participation in the elections. Officials of <ORGANIZATION> Transvaal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Province </ORGANIZATION>, which includes <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, on Tuesday called on employers to help their black workers register to vote by obtaining forms that could be filled out at workplaces.

<TEXT>
 Superpower arms talks resumed Tuesday after a seven-week break, and the chief <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiator played down hopes for a breakthrough on a treaty slashing long-range nuclear arsenals. Disagreement at the negotiations, which began in March 1985, centers on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plans for a space-based missile defense and Soviet insistence on limiting sea-launched cruise missiles. Many anti-cheating provisions also remain open in a draft agreement of more than 300 pages. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet teams held a two-hour plenary meeting at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mission to launch the 10th round of talks, for which no end has been set. The talks had recessed for the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit. A source close to the talks who demanded anonymity called the initial two-hour session `` productive'' but declined to say if new proposals were made. `` Some interesting things were said,'' the source said, refusing to elaborate. Before the opening session, chief <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiator <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Kampelman </PERSON> reaffirmed <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s stand that the draft pact halving each side's strategic stockpile `` should not be held hostage'' to limits sought by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s missile defense program, the Strategic Defense Initiative. Asked whether a possible fifth superpower summit or the end of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s presidency in January could be target dates for agreement, <PERSON> Kampelman </PERSON> said talks will `` continue no matter who is president and no matter who the leader of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is.'' `` I do n't think important issues should be governed by the calendar,'' he told reporters before the opening session. `` If it takes longer fine, if it takes shorter fine.'' <PERSON> Kampelman </PERSON> said on Monday that an agreement was still possible under the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. He and his top two aides were to brief <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies on Wednesday in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> on the start of the talks. The negotiations are to continue Wednesday or Thursday, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side said. At the May 29-June 2 summit in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and General Secretary <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> ordered negotiators to continue `` energetically and purposefully'' after the two leaders made only limited progress on arms control. <PERSON> Kampelman </PERSON> told reporters Monday: `` Do n't look for drama. We're at a stage now where hard work is required rather than drama. Soviet chief delegate <PERSON> Alexei </PERSON> <PERSON> Obukhov </PERSON> said on Sunday the talks must not lose momentum. Both said the talks have come `` a long way'' but <PERSON> Kampelman </PERSON> noted much still remains to be resolved. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> agree the proposed Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty should cut each side's stocks over seven years to an overall limit of 6,000 nuclear warheads and 1,600 launchers, such as heavy bombers and land-based intercontinental missiles. Some details of monitoring compliance are also set. But <PERSON> Obukhov </PERSON> said progress was imperative on a renewed U.S.-Soviet commitment to the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> says is threatened by Strategic Defense Initiative, also known as SDI. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> says SDI does not violate the ABM pact, and <PERSON> Kampelman </PERSON> reaffirmed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side will not allow <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> `` to use these negotiations to have us end our Strategic Defense Initiative.'' The <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> negotiators have yet to agree on a joint text pledging each side to observe the ABM treaty for a certain period. <PERSON> Obukhov </PERSON> also pressed for limits on long-range, sea-launched cruise missiles and verification measures including inspections of warships. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has balked, saying the weapons can not be reliably detected. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> START negotiator <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanmer </PERSON> called Soviet verification proposals `` totally impractical'' and said current prospects for resolving the issue are dim.

 Teamsters President <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> was praised at his funeral today as a major civic force in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> and as a `` tough guy'' with heart. The executive committee of the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> union and about 800 other people listened as Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, commended <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> for his appearances before a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee. `` He wanted people to know that there were people in the Teamsters willing to stand up and face the public,'' said <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, who chaired the hearings before the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` He believed in the labor movement, and he was n't afraid to stand up and say so. <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>, he said, `` was a tough guy but one with a heart. He laughed infectiously at bitter taunts that would hurt lesser men.'' Among those greeting guests as they entered was <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, international vice president and president of <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>'s own Local 507. <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON> was charged with <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> in a $ 700,000 payroll-padding scheme at Local 507 and still is awaiting trial. <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> was also a defendant in a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> lawsuit filed two weeks ago in an attempt by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government to take over the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> and rid the union of alleged Mafia domination. <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Voinovich </PERSON> described <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> as a major civic force for <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> and praised him for his assistance in helping the city out of default. <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> was vice president of a state-appointed commission that oversaw <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> finances until it rose out of default a year ago. Acting President <PERSON> Weldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON> and the other union leaders made no comment as they entered the packed Berkowitz-Kumin Chapel. <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>'s casket was at the front of the chapel, which was draped with flowers. <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>, 61, who died Saturday, had been battling brain cancer and a lung clot. Although his union has been criticized by federal officials, <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> was remembered by local leaders in his hometown of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> as a man dedicated to the city. `` He never had <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> out of his consciousness, even when he was outside <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> and traveling around the world,'' <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Benz </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday. A native of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> who has been involved in organized labor most of his adult life, <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> made a big mark on the community 18 years ago when he helped found the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, an organization to help needy local residents, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, the agency's executive director. The union leadership indicated earlier that it might announce a date to select <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>'s successor as president of the 1.6-million-member union after today's services. The payroll-padding trial had been scheduled to start today but was postponed because of <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>'s battle with brain cancer. <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> denied ever being controlled by the mob. He said he was an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> informant and that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> authorized the hiring of `` ghost employees'' at Local 507.

<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 One of three vials that washed ashore last week on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> beaches contained human blood infected with the AIDS virus, state Health Commissioner Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Axelrod </PERSON> said today. <PERSON> Axelrod </PERSON> said the sample, discovered on <LOCATION> Lido </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> about 20 miles east of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, also tested positive for hepatitis at the state <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> laboratory in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>. Another vial, found on a beach about 40 miles east of the city, contained blood that tested both positive and negative for the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome, <PERSON> Axelrod </PERSON> said. A third vial tested negative, the health commissioner said. <PERSON> Axelrod </PERSON> said the chances of beachgoers getting infected with the AIDS virus or hepatitis, by either stepping on the vials and being cut by broken glass or from blood spilled on the beach or in the water, are `` remote.'' Neither virus can survive for long outside the human body, and the sample that tested positive for the AIDS virus is believed to be inactive. `` The conditions to which the infected samples were exposed almost certainly destroyed most if not all the active virus,'' <PERSON> Axelrod </PERSON> said. While the results `` confirm some of our fears'' about the danger of the material that washed up on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> beaches, <PERSON> Axelrod </PERSON> said `` we do not feel the presence of these materials represent a significant public health hazard.'' <PERSON> Axelrod </PERSON> said investigators do not yet know where the vials originated or how long they were in the water. But the commissioner said they are of a design that is `` clearly associated with the medical establishment.'' The vials could have come from a doctor's office, medical research facility or a hospital, he said. The discovery of blood samples and other medical debris temporarily closed some of <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>'s most popular beaches late last week in the midst of a prolonged heat wave. When the beaches reopened over the weekend, attendance was cut in half in many places. As of today, all beaches on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> were open except for a 1.4-mile stretch of <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>.

 Police attacked and arrested steel workers who threatened to strike during <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s visit, and today surrounded a church where some workers took refuge, opposition activists said. A government spokesman confirmed a `` conflict-prone situation'' at the church, and said at least one person was temporarily detained after the incident Monday night in the southeastern city of <LOCATION> Stalowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wola </LOCATION>. But he denied any organized police attack. <PERSON> Ewa </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomaszewska </PERSON>, a spokesman for the banned Solidarity trade union movement, said an undetermined number of people were detained. `` We suspect that the action is an act of revenge for a rally that took place July 7,'' said <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Romaszewski </PERSON>, who monitors human rights for Solidarity. About 50 people retreated into the grounds of the church, said <PERSON> Romaszewski </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Tomaszewska </LOCATION>. About a dozen remained there today, said <PERSON> Ewa </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaberna </PERSON>, a Solidarity activist in the city, speaking in a phone call from the church. Police in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> rarely enter church grounds to make detentions. `` Conflict-prone situations did arise there yesterday ... But I can say that there were no major disturbances,'' said a government press spokesman, <PERSON> Ryszard </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>. But he added, `` I can not say that not a single policeman used his truncheon because I was not there.'' There was no effect on work at the <LOCATION> Stalowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wola </LOCATION> steel mill, where the workers are employed, he said. <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> said police moved in when members of the Solidarity committee of the mill attempted to launch a rally outside the church. He denied a report that riot police were involved and said only normal patrols were continuing at the church Tuesday. A strike occurred at the mill April 29-30 during <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s worst wave of labor unrest since the December 1981 military crackdown that stifled Solidarity. About 4,000 <ORGANIZATION> Stalowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wola </ORGANIZATION> workers were reported by Solidarity spokesmen to have rallied Thursday to demand reinstatement of seven dismissed members of the April strike committee. Rally organizers said that if the seven were not rehired, they would call a strike during the <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> visit. The Soviet leader and his wife <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> arrived Monday and are scheduled to stay until Saturday. Today, they were visiting the southern city of <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tomaszewska </PERSON> said a strike at the <LOCATION> Stalowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wola </LOCATION> mill was expected `` in the upcoming days,'' but no date had been set.

 In an election-year bow to an agency that serves one-third of all Americans, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted Tuesday to give the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> a seat in the president's <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>. The bill was passed by an 84-11 vote. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved similar legislation last November, a week after the idea was advanced by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Negotiators from the the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> will work out minor differences between the two bills. The Department of Veterans' Affairs would become the 14th in the Cabinet and the fifth addition since 1960. The change would take effect Jan. 1, 1989. Sponsors said veterans and their dependents deserve to be heard in the highest councils of government. Opponents called the bill another example of congressional pandering to special interests. `` In recent years the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> has frequently been relegated to a relatively insignificant role within the executive branch, with the administrator having little or no access to the president or other top officials in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION>, who has been promoting a veterans' department since 1975, said his support is not aimed at getting more money for veterans `` Given the nature and scope of the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION>, it is appropriate that we make it an executive department ... -LRB- to -RRB- ensure that these federal dollars are more effectively administered.'' Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, R-Wyo., a former <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman, opposed creation of the Cabinet seat He bitterly criticized some veterans' service organizations for supporting the bill while they fought another measure, passed Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, that would allow courts to overturn some VA decisions on veterans' benefits. `` If anybody believes veterans needed a stronger voice ... than they already have, then I've missed something in the nine years I've been year,'' <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said. Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, called the bill `` absurd ... silly ... goofy ... illogical ... irresponsible. This is rubbish. This is unprincipled -LRB- prostitution -RRB- after special-interest groups.'' According to the Veterans' Affairs Committee, <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> serves 27 million veterans and 49 million dependents or survivors with a budget of $ 30 billion, making it the largest independent federal agency. It will dispense $ 14 billion in income maintenance and $ 626 million for education and rehabilitation assistance this year. The agency and its 240,000 employees administered 90,000 patient beds in 534 health facilities and will see 20 million outpatients this year. It runs 109 national cemeteries and will bury 300,000 veterans this year. The <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> estimated that converting the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> into a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> department would cost $ 33 million over five years. The biggest part of the cost would go for changing signs on VA buildings. The bill would reorganize <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> operations and allow the secretary of veterans' affairs to name up to four assistant secretaries and 15 deputy assistants. The legislation requires that the top operating officers _ the chief medical director and chief benefits director _ be selected on the basic of expertise and without regard to politics. Voting against elevating VA to the Cabinet were Sens. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, R-Colo.; <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, R-Wash.; <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Garn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>; <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON>, R-Kan.; <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Idaho </LOCATION>; <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, D-Wis.; <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>; <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Symms </PERSON>, R-Idaho.

 Faneuil Hall, the historic building picked by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to introduce <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> as his running mate, has been a centerpiece of both the American Revolution and of a modern economic revival. A box-shaped brick structure with a steeple crowned by a grasshopper weathervane, the Great Hall in <LOCATION> Faneuil </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION>, as it is formally known, was built in 1742 as a gift to the city by merchant <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Faneuil </PERSON>. It earned the nickname `` The Cradle of Liberty'' as a forum for revolutionaries grousing about the taxation policies of the British Empire and plotting their revolt. Later it was the staging ground for anti-slavery, temperance and women's suffrage rallies. Among speakers who stood there were <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglass </PERSON>, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> and <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON>. Still much in use for public celebrations and political speeches, it was here that Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., announced his candidacy for the presidential nomination in November 1979 <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has also stood on this stage before. The 900-seat hall just 100 feet from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> was the background for some tapings of `` The Advocates,'' a public affairs TV program he moderated in 1970-73, before he became governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. The building, owned by the city and maintained by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, became the anchor of a 1970s refurbishment of the Faneuil Hall Marketplace, a cobblestoned mall of boutiques, food stalls and souvenir vendors.

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military team goes to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> on Wednesday to pick up what may be the remains of 25 missing American servicemen. It will be one of the largest shipments of remains given to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials since <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces withdrew from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in 1973. The remains are to be loaded onto a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> C-141 transport plane during a simple military ceremony, then flown to <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> laboratories in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> for analysis, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Mather </PERSON> said on Tuesday. Mather is leading the team of about 20 personnel from the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casualty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and the Army Central Identification Laboratory. <PERSON> Mather </PERSON>, head of the resolution center's office in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, said the Vietnamese have not given him any details about the remains. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government appreciates the initiative taken by <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to repatriate these remains and hopes it represents just one of many continued steps to resolve this long-standing humanitarian issue,'' a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy statement said. The shipment of remains will be the fifth since retired Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vessey </PERSON>, acting as a special presidential envoy, reached an agreement in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> in August under which <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> agreed to speed up the search for remains. In return, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> sent several medical teams to explore how private <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agencies could help Vietnamese, including veterans disabled in the war against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> does n't give official aid because of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s military occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> About 58,000 Americans lost their lives before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces withdrew from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in 1973. The North Vietnamese communists won the war in a lightning offensive in April 1975. The last shipment of remains, on April 6, was the largest ever. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> returned 27 sets of remains it tentatively identified as those of Americans, and three other sets which it said were those of ethnic Asians who might possibly be among the missing Americans. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has returned more than 150 sets of remains that have been confirmed as those of Americans. The lack of diplomatic relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has hindered progress, and 1,761 Americans remain unaccounted for.

<HEAD>U.S. Wants Review Of ABM Pact, But Soviets Have Not Replied</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has proposed to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> a review be held soon of the 1972 treaty that restricts the two superpowers' defenses against ballistic missiles, but <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has not replied, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said Tuesday. The review would set the stage for a decision by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on whether to scrap the accord, considered a main pillar of arms control efforts and a restraint on his quest for a space-based defense against Soviet rockets. The treaty states that a review conference be held every five years. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal is that it be held in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, beginning on Friday or next Monday, said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, who spoke only on condition of anonymity. Since the Soviets have not replied yet, it is unlikely to be held that quickly even if the response is favorable, the official said. In the meantime, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has to decide whether the Soviets' phased-array radar station at <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> is a `` material breach'' of the treaty His senior advisers discussed the issue at an unpublicized meeting last week of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> and did not reach a consensus. In two reports to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the president has charged the radar stations violated restrictions imposed by the treaty. But that does not mean he will conclude the pact should be scrapped. Some of his advisers are known to be suggesting <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> try to persuade the Soviets to level the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> facility in the interest of preserving the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty. More hard-line advisers reportedly are recommending he accuse the Soviets of a `` material breach'' of the pact and abrogate it. <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, declined on Monday to discuss the options presented to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` No decision has been made,'' the spokesman said. `` The issue is under review.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said ` ` there are sound and valid arguments on both sides of the question'' and that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would make a decision `` before the review. The treaty constrains defenses against ballistic missiles on the theory a potential aggressor might hold back if his country faced retaliatory devastation. The Soviets have denied <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s accusation that <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> is a treaty infraction, but many American analysts who question the president's views on other arms control issues concur in his judgment about <PERSON> Krasnoyarask </PERSON>. In the meantime, the treaty limits how fast and far the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can go in its search for a space-based defense against ballistic missiles that uses such sophisticated technology as laser beams and kinetic energy. The program, known formally as the Strategic Defense Initiative, is being carried out under what the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration describes as a `` strict interpretation'' of the 1972 treaty. A broader interpretation would provide more leeway and scrapping the treaty would remove all legal restraints.

<HEAD>In Waterville, the Maumee River Doesn't Flow Much These Days</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WATERVILLE, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Maumee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> is hardly flowing these days in this town whose name conjures images of waterfalls and flowing streams. `` It is amazing,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, 53, who has lived near this village in northwest <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> most of his life. `` I do not think I have ever seen the river this dry. We have had some droughts, but nothing like this.'' The <LOCATION> Maumee </LOCATION> has been the lifeblood for many communities along its banks. But this summer, levels in some stretches of the drought-stricken river have dropped so low that communities have implemented mandatory water use restrictions. Few villages have suffered as much as <LOCATION> Waterville </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> says the <LOCATION> Maumee </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Waterville </LOCATION> is flowing at 12 percent of its normal rate. Water use has been restricted since Memorial Day. Two weeks ago, <LOCATION> Waterville </LOCATION> officials asked Grand Rapids, about 10 miles to the south, to open an old canal to release more water into the <LOCATION> Maumee </LOCATION>. The state rejected the plan, saying the situation was not that critical. However, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Holycross </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Waterville </LOCATION>'s village administrator, said Monday that the flow of water on the <LOCATION> Maumee </LOCATION> has increased _ though not enough _ over the last week. `` I still can not tell you why,'' he said. `` I do not know whether it was because of rainfall along the river.'' The 80-mile-long <LOCATION> Maumee </LOCATION> originates in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, snakes through several northwest <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> counties and empties into <LOCATION> Maumee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> on </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'s fourth-largest city and on the banks of the <LOCATION> Maumee </LOCATION>, has n't suffered from the water shortage, since it draws all its water from <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION>. The drought has affected other streams in rural northwest <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. The 120-mile-long <LOCATION> Sandusky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, another <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION> tributary, has more than its share of dry spots, and thousands of fish have been killed near the <LOCATION> Ballville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dam </LOCATION>, Fremont's main reservoir, said <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Lash </PERSON>, the city's safety-service director. In <LOCATION> Fremont </LOCATION>, about 30 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>, officials have reached an agreement with the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Division of Water to release 10 million gallons daily for five days from a reservoir near <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION>. After that, the state will provide 5 million gallons a day from the reservoir for as long as needed. Lash said it will take a week to 10 days for the water to make the 100-mile trip north to <LOCATION> Fremont </LOCATION>. In Fostoria, which draws its water from the 50-mile-long <LOCATION> Portage </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, voluntary water restrictions are in place. But that could change, said <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Macias </PERSON>, the city's safety-service director. The city's reservoirs, he said, have enough water to last for several months, but is afraid the reserves could be depleted quickly if the drought continues. <PERSON> Macias </PERSON> said scattered showers that fell over the region on Sunday and Monday did little to alleviate the problem. `` We only got about four-tenths of an inch, not enough to pick up any water at all. We would need two weeks of that kind of rain to have the normal water flow in the river,'' he said.

 A rescue attempt failed to save a Boy Scout and his scout master brother from a rain-swollen river in central <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and raging flood waters swept four family members to their deaths in a creekbed in the western part of the state. The body of <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Tellez </PERSON>, 13, was found in the <LOCATION> Guadalupe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> on Monday afternoon, and the body of his brother, 33-year-old <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Tellez </PERSON> was found today, officials said. The two were in a stalled pickup truck at a low-water crossing with <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Knight </PERSON>, director of the nearby <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Creek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scout </ORGANIZATION> camp, authorities said. <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> said he managed to swim to safety after a failed rescue effort. The river had risen 21 feet Monday near Hunt, about 50 miles northwest of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, destroying piers and docks at summer camps along its banks. The river began receding Monday afternoon. Four members of a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, family drowned Sunday when flood waters sent their station wagon down a creekbed in <LOCATION> Pecos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, authorities said. A fifth family member, <PERSON> Cipriano </PERSON> <PERSON> Enriquez </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriquez </PERSON>, 47, clung to a tree overnight, then walked to a town about four miles away to report the accident, said Sheriff <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. Killed were <PERSON> Rodriquez </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibarra </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriquez </PERSON>, 55, their son-in-law, <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarette </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON>, 30; and two grandchildren, <PERSON> Govanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriquez </PERSON>, 12, and <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriquez </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 7. In western <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, authorities today recovered the body of a third boy who drowned Monday after they were swept into the <LOCATION> Gunnison </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from a ledge at the base of a dam. A fourth boy, the twin brother of one of the drowning victims, managed to reach safety, officials said. The <ORGANIZATION> Mesa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the boys were crossing the base of Roller Dam about noon Monday when one of them slipped and fell in. The others either jumped or slipped into the river pool in an effort to help, officials said. In the central <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> drowning, <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> said he got out of the truck when it stalled and went to a nearby home to get some rope and inner tubes. But the rope was too short, he said. `` They were inside and they started to panic. I went up to the truck to pull them out,'' <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> said. `` We were holding hands and walking past the truck when a tree came up and hit us. We floated about a half mile down to the bend and I was still holding to them. A log hit my head and arm pretty hard and I had to let them go.'' <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Hickey </PERSON>, a witness, said the effort was heroic. She said <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> risked his life trying to save them. `` He had made several attempts at the boy, but the other man pulled them down. When he could n't help them anymore, he got out a long way downstream,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Hickey </PERSON> said.

 A general-alarm fire caused heavy damage to a huge grocery distribution center, sending flames into the sky early today that could be seen for miles. Firefighters contained the blaze, which began Monday night, but said it could burn for hours and consume about a third of the <ORGANIZATION> Safeway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> building, which covers about 500,000 square feet. `` We are just trying to stop it before it destroys everything,'' said Police Sgt. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, spokesman for the joint fire-police department fighting the flames at the eight-building complex. The blaze and massive clouds of smoke could be seen across <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> in downtown <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, about 15 miles to the southwest. `` The big problems here are the size, the magnitude,'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said of the fire, punctuated by occasional explosions, in the one-million-square-foot complex. No injuries were reported among the 600 workers who were at their jobs when the blaze erupted about 10 p.m. in the wooden structure, built about 35 years ago. `` It moved just way too fast to do anything about it,'' said employee <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Karajanis </PERSON>, 19, who was a few feet from where the fire started in paper products stacked on pallets. He said a worker with a forklift tried to move the burning items to isolate them but the flames burned so quickly the man gave up. `` First a number of us tried to put the fire out, but when we saw there was no hope we evacuated the warehouse,'' said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON>, a shipping foreman. Strong winds sent flaming debris flying for hundreds of feet in several directions, setting fire to grass outside. Some 50 firefighters and 11 engines, the entire department in this city of 100,000 people, responded, as well as fire units from three nearby communities, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. The warehouse supplies Safeway stores in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and parts of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>.

 Naval action in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> is helping build sentiment in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to appoint an admiral to head the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Central Command, headquarters for American forces in the region, military sources said Tuesday.

Since the command was created in 1983, assuming most of the functions of the <ORGANIZATION> Rapid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deployment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, the top spot has been rotated between the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>. But because the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has dominated the action in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, many in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> believe the job should go to an admiral. The command has its headquarters at <ORGANIZATION> MacDill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, although it maintains virtually constant radio contact with the overall commander of Naval forces in the gulf, Rear Adm. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Less </PERSON>, aboard his flagship, the USS Coronado. Sentiment to name an admiral to head the command arose before the downing of an <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> jetliner with 290 people aboard on July 3, said the sources. Central Command is a unified joint command in which all <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> forces in a jurisdiction are under the command of an officer chosen from one of the services.

 <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> met today with embassy personnel after the Sandinista government accused him and seven other <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials of inciting unrest and ordered the diplomats to leave the country. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said today that in response to the expulsion orders, he had ordered Nicaraguan Ambassador <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Tunnerman </PERSON> and seven other <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> representatives to leave the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` I have told the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to send their ambassador and seven comrades back to <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> was preparing to leave the country on a special flight later in the day after meeting with embassy personnel. It was not clear if the seven other American diplomats would travel with him. An embassy source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the ambassador was meeting with embassy personnel. In <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s vice president today said no additional diplomatic action was planned against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to protest what he called <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to destablize the country. `` We do n't plan now to go beyond these measures,'' <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> told reporters after meeting with officials of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>. Earlier today, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> called the expulsion of the Americans `` an outrage and completely without justification.'' In <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> also described <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s expulsion order an `` absolute outrage'' and said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> would retaliate. Also on Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> shut down the country's <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> radio station, arrested an opposition politician and closed the lone opposition newspaper, <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION>, for 15 days. The moves came a day after police used tear gas and beat protesters in breaking up one of the largest anti-government demonstrations since the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> came to power. An estimated 10,000 people took part. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Escoto </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats, who were ordered to leave within 72 hours, had engaged in `` activities complementary to the state terrorism the administration of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is carrying out against <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' He said he summoned <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> to his office Monday to inform him of the order. <PERSON> D'Escoto </PERSON> called <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> `` a robot of the maniacal -LRB- Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>'' at a news conference. He said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy officials were at Sunday's rally in <LOCATION> Nandaime </LOCATION>, about 40 miles south of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, at the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministery </ORGANIZATION> said police arrested 42 people. The Sandinistas have repeatedly accused <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats of trying to destablize their government by encouraging unrest. In a letter to <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, <PERSON> D'Escoto </PERSON>'s identified the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats ordered expelled with <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> as <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hope </PERSON>, first secretary in charge of economic and commercial affairs; <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, first secretary; <PERSON> Delvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Junker </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON>, both second secretaries; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Creamer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, third secretaries and vice consuls; and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>, an assistant attache. <PERSON> Melton </PERSON>, 52, arrived as ambassador in May, filling the post left vacant since July 1987. `` This man has violated all acceptable standards of behavior,'' <PERSON> D'Escoto </PERSON> said. `` I told him that here you can not come give orders like a proconsul in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and that this country is sovereign and independent.'' On June 6, 1983, the government expelled three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats accused of taking part in an alleged plot to poison <PERSON> D'Escoto </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> responded by closing several Nicaraguan consulates in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In closing <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catolica </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> accused the station of `` inciting to violence, disorder and lack of respect for constitutional government'' in reporting about Sunday's demonstration In compliance with a regional peace plan, both the station and <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> were allowed to reopen in October after being shut down for more than a year. An official in the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> press office, speaking on condition of anonymity, said police on Monday arrested <PERSON> Miriam </PERSON> <PERSON> Arguello </PERSON>, secretary-general of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> for `` being the principal instigator'' of Sunday's rally. Witnesses said police started Sunday's fracas by pushing at the back of the crowd. They said the crowd threw stones in response to police tear gas. Ten police officers were injured, the official Voice of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> said. It did not say how many protesters were hurt. The Sandinistas came to power in 1979 after a civil war toppled the rightist government of <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>. The U.S.-backed rebels known as Contras have been fighting the government for nearly seven years. They signed a preliminary peace accord March 23 and a tenuous cease-fire remains in effect. In February, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> turned down <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s request for renewed military aid to the Contras.

<HEAD>Boot Camp Program Gets Offenders `Mental Tough, Mental Hard'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Just weeks ago, they were troublemakers, working their way through the criminal justice system, convicted of crimes from drug dealing to manslaughter. Today, they stand at attention, heads shaved, eyes straight ahead. Every phrase ends with an emphatic `` Sir!'' Every item in their foot lockers perfectly folded, every order perfectly obeyed. No, they have n't joined the military. Not exactly. They're probationers at <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sauble </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s 5-month-old experimental `` boot camp'' prison, where `` shock incarceration'' is used to jolt 17 - to 25-year-old offenders into straightening out their lives On Monday, reporters got their first glimpse of the intense physical training and military-style discipline the probationers endure for 90 days. From the first day, the offender is `` told he's an embarrassment to society, ... a parasite to society,'' said Inspector <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON>, an ex-Marine drill instructor. `` We start working on their minds,'' <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> said. `` It's the first time they've ever been held accountable for anything. Instead of holding down a job or going to school, it's been easier for them to knock some old lady on the street and take her Social Security check.'' At first, 19-year-old <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION> did n't think he could make it through the program. `` When I first came here I was pretty scared,'' said <PERSON> Roberson </PERSON>, who was driving drunk when a passenger in his car was killed in a crash. He faced 15 to 30 years in prison for manslaughter. <PERSON> Roberson </PERSON>'s now looking at graduation in two weeks. `` You come in a baby and you leave a man,'' he said. `` This program got rid of my temper and makes me want to go out and do something positive with my life.'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Fetzlaff </PERSON>, 20, of <LOCATION> Manistee </LOCATION>, said he's had time to think about his mistakes, including his breaking and entering conviction. `` They scare everything right out of you the first day,'' he said. `` It's going to change my ways when I get out.'' The program, which began March 1 at a former minimum-security work camp in the <ORGANIZATION> Manistee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, has had seven graduates and now has 70 probationers, about half its capacity. Two men escaped, only to be captured within 24 hours, and 16 others have flunked out, returning to the judge for resentencing, usually resulting in a multiyear prison term. Those who disobey orders may be required to carry a 25-pound `` motivational'' log on their shoulder for the day, or to perform `` motivational'' detail, possibly digging out a tree stump by hand. For the probationers, days begin at 5 a.m. with the screams of a corrections officer or the banging of trash can lids at their heads. Physical training, cleaning buildings and 7 -LCB- hours of chopping trees in county, state and federal parks make up most of the 17-hour days, followed by educational and substance abuse programs at night. One hour of free time may be spent watching television news or writing letters. No visits are allowed, and one 10-minute telephone call may be made each week after the first six weeks. The men march double time, chanting in unison after the officer in charge, `` Mental tough, mental hard! I can do it! You can do it! We can do it!'' A shifting eye while standing at attention may result in 15 push-ups on the spot. There is silence at meal time. The program is modeled after similar programs in other parts of the country, but is designed for more `` hard-core'' offenders than the others, said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hengesh </PERSON>, state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> project coordinator. While offenders must not have served any previous prison sentence, their convictions range from felonious assault and manslaughter to forgery and narcotics possession. `` There are no Sunday school cases here,'' said <PERSON> Hengesh </PERSON>. The Department of Corrections has notified judges and probation officers that the program is an option for offenders who, according to sentencing guidelines, would face at least one year of prison. The only exception would be a probation violator with a new felony conviction, who might be sentenced to a prison term of less than 12 months. Candidates must never have served any prison time and must be physically able to participate. Offenders convicted of sex or arson charges also are not admitted. The program is proving cost effective, with each inmate costing $ 3,846, compared with $ 20,000 each state prison inmate costs annually, <PERSON> Hengesh </PERSON> said. While civil rights activists argue intimidation and fear do n't rehabilitate, state Sen. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Welborn </PERSON>, who sponsored legislation to fund the camp, said he's sold on the program `` I believe a kid in this program has a better chance of going straight when he gets out than in any other program in the corrections system,'' he said. `` The kid that goes into prison comes out a better criminal.''

<TEXT>
 An appellate panel has ruled that Ragtime, a 29-inch high miniature horse, can live in a woman's house and back yard, but neighbors and the city threaten a civil suit The panel of two <ORGANIZATION> Ventura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judges upheld Municipal Court Judge <PERSON> Herber </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON>' September 1987 decision that <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> <PERSON> Fairchild </PERSON> could keep Ragtime on her property. Thousand Oaks appealed that ruling. <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> ruled that a city law prohibiting the keeping of two horses on less than 20,000 square feet of property did not clearly apply to one horse. `` It brought tears to my eyes,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Fairchild </PERSON> said Monday after she learned of the decision by <PERSON> Melinda </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>. The ruling was endorsed by <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Yegan </PERSON>. The city has since revised its ordinance, but Mrs. Fairchild will not be re-cited, said Assistant City Attorney <PERSON> Shawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>. He said officials will rely on a suit by the city or one brought by the <ORGANIZATION> Oakbrook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Homeowners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> to obtain a favorable court ruling. The homeowners group claims the horse creates an offensive stench and violates city rules. Ragtime, a 2-year-old American miniature horse, spends most of his time outdoors at the 6,000-square-foot Fairchild home, but occasionally goes inside to eat or sit on the family couch.

<TEXT>
 The Democratic platform committee today released its proposed platform without the minority planks sought by <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s campaign. The nine-page document would be the shortest party platform in half a century if approved next Tuesday at the national convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> <PERSON> Norton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s chief platform negotiator, said in an interview that the minority planks were left out because `` we're still negotiating.'' She added that talks with <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign `` are going well.'' The 4,000-plus-word document includes all the areas of agreement reached June 25 in a meeting of the 186-member platform committee in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> forces lost votes there on such issues as his call for higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> freeze, no first-use of nuclear weapons, self-determination for the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> and major increases in spending on Head Start, education and other social programs. The platform released today includes a memorandum that says, `` To avoid delay in printing the platform, all parties have agreed that the report on minority planks, which is still under discussion, will be available at the convention.'' The platform promises to `` reverse seven years of ` voodoo economics,' ` trickle down' policies, fiscal irresponsibility and economic violence against poor and working people.'' It pledges the party to seek an indexed minimum wage, `` major increases'' in child care aid for low and middle-income families, advance notice of plant closings and appointment of a national drug czar. It also endorses the Equal Rights Amendment and says `` the fundamental right of reproductive choice should be guaranteed regardless of ability to pay.'' It promises the Democrats will fight homelessness and intensify the war on AIDS, and it says national strength `` will be enhanced by more stable defense budgets.'' `` We believe in an <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, neither gun-shy nor trigger-happy, that will promote peace and prevent war,'' it says.

<HEAD>Carlucci Says Defense Contractors May Be Suspended As Result of
Probe</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said Tuesday he has warned defense contractors that their weapons programs may yet be suspended if they are tainted by the developing Pentagon bribery investigation. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, testifying to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, noted he had lifted a July 1 suspension of contracts for nine military programs because a review had found none were adversely affected by the case. `` But in doing so, we have sent out a warning that says this does not mean if there is further information that comes to light, that we will not once against review this contract and take appropriate action,'' he said. The investigation involves allegations that defense contractors and consultants bribed <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials for details that could have been vital in bidding for contracts worth billions of dollars. No charges have yet been filed. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel he is writing to the chief executives of the top 200 defense contractors, `` urging them to ensure stringent management controls on the use of consultants and to avoid improper business practices.'' `` My job is not to punish companies, my job is to protect the national security,'' said <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, noting that it is up to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to prosecute alleged crimes. But he outlined a number of actions the Pentagon can take, including rescinding, terminating or suspending contracts, or fining individuals. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> admitted that there are problems in the procurement process. `` There are defects in how <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> equips its forces,'' he said. The current investigation is a good reason to correct those flaws, he said. `` Even if the probe reveals no more than the misdeeds of a few greedy lawbreakers, I still want to move forward now, in cooperation with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, to remedy flaws in our system, regardless of whether those flaws are related to the Justice investigation.'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> noted that he has appointed a task force to propose changes and he appealed to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> not to usurp that panel's role. `` Hasty or piecemeal reforms ... could do more harm than good,'' he said. He also urged that the administration be given credit for past changes. `` Our nation has in this decade markedly improved its defense acquisition system. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> probe should in no way tarnish the progress the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have made.'' `` Some of the wrongdoing being uncovered may simply be violations of the law, not system deficiencies,'' he said. `` Some system flaws highlighted by the probe may be ones that our government has not really tackled, such as budget instability and political intervention points.'' `` Some uncovered flaws perhaps were ... unavoidable, consequences of past reforms. For example, one of the most complex issues we face is the impact of increased competition for contracts. High-stakes competition may cause difficult problems that are just now surfacing,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said. He also said one major problem in the process is `` what I would term ` intervention points' - opportunities for friendships or political clout to carry more weight than contractor performance or product quality and cost.'' `` We can reduce these opportunities for intervention through such techniques as long-term contracts, simplifying specifications, freezing weapons designs, contracting to performance, and multiyear approvals of programs,'' he said. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> opposed suggestions that an all-civilian force should be created to buy weapons. `` A remedy for procurement difficulties is not to exclude from the process the military professionals who will use the defense systems we buy,'' he said. `` Our military people have a vital interest in the quality of those systems and in how efficiently we buy them. We must retain user involvement in defense acquisition. That means the military services must continue to play a major role.''

 An inquiry into the reasons that a jetliner lost part of its roof will focus on quality assurance, the design and certification of airplane bodies, and human and other factors in maintenance, the chairman of a fact-finding board said today. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> wants to supplement facts gathered after 18 feet of an <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet's roof peeled back on April 28, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauber </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> as a four-day hearing began. <PERSON> Lauber </PERSON> cautioned that five-person <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> hearing board is not designed to determine who was at fault or who was liable for the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737's accident. Officials have said the hearing will also look into the maintenance and usable life of aging jetliners in general. The first witnesses scheduled to testify were from <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and included the company's vice president of operations, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Derieg </PERSON>. In announcing the hearings, <PERSON> Lauber </PERSON> said an <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> report on the accident would n't be released for months but added that `` safety recommendations to prevent a recurrence of such an accident could be made at any time.'' A flight attendant was swept to her death and 61 of the 94 other people aboard <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> Flight 243 were hurt when the cabin top peeled away on a flight from <LOCATION> Hilo </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, exposing the first-class section to the open air at 24,000 feet. The pilot and co-pilot managed to land the crippled jet 13 minutes later in <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION> although one of the two engines quit. Aviation experts said they were amazed the aircraft could land at all. The damaged plane and two other <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> 737-200s, both later grounded, had the highest number of landings of any <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> commercial jets, officials of the aircraft manufacturer said after the accident. The damaged plane was built in 1969 and had 89,680 landings. The accident prompted the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to order inspections and repairs of older, high-cycle 737s. Those expected to testify included representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, plus experts from <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> today pledged to fight for a proposed sale of Maverick missiles to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and said he believes there is a chance of success. Posing for photographers as he prepared to meet with Crown <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> and Prime Minister <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Saad </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Abudllah </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told reporters: `` You bet we're going to fight for it.

In his formal speech at a departure ceremony after their private meeting, the president said, `` We strongly support the request for F-18 aircraft and accompanying weapons now pending before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.''

<HEAD>Minister Charged With Killing Woman Same Day He Preached Sermon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VICKSBURG, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A minister who led officers to the shallow grave of a woman he allegedly shot on a Sunday before preaching a sermon has been charged with murder, authorities said. The body of <PERSON> Lula </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>, 24, was found Monday night in woods 40 miles from <LOCATION> Vicksburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Warren </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> said. Her family had reported her missing on July 3. The Rev. <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamlin </PERSON>, 24, was charged with murder after he showed up at the sheriff's office with his attorneys Monday afternoon, <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> said. `` We started talking then and by 6 p.m. he said he would take me to the body,'' <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> said. `` He said he knew where it was, but he never did say that he killed her. At that point I charged him with murder.'' <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> said an investigation showed <PERSON> Hamlin </PERSON> shot the woman at her <LOCATION> Vicksburg </LOCATION> home early on July 3. <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> said he believed the shooting occurred during an argument and that <PERSON> Hamlin </PERSON> `` disposed of her body and then returned to <LOCATION> Vicksburg </LOCATION> to preach at Sunday morning worship services.'' Chief Deputy <PERSON> Otho </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hamlin </PERSON>, married and a father of three, became a suspect early last week when authorities learned he was in a relationship with <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>, a divorced mother of three. <PERSON> Hamlin </PERSON> is pastor of <ORGANIZATION> Cool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spring </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Zion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traveler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Vicksburg </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hamlin </PERSON>'s case would likely go to a grand jury in the fall. He is being held without bond in the <LOCATION> Warren </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION>, and no hearing has been scheduled for him to enter a plea. The sheriff said authorities had recovered a .22 caliber, pearl-handled revolver believed used in the shooting. An autopsy has been ordered.

 Orange flames lit the night sky of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> Tuesday as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> launched the second of a pair of space probes on an 111 million-mile odyssey to explore the mysteries of Mars and help prepare for a manned flight to the red planet. Soviet television showed a recording of the 9:01 p.m. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> time -LRB- 1:01 p.m. EDT -RRB- launch of Phobos II during its evening news broadcast. Last week's launch of the Phobos I was televised live, but at the time of Tuesday launch, state-run television was showing coverage of Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. A Soviet-made Proton booster rocket roared to life and carried the solar-panel powered probe off the launchpad at the Baikonur Cosmodrome on the steppes of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. Its companion, Phobos I, was launched skyward atop a 200-foot-high <ORGANIZATION> Proton </ORGANIZATION> booster rocket from Baikonur on Thursday, and Soviet media said its on-board navigation systems were switched on the next day. More than a dozen nations, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, are participating in the international mission to swoop close to the surface of Mars' moon, Phobos, and drop instruments onto the satellite that scientists say may provide clues to how the universe was formed. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s Deep Space Network will provide radio tracking data so the probes can locate the moon, which is only about 17 miles across. If Phobos is an asteroid trapped by Mars' gravity, as many scientists believe, the probes will be able to study matter that is little changed since the infancy of the solar system billions of years ago. If all goes well, the two Soviet spacecraft will enter the gravitational pull of Mars in January and fall into orbit just behind Phobos for a three-month remote study of the Martian surface, atmosphere and magnetic field. Next to <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>, Mars is the heavenly body believed to most resemble the Earth. In April, the two craft will drop out of their orbit and swoop to within 100 feet of Phobos' surface, where they will release two 100-pound landers. The Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said that in one experiment, a laser beam carried by a lander will used to split off a tiny piece of Phobos' rocky surface and trap it for close examination. One of the landers is expected to operate for about a year in a stationary position, sending back data to arth. Another is scheduled to bound like a kangaroo about the little moon in 65-foot leaps, gathering and analyzing soil samples. Soviet scientists say the Phobos mission is an important step toward a manned flight to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>, which they hope will be possible early in the 21st century. Soviet officials have put the cost of the Phobos mission at $ 480 million.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' choice of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> to be his running mate drew praise from fellow Democrats today, with several of them likening it to another Massachusetts-Texas ticket _ <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> in 1960. `` The Massachusetts-Texas combination got this country moving again in 1960 _ and it will do the same for the nation in 1988,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., younger brother of the late president <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> both were quick to draw the comparison between this campaign and the one 28 years ago. `` The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> ex ` es were good for the country and good for the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in 1960 and it's going to be a real winner in November of 88,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said `` Selecting a running mate is probably the first presidential act _ if I can use that word _ that I will do,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in introducing his running mate. `` <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> brings to this ticket and will bring to this nation years of experience.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s `` selection gives the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> a strong ticket for November _ and even more important, the strong prospect of eight solid years of effective new leadership for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> State Treasurer <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>, who will be the keynote speaker at next week's Democratic convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, called <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> `` a level guy'' who `` will make a great vice president'' and added: `` There's always been a sort of <LOCATION> Austin-to-Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, connection, and I think that this ticket adds that same sort of magic.'' Ms. <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> also said that <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> would boost Democrats' chances in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, one of the states that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' likely Republican opponent, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, calls home Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill., whose own hopes for the presidential nomination were dashed earlier this year, agreed that <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> could help the Democratic ticket in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and said he thought the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator might help the Democrats carry <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> as well `` <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is a skilled and seasoned lawmaker,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said. `` This is an excellent choice, and this is a winning ticket. `` Democratic prospects in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> will be boosted immediately and, when the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people get to know <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, it will strengthen the ticket everywhere,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> added. <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON>, who will deliver the nominating speech for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, said he also believed that <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> would help the Democrats carry <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and would help the party across the region. `` I like and respect him very much,'' <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> said. Sen. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikulski </PERSON>, D-Md., said she believes `` <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> will be a fine addition to the Democratic ticket He knows his issues and he knows his politics. Best of all,'' she said, `` he knows how to beat <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. He did just that in 1970 to become <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. senator.'' In <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, where Democrats had been pushing home state Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> for the No. 2 spot on the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ticket, state Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> also offered praise for <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and said a Dukakis-Bentsen victory in his state is `` doable.'' `` We all know it's going to be tough,'' said <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, who is coordinator of the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. But, he added, the choice of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> `` shows a sensitivity to the South'' and `` brings defense and foreign policy and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> experience,'' all considered crucial to a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> victory in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Even backers of <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who came in second to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the race for the presidential nomination and who had been one of those the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor had considered for the second spot, seemed satisfied with <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> state Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, who was the state campaign coordinator for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, said, `` We would have preferred to have had <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>.'' He added, though, that `` <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is a better choice than some of the others he could have picked.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, a former Democratic national chairman who has been advising <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, said he was `` excited'' about the choice of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and said it would `` make <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> a hell of a battlefield.'' Union activists also praised <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, saying that the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator had recently shored up his poor record on labor issues with his deft handling of the trade bill and mandatory plant closing and layoff notices _ some of labor's top legislative priorities this year. `` <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was extremely helpful in recognizing that the two _ plant closing notices and the trade bill _ were compatible,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McGlotten </PERSON>, legislative director for the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>. `` And he let his colleagues know how he felt.'' <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>, who four years ago was picked as Democrat <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>'s running mate, said she was `` delighted'' at the choice of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. `` I think it's an indication that Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> intends to run a strong national campaign,'' Ms. <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> said. On the Republican side, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, frequently mentioned as a possible vice president on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s ticket, said he thought <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` could n't have picked a better man. Rep. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, R-Ill., who is national co-chairwoman of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presidential campaign, called <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> `` a nice man who's able'' but said she still anticipated that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would be able to carry On the similarity to the Kennedy-Johnson ticket of 1960, she said: `` I'm sure we're going to hear 1960 ad nauseum. There's a slight difference of course. He -LRB- <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> -RRB- was not selected by his peers to be in leadership -LRB- as <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> majority leader, had been -RRB-; nor is <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>.''

 Associated Press Writer = <LOCATION> BOSTON </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> today named <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> as his vice presidential running mate for the fall campaign `` We go to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and begin the road to victory,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> likened himself to <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who won the White House for the Democrats in 1960 with <PERSON> Texan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> on the ticket. And like 1960, when Republicans nominated an incumbent vice president and were defeated, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, `` <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> beat that incumbent <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice president in 1960 and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> are going to beat them in 1988.'' He said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> brought to the Democratic ticket `` years of experience and a deep commitment to civil rights ... that goes way back to the 1940s.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> stood for good jobs at good wages _ a central theme of his campaign. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, who received a standing ovation from the crowd, spoke with force and emotion rarely seen from <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> himself. `` The fact that he's chosen a senator from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, a senator from the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, shows that we're going to fight for every state in the Union and we're going all out to win,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, a son of <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> immigrants, was `` living out his parents' dream but wants that dream a reality for all Americans.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> lavishly praised <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> for his work in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` He has hit a grand slam homerun because as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> he has personally and successfully led the fight for welfare reform, for catastrophic health insurance,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> praised his work on a trade bill and a plant closing law that will give workers `` at least 60 days notice before they're thrown out in the street'' `` If <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> can give himself 30 days notice then the least we can do is give honest hardworking workers 60 days notice before we lay them off,'' he said The political marriage was announced in a sweltering <ORGANIZATION> Faneuil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, with political luminaries in the audience and a large crowd of supporters standing outside. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Benstsen </PERSON> were joined by their wives, <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. The hall was festooned with signs proclaiming `` Dukakis-Bentsen'88.'' Campaign staffers threw baseball caps reading `` Do n't Mess with <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>'' to the cheering crowd. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was introduced by another Bostonian, <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>, who also recalled <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s selection of <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> as running mate in 1960. `` We see history repeating itseelf today and we'll see it repeated in November in 1988,'' he said. With his choice, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> signaled a determination to challenge the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> stronghold in the South and especially in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presumed strongest state. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> is his adopted home state. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> has 29 electoral votes, more than any state except <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and some <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides have said they hope selecting a Southerner would at least force the expected <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate to spend more time defending the region than he would want. In 1970, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> defeated <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in a run for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, now the Republican presidential nominee-in-waiting, said recently, `` -LRB- <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> -RRB- does n't worry me,'' adding, `` We can carry the state'' even if <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is on the Democratic ticket. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, 67, is little known outside of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. In a national Gallup poll in mid-May, 77 percent of the people surveyed said they did not know enough about <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> to say what they thought of him. Of the few who had an opinion, 3 percent said they had a very favorable view of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, 12 percent mostly favorable, 6 percent mostly unfavorable and 2 percent very unfavorable. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, an elegantly tailored, silver-haired patrician, is the scion of a wealthy landed family from the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> _ and a card-carrying member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democratic establishment. He is a former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senatorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, a position that requires fund-raising to elect Democrats to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, and has been chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> since Democrats gained control of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> 18 months ago. On at least one key issue, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> has parted company with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, voting for aid to the Contra rebels fighting the Nicaraguan government. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> frequently has denounce the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration support for the Contras a `` failed and illegal policy.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, campaigned with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> last Friday and downplayed talk he would be chosen for the vice presidential nomination, telling reporters: `` I do n't think you have to worry about that.'' At the time, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>: `` He could make a great contribution to this country in many, many ways. He already has.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> as well gave no hint, either in words or body language, that he felt close to the selection. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is up for re-election to his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat in November, and if he chooses, could run for both offices at once _ a precedent set by <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> in 1960. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> will be nominated at the Democratic convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> on July 21, the fourth and final night of the party gathering. Convention delegates must ratify <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' choice. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was chosen over six others who were being considered by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>: <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, Sens. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and Reps. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s selection closes weeks of speculation on who <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would choose to round out his ticket. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had raised the stakes on Monday by saying he would accept if asked. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s reaction to the selection of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> could be crucial to convention harmony and <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> hopes of a victory in November. While the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor has an unquestioned majority in the convention hall, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s response to being passed over may provide the first signal of how hard he will work for the ticket in the fall campaign.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> today chose Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> as his Democratic running mate, duplicating a Massachusetts-Texas ticket that won the White House for <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> in 1960. `` We're going to fight for every state in the Union and we're going all out to win,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told a boisterous <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> campaign rally. In their joint appearance at historic Fanueil Hall, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor cited the parallels to 1960 as well as <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s strengths. `` <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> brings to this ticket and to this nation, years of experience, a deep committment to civil rights and equality of opportunity that goes way back to the 1940s,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` The Republicans in 1988 are about to do what they in 1960, when they nominated an incumbent vice president,'' the Democratic presidential nominee-in-waiting said. `` <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> beat that incumbent vice president president in 1960 and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> are going to beat them in 1988. Early this morning, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> began to call the other Democrats who had made it onto his short list of possible running mates to tell them of the decision. But <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who flew from <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> early today, apparently did not get a call before the choice became known. A curt `` no'' was <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s reponse to a reporter's question in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on whether he had talked with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would only say `` no comment'' on the choice of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> as he headed for private meetings with supporters. He and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> passed through the same <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> airport terminal within minutes of each other today without meeting, as <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> headed to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> with top <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> for his work in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, saying, `` He has hit a grand slam homerun because as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. He has personally and successfully led the fight for welfare reform, for catastrophic health insurance,'' as well as work on a trade bill and a plant-closing legislation. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, 67, said his choice is a clear signal for the fall campaign. `` The fact that he's taken a senator from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, a senator from the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> shows that we're going to fight for every state in the union and we're going all out to win,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. Even as Democrats braced for reaction from party liberal activists and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporters, some Republicans were hard put to criticize the choice. Senate GOP leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, frequently mentioned as a possible vice president on <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s ticket, said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` could n't have picked a better man.'' Former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporter from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> has `` one of the best civil rights records in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. He voted against the poll tax when he was in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> back in the 50s ... He's not a newcomer.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' choice sets up a home-state showdown with the Republicans for the big prize of 29 electoral votes, since Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>'s presidential nominee-to-be, claims <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> as his voting residence. `` It makes <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> a battleground,'' said Republican strategist <PERSON> Vince </PERSON> <PERSON> Breglio </PERSON>. `` The Massachusetts-Texas combination got this country moving again in 1960 _ and it will do the same for the nation in 1988,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, whose brother tapped <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> in 1960 _ a reluctant decision that was instrumental in <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> winning a close election. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in an interview published today that the selection of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> wo n't change his claim to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> `` does n't worry me,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> before <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s selection. `` We can carry the state.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has lost to <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> once already. They squared off in a 1970 race which propelled <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for the first of his three terms. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> chose <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> at a late Monday night meeting with top aides <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON>, just hours after <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> for the first time declared his hopes for the vice presidential nomination. The next 24 hours will provide a highly visible stage for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to give his response to the <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> choice and for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to appeal to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s supporters for the unity he needs for a peaceful convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> next week. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> speaks to the annual convention of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> tonight, following a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> speech there earlier. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> will appear at the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> meeting. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promised the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> that he would fight for civil rights as president, whether or not he receives strong black support in the fall and he praised <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` And I do n't have to cover up the differences _ I have profound differences with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> on many of these issues, but I salute him for running the race, for being heard, and he deserves a salute from us,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, again drawing loud applause from the audience. And the reaction of other liberal Democrats to the selection of the conservative Texan was certain to spark interest in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` Wild, absolutely wild,'' said one liberal party official of the choice. `` I have no idea what his civil rights record is.'' Some <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporters have talked of entering his name in nomination for vice president as a challenge to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, although <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has not spoken publicly on the subject. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is little known outside of his home state, polls suggest. A Gallup Poll in mid-May said 77 percent of respondents had not heard enough about <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> to offer an opinion on the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> chose <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> off a short list of seven possible running mates, including <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, Sens. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and Reps. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> sent <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON>, his campaign chairman, to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Monday to meet with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. It was when <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> to meet with the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor that the decision was made. `` If it was offered to me, I would accept it,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said after meeting with <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON>. He said it was `` self-evident'' that he wants the No. 2 spot on the ticket. He continued to stir his careful mixture of promise and problems for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, saying, `` We intend to have an effective, informative convention that would inspire our nation, unify our party and take us to victory.'' Democrats looking for a peaceful convention saw new signs of hope Monday, as party chief <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> proclaimed the battles over the party platform might be resolved without a messy fight on the floor. `` I do n't expect that there will be any so-called floor fights on the platform,'' <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` There may be differences of opinion. There may be agreements to disagree. All the indications that I have are whatever differences had existed, they are gradually being worked out.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was already sharpening his rhetoric in preparation for a fall campaign that continues to look like a tight battle. `` I am not the one who feels that the problems of agricultural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> can be solved by planting more Belgian endive,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a farm meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The vice president was referring to the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor's suggestion in early 1987 in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> that crop diversification was a solution to agricultural problems, pointing to farmers' experience in his home state A tight race was the analysis from the latest <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll. It put <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ahead of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by a 47-39 margin among 947 registered voters surveyed by telephone last week. The margin of error was plus or minus three percentage points.

 Two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> helicopters traded fire with a pair of Iranian gunboats after the boats attacked a tanker in the northern <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> today, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military sources said. The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there was no damage to the aircraft and it was not known whether the boats were damaged in the clash, which took place at about 7 p.m. The sources said the helicopters, off the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missile frigate <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON>, were responding to a distress call from a Panamanian-flag tanker west of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Farsi </LOCATION> island. `` The helicopters took fire from the two small boats and returned fire with rockets,'' said a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official. `` There was no damage to the helos -LRB- helicopters -RRB-. We have no damage assessment on the boats.'' Shipping executives said the attack on the tanker started a fire in the engine room of the 81,282-ton Universal Monarch, but that the crew put out the blaze on their own and that no one aboard the vessel was injured. It was the second time in less than two weeks that an American warship responded to a distress signal from a neutral ship in the gulf. The previous time was on July 2 in the southern gulf, when another frigate intervened to drive off Iranian speedboats attacking a Danish tanker. The next day, the <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vincennes </ORGANIZATION> shot down an Iranian passenger jet following an exchange of fire with Iranian boats. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said 290 people aboard the plane died. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> said the plane was shot down in the mistaken belief it was an attacking warplane. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has promised to make reparations to the families of the victims. The London-based <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> said the Universal Monarch is owned by a <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> company and managed by the Japanese company <ORGANIZATION> Tokudo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shasen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> K.K. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. The vessel was sailing empty to pick up cargo from the <LOCATION> Khafji </LOCATION> fields, owned jointly by <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, the executives said. <LOCATION> Farsi </LOCATION> island is a stronghold for Revolutionary Guards who often carry out attacks in the gulf. In the so-called `` tanker war'' _ an offshoot of the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq war _ <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> attacks neutral shipping in the gulf in retaliation for <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> raids on its oil tankers. Last Thursday, <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> warplanes raided two supertankers in the vicinity of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Kharg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> oil terminal at the northeastern end of the gulf. The Greek-owned 264,108-ton Fellowship L and the Cypriot 215,780-ton Star Ray were set afire, but no casualties were reported. The Iranian ship attacks have continued despite a broadened role for <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> warships in the gulf, enabling them to protect commercial vessels even if they do not fly the Stars and Stripes. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has attacked two commercial vessels _ the Norwegian-owned tanker <LOCATION> Berge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strand </LOCATION> and the Romanian-owned freighter <LOCATION> Plataresti </LOCATION> _ since the <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vincennes </ORGANIZATION> shot down the Iranian passenger jet.

 <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> is preparing to become the next attorney general at a time when <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and White House officials are trying to launch a major anti-drug initiative in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Acting Associate Attorney General <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> said this week the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is anxious to get legislation revamping portions of immigration law to make it easier to deport aliens convicted of drug trafficking and to bar the entry of drug traffickers into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> said that this is one of about 30 measures the administration wants <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to enact, including one authorizing the death penalty for persons convicted of murder while engaged in a continuing drug enterprise. However, congressional Democrats have yet to appoint anyone to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s joint executive-legislative branch drug task force, which was supposed to shape the legislation, and congressional sources have said the Democrats do n't plan to participate. `` The legislative agenda is stalled,'' <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> told a news conference. `` We think this is an issue which transcends party lines.'' Anti-drug legislation of some kind appears inevitable in this election year. Drug trafficking, as well as two other top <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> priorities, organized crime and pornography, have been at the top of <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s own agenda. His attacks on the three while <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney for western <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> in the early 1970s led to his appointment in 1975 by President <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> as assistant attorney general in charge of the department's criminal division. Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> may still be in office to handle two other major items on the department's agenda. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said Tuesday that his own plans `` have n't ... totally jelled yet,'' but that he still plans to leave toward the end of July or early August, as he said last week when he announced he was resigning. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> reiterated through department spokesman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Korten </PERSON> that he hopes to decide whether the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and the Detroit News should be allowed to merge their advertising, circulation and production operations under the Newspaper Preservation Act. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> also may still be in office when the department decides whether to seek an indictment of former <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, who has been investigated by a number of federal grand juries since he was ousted in February 1986. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> lives in exile in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. However, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> probably will be gone by the time federal prosecutors are ready to seek indictments in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> investigation, which is being coordinated by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION> The indictment are not expected until late in the year. Also on the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> agenda: <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation hearings late this month for <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON> and criminal division chief <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>. All are currently serving in acting capacities. <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> are replacing former Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>, the criminal division head, whose protest resignations March 29 over <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s continued tenure brought accusations of a serious leadership gap in the department. The department under <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> also will be coping with the issue of drug testing. The program would subject 1,800 Justice employees in sensitive jobs to mandatory, random urinalysis. The employees, many of them lawyers, are suing the department, saying the program that could begin shortly violates their constitutional right to due process and to protection against unreasonable searches and seizures.

 Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>, who vanquished three-term Gov. <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> with a reform campaign, finished his first regular legislative session with many more victories than failures, lawmakers say. During an 85-day session that ended late Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> approved a balanced budget, a teacher pay raise, a campaign finance reform measure and a framework to revive the state's stagnant economy. `` When we started 120 days ago, this state was wounded, this state was hurt, this state was down,'' <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> told a joint <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> meeting before adjournment. `` This is a good state and we pulled together to try to bring it back right again.'' `` I think overall the governor has been successful with the programs he has been pushing. He's won far more than he has lost,'' said Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>. When he took office March 15 after defeating <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> last fall, <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> inherited an accumulated deficit of $ 1 billion that threatened to bankrupt a state saddled with a corrupt image he often described as that of a `` banana republic.'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> spent much of his third term successfully defending himself against federal racketeering charges. By the close of the lawmaking session, <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> could point to passage of his plan for overhauling public schools and an $ 8 billion state budget based on conservative oil price projections in this energy-producing state. On the final day of the session, lawmakers also granted the governor continuance of the authority to make emergency budget cuts it granted him during a special legislative session shortly after he took office. However, <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> must first obtain the blessing of a legislative panel. `` I wish reductions to the budget would have been greater,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>. `` I'm not trying to be critical because we did make substantial reductions, but not as much as I think we could have.'' The Legislature also approved restrictions on personal contributions to political candidates and contributions from political action committees. Candidates also will be required to report all donations and expenditures. During his campaign, <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> said he took no PAC money and no contribution larger than $ 5,000. Despite the progress, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s fiscal problems are not solved, said Sen. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, an administration floor leader. `` These problems have not been cured. They wo n't be cured until we have true fiscal reform,'' said <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>.

 An analysis of computer tapes from the cruiser <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> has been delivered to experts trying to reconstruct the shooting down of an Iranian jetliner, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said Tuesday. The tapes were flown to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last week for analysis at a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> laboratory in <LOCATION> Virgnia </LOCATION>. The analysis has now been flown to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> accompanied by two specialists who will present the analysis to the six-member team of investigators. As the secrecy-shrouded inquiry entered its second week, the focus was on resolving conflicts over the altitude and other details of <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>'s Flight 655 just before the A300 <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> was blown apart over the Strait of <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION> on July 3, killing all 290 people aboard. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the computer analysis could prove crucial in determining whether a misreading of target data by the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>' sophisticated Aegis air defense system led the ship's commander, Capt. <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, to fire at what he believed was an Iranian F-14 fighter. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said the Airbus was emitting a confusing mixture of identification signals, one typical of a commercial airliner and another similar to that which <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ships had received previously from Iranian F-14s. While the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> initially reported the jetliner at about 9,200 feet and descending to about 7,900 feet before it was hit, data from two other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships indicates it was nearer to 12,000 feet and either flying level or climbing, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> were quoted as saying. One of the ships, the frigate <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, was close by at the time the plane was shot down and the other, the missile frigate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sides </PERSON>, was about 17 miles away. Both ships monitored the military radio messages in which, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said, <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> tried repeatedly to make contact with the jetliner, and tracked it on radar. But they did not record the sequence of events on computer tape, said a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> official, who asked not to be named. `` Neither of those ships has anything even close to Aegis, so what they could provide is pretty limited by comparison,'' said the official. The <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, a 3,800-ton frigate designed for anti-submarine warfare, was with the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> during a clash with Iranian gunboats that occurred less than an hour before the <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> plane was shot down. Investigators earlier interviewed officers of all three ships under oath. The <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> remains anchored off <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, but the <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> and the <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sides </PERSON> returned to duty several days ago. The investigators, according to a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> official, are trying to collect anything that has some bearing on the disaster. He said this includes information that only <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> could provide, such as whether a military plane might have played a role in the confusion or warned the Airbus. A senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officer said last week that any direct access to Iranian officals or data appeared `` highly doubtful.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said earlier that an Iranian scout plane, a U.S.-built P-3 Orion, apparently was airborne and could have monitored and relayed the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>' warning messages to the jetliner. Iranian pilots and others have been quoted as saying the pilot of Flight 655 would have been so busy talking with controllers in <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION>, his destination across the gulf, that he would not necessarily have heard the cruiser's radioed warnings on the civilian radio frequency. Iranian officials have not acknowledged that the plane was transmitting a military identification signal on `` Mode 2,'' the frequency reserved for military use, as the Americans claim. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> source said the <ORGANIZATION> IFF </ORGANIZATION>, or identification friend or foe, codes used by Iranian F-14s had been given to the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> by the missile cruiser <PERSON> Wainwright </PERSON>, which the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> replaced on gulf duty in late May. The Airbus' flight recorder also could provide important clues to the plane's altitude and other details, but <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s navy commander, Rear Adm. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hossein </PERSON> <PERSON> Malekzadegan </PERSON>, said on Monday there was no truth to reports that it had been recovered.

<HEAD>Reagan Promises To Work Hard For Weapons Sale To Kuwait</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> assured <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s prime minister Tuesday that he will continue to push for a proposed sale of Maverick missiles to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> state. Posing for photographers as he met with Crown <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> and Prime Minister <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Saad </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Abudllah </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` You bet we're going to fight for it. We want very much to complete that.'' Asked if there was any chance of success, he replied, `` I think so.'' Last week, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted to strip the <ORGANIZATION> Mavericks </ORGANIZATION> from a $ 1.8 billion arms package that included 40 F-18 fighter-bombers for the tiny oil-rich gulf country. Critics contended the missiles could be turned against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in the event of a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. But a senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, briefing reporters in advance of <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Saad </PERSON>'s visit, said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> still would retain a strategic edge over any combination of hostile Arab countries, even if the purchase were approved. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted against the <ORGANIZATION> Mavericks </ORGANIZATION> in an appropriations amendment that is likely to be approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. That does not kill the sale, however, since arms purchases are considered final unless both the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> reject them down within 30 days after they are formally announced. In his formal remarks at a departure ceremony for the first <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> leader to visit here in 20 years, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` We strongly support the request for F-18 aircraft and accompanying weapons now pending before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Skeik </PERSON> <PERSON> Saad </PERSON>, in his response, thanked <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support. He said <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> was grateful for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s willingness to escort its oil tankers in the war-torn <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, and said `` we appreciate the effective role of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as a superpower in resolving issues of world peace. ...'' A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, describing the talks Tuesday on condition of anonymity, quoted <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as telling <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Saad </PERSON>, `` We will keep pitching for F-18s.'' The official said both the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> consider the Maverick missiles part of `` an integrated package'' and want it to stay that way. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> concluded a weapons deal with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> over the weekend, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have expressed concern about <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> allies turning to other countries to obtain armaments. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> agreed to buy sophisticated weaponry from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> after a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sales package ran into congressional opposition. The administration officials said the Kuwaitis clearly `` have the means'' to purchase weapons through other channels if they wish.

 Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is `` more a plus than he is a minus'' on women's issues, but his stance on Contra aid and defense spending could alienate women voters in November, women's groups said Tuesday The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator, Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' running mate choice, offers a mixed record that could turn some women voters to Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, especially if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> picks a female running mate, said <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Yard </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION>. `` If you're a Democrat it's very worrisome,'' she said. Polls have shown that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is troubled by a `` gender gap'' that has many women leaning toward the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate in the presidential race. But the choice of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> does n't solidify the women's vote in the Democratic column, the groups said. NOW and the bipartisan National Women's Political Caucus rated <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s record as generally good, based on his support during the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of civil rights legislation, Medicaid funding for abortion in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> and his opposition to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> nomination of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> has also supported the Equal Rights Amendment. `` Basically, he's more a plus than he is a minus,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Yard </PERSON>. `` I think the one thing that disturbs us about him is that he is very much a hawk. He was pro-Contra aid, and for all the money spent on defense. He is really business as usual and that's why the voters want change.'' Women are more strongly opposed to defense spending and to <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> aid, she said, because they `` want this world to turn into a world of negotiation and stop this nonsense about fighting.'' <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> Natividad </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION>, said women's groups had not expected this year that <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> would name a woman vice president candidate because `` the sense was that the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> felt they had already done a women on the ticket.'' <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>, who was <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>'s running mate on the losing Democratic ticket in 1984, said she was `` delighted'' by the choice of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. She said she was not disappointed a man had been chosen, since there were not enough women in national political office to provide <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with a good choice for a female running mate. `` If we had a woman in that <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat or in the statehouse that had the credentials that Senator <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> has, I, of course, would be disappointed. But because we do n't have a woman in that spot, I am not,'' she said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> `` has been fine on issues that I and many women care about and in addition to that he's going to be a very strong help to the ticket, rounding it out beautifully so that with a Democrat in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> it's going to make a difference for the women in this country.'' Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, D-Colo., who explored the possibility of running for president in 1988, said that problems with the economy are more likely to make women vote Democratic and that <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, as head of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, offered strong credentials on that issue `` All the gender gap polling is showing that women are truly understanding what's wrong with the economy because they're the ones out there trying to juggle two jobs. They're going to be very pleased with <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>,'' she said. `` The real gender gap is generated from women struggling to meet the family budget every month. Somehow I do n't think they're going to see <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as identifying with that problem,'' she said.

 Agriculture and weather service officials said Tuesday this week's rain eased the drought in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> but not in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, while <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> officials pleaded for more water-hauling trucks to help people whose wells have run dry. In <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, a state environmental official said the Bay State was not in the same condition as the drought-stricken <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> but noted a drop in July's rainfall and urged conservation. In <LOCATION> Johnson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, the public library canceled its annual worm race because the critters have burrowed deeper into the soil in search of moisture. Showers and thunderstorms dampened parts of the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> into southern and eastern <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and across southern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and southern <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. A flash flood watch was posted for parts of north central <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> after heavy overnight rain. Farmers in southern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> reported 24-hour rainfall ranging from 0.2 to nearly 4 inches, but agriculture officials said more was needed to offset dry conditions. `` Everything looks so good with a bit of rain over the past 24 hours,'' said <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Quoin </PERSON> farmer <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Krone </PERSON>, whose 2,800-acre farm President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> plans to visit Thursday during a tour of the drought-ravaged area. However, <PERSON> Krone </PERSON> noted, almost one-third of his 1,200 acres of corn already have been lost. In <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said scattered showers in the last week have had virtually no impact. Conditions in southwestern <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> were rated extreme, the worst category listed under the index used to measure drought severity. In the northeastern part of the state, conditions are rated severe, the next-highest category, the service said. At least 50 truckloads of hay gathered from the <LOCATION> Carolinas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> are being shipped to <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> on Thursday in a drive organized by the <ORGANIZATION> Charlotte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Speedway </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Car </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Racing </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disaster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> issued a plea Tuesday for more water-hauling trucks to help people whose wells have dried up. The heaviest concentration of homes in need of water are in extreme northern <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, just south of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, according to agency spokesman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>. Rain Monday and Tuesday was the first significant rainfall <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> has had since early June but was `` far from a salvation,'' according to <PERSON> Krit </PERSON> <PERSON> Stubblefield </PERSON>, a spokesman for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>. The showers came too late to save corn but could buy more time for soybeans and tobacco, he said. In <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, state Environmental Affairs Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyte </PERSON> noted that the state's largest reservoir system was 13 feet below its usual level and called for increased water conservation. `` We are taking out of the reservoir far more than nature can replenish,'' said <PERSON> Hoyte </PERSON>, noting that rainfall for July is only one-quarter of the average rainfall for the month. In northeastern <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> ordered the city of <LOCATION> Toccoa </LOCATION> to impose an immediate ban on outdoor watering. City officials had asked for an exemption from state-mandated water restrictions because they believed a new $ 3 million project to draw water from <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yonah </LOCATION> had made the city virtually `` drought-proof.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Gwinnett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> agreed to pay a $ 75,000 state fine for exceeding its June allocation of water from <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanier </LOCATION>, but refused to enact tougher outdoor watering restrictions for county residents. <PERSON> Gwinnett </PERSON>, northeast of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, is one of the country's fastest-growing areas.

 Former <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, picked by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to head the troubled <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, pledged Tuesday to `` follow the evidence wherever it may lead'' in the matter of outgoing Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> declined to answer questions about <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> in any detail, however, in an appearance in the White House briefing room with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who announced the nomination and urged swift confirmation by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The administration will be in office for only six more months. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s nomination will be sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> during the week of July 25, when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will be back from a weeklong recess that begins Friday so that members can attend the Democratic National Convention Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, the senior Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said that he hoped hearings would `` begin right away'' and added that they can `` if the Democrats do n't delay the matter.'' Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, the No. 2 Democrat on the committee, which will review <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s nomination, said he expected a rapid confirmation. `` I have the greatest respect for <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. `` The state of justice in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> would be very different today if <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> had been attorney general for the past 3 -LCB- years instead of <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>.'' Although no date has been set for a confirmation hearing, a staff source at the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, `` It's reasonable to assume'' a hearing will be held in early August, with a full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote by Aug. 12. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> begins a three-week recess after Aug. 12. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> himself was enthusiastic about <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s choice of <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>. `` I think it's excellent. I had the opportunity to talk in some detail with the president about the various candidates and I think <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> is actually at the top of the list,'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> said. `` He's an outstanding person and I'm sure he'll do an excellent job,'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, 55, had been mentioned as a possible running mate for Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the likely Republican presidential nominee. And since <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s name surfaced on Monday as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s probable choice for the attorney general's job, there was talk that the former <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> governor would be kept in the Justice post during a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was consulted about the nomination. On the question of whether <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> would remain as attorney general if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> were elected president, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said, `` I think it's premature to even speculate about that.'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> himself said only that <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> `` will be an outstanding attorney general, just as he was an outstanding governor. I strongly support his nomination.'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> was asked if he expected to remain after January in the event of a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> victory. `` I obviously ca n't speak for the vice president,'' he replied. `` But I think that law enforcement is a 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week proposition. And whether you're on the job for six days or six months or six years, it is a full-time effort. ... `` <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, whose affairs have been under investigation by independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>, announced last week that he would resign by early August. Both <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> have said that they believe <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s 830-page report, which has been filed in court but not made public, vindicated the attorney general. Among the matters <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> probed were <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s assistance to <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, defense contractor under investigation for payoffs to win government contracts; <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s actions in connection with a proposed $ 1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline project; and whether he took actions favorable to regional <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> telephone companies at a time he held $ 14,000 in telephone stock. When asked whether he planned to look into the Meese matter, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said, `` I really ca n't answer any substantive questions at this time.'' `` My intention, and this is in any area, is to follow the evidence wherever it may lead,'' he said. `` And not knowing what that evidence is, I ca n't give you a prediction.'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> could still face an internal department review of his actions. Portions of <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>'s sealed report are said to question <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s candor and ethics. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had given <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> no advice on the issue. `` Those matters are all left to the incoming attorney general,'' the spokesman said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> called <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> `` the ideal choice for attorney general,'' saying that in six years as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney for western <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, he was `` a prosecutor's prosecutor ... a tough-minded crime buster.'' `` I urge the Senate to move quickly to confirm him as well as our other <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> nominees so they can roll up their sleeves and get to work enforcing the laws of the land,'' the president said. Also awaiting <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation are the deputy attorney general, <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON>; the No. 3 person in the department, Associate Attorney General <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>; and the criminal division chief, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> have been on the job since early June; <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> has been at work about a month longer. All were appointed on an acting basis by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Christensen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> are replacing former Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>, whose protest resignations March 29 over <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s continued tenure brought accusations of a serious leadership gap in the department.

<HEAD>Cities Increased Fees, Raised Taxes In Face Of Federal Aid
Cutbacks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN PUTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's cities, encumbered by burgeoning budget gaps spawned by federal aid cutbacks, sharply increased local fees this fiscal year and many also raised property taxes, a study reported Tuesday. Over half the country's major cities face potential deficits, although some will be able to dip into reserves to avoid finishing the year in the red, said the study by the National League of Cities. `` The present trends are dangerous and potentially devastating,'' said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Beals </PERSON>, executive director of the league, a national organization of local governments. <PERSON> Beals </PERSON> called the nation's domestic policies on cities `` indifferent at best and destructive at worst.'' The league report, titled `` City Fiscal Conditions in 1988,'' describes how 347 communities _ from large cities such as <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to smaller towns like <LOCATION> Yankton </LOCATION>, S.D. _ are coping with the end, two years ago, of the federal revenue sharing program. The survey found that 67 percent increased existing fees and charges for city services in the 1988 fiscal year, while 44 percent reduced spending this year on capital construction projects. Fifty-five percent cut back the growth of their operating budgets and 41 percent raised property taxes. Those figures were higher than 1987, when 58 percent raised fees and 38 percent raised property taxes over the year before. In addition, 37 percent of the cities said they had instituted new fees. Another 14 percent reduced city services. Cities overwhelmingly cited federal cutbacks as the reason for their budgetary straits. Almost half of the cities that cut services said less federal money was the main reason, and 64 percent of those who scaled back capital projects cited the loss of revenue sharing. `` The backbone of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> _ our cities and towns _ is bending under an increasing load,'' <PERSON> Beals </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` Whether this burden will continue to grow more cumbersome, or whether it will be relieved through a more responsible set of national policies is one of the urgent questions of the 1988 elections and for the next administration,'' <PERSON> Beals </PERSON> said at a news conference on the report. The news conference was held as word came that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, had picked Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> as his running mate. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> heads the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and has worked with the league on a number of issues affecting the nation's cities, <PERSON> Beals </PERSON> noted. `` We found him to be very open-minded and responsive -LRB- and he has -RRB- given us a very sympathetic hearing,'' <PERSON> Beals </PERSON> said. The report measured spending estimates for the 1988 fiscal year _ the 12-month period that ended June 30 _ which the report acknowledged are not yet final. It said 50 percent of the cities expect expenditures to exceed revenues in 1988, but noted that cities usually are pessimistic in such projections. The actual percentage of cities that finish their fiscal years with deficits is expected to be lower, since municipalities facing shortfalls dip into reserves carried over from previous years to balance their budgets, the report said. In 1987, 33 percent of the cities surveyed by the league actually reported shortfalls, down from 40 percent in 1986. More than half those cities had surpluses in 1986 and 1987, but only 24 percent said they expect to take in more than they spend in the 1988 fiscal year. The survey also found that 25 percent of the cities had actually seen revenues from all sources decline in 1988 from last year. In other areas of spending, the survey found that 25 percent of the cities had reduced the number of city workers, 24 percent had raised or imposed new fees for developers and 22 percent had frozen municipal hiring. Eighteen percent had instituted new taxes or raised sales taxes.

<HEAD>Inmates Trick Guards With Dummies In Beds</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Four inmates, two of them convicted murderers, escaped a maximum-security prison after tricking guards by putting dummies made from stuffed long johns in their cots, authorities said Tuesday. Guards twice counted the dummies during overnight bed checks, said prison spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>. The inmates went to a laundry area, slid down a homemade rope, and moved along a shallow ditch along a fence not visible from the guard tower, he said. `` At the 7 a.m. count, when there was n't any movement, they were discovered missing,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. It was the first escape from the Maximum Security Unit at <LOCATION> Tucker </LOCATION>, in central <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, about 30 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>. <PERSON> White </PERSON> said the dummies were made of white thermal underwear stuffed with blankets. The heads were made of white stocking caps with pieces of human hair taped to them. Two of the four worked in the laundry room, he said. Sgt. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Correction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said all the inmates were in individual cells. The escapees were identified as convicted murderers <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Renton </PERSON>, 50, and <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Coble </PERSON>, 29; <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Winberry </PERSON>, 38, convicted of two counts of attempted murder, and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Fane </PERSON>, 31, convicted of aggravated robbery and other crimes. <PERSON> Coble </PERSON> and <PERSON> Winberry </PERSON> escaped from another state prison in November 1986, <PERSON> White </PERSON> said, but were recaptured a short time later. Authorities were using an airplane, dogs and a roadblock in their search for the escaped inmates.

<TEXT>
 Ambassador <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Melton </PERSON>, who was ordered by the Nicaraguan government to leave the country, is believed to be the fifth <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat of his rank to be withdrawn at the request of the host government over the past 15 years. Earlier this year, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hume </PERSON> <PERSON> Horan </PERSON>, was recalled by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because of personality differences with King Fahd. Unlike <PERSON> Melton </PERSON>, however, <PERSON> Horan </PERSON> was not declared persona non grata but <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> authorities made clear the monarch's displeasure with <PERSON> Horan </PERSON>, who spent only seven months in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. Within days after <PERSON> Horan </PERSON>'s recall, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> nominated Ambassador <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cutler </PERSON> to replace him. The case involving <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> is believed to be the first of its kind since 1976 when the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Equatorial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Spiro </PERSON>, was ordered out of the country. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> relations with <LOCATION> Equatorial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION> were poor at the time because of unpredictable behavior of President <PERSON> Masie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nguema </PERSON> and other factors. During that period, <PERSON> Spiro </PERSON> was the accredited ambassador to both <LOCATION> Cameroon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Equatorial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION> but resided in <LOCATION> Cameroon </LOCATION>. He made occasional visits to <LOCATION> Equatorial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION>. Full relations with that country were not restored until 1979. In 1975, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinton </PERSON>, was expelled by President <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sese </PERSON> <PERSON> Seko </PERSON> for alleged interference in <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>'s internal affairs In 1973, Jamaican Prime Minister <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> expelled Ambassador <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Deroulet </PERSON> after the envoy had said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> refrained from interfering in the 1972 national elections in <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> in return for a promise from <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> not to nationalize certain <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> business investments in <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Manley </PERSON> denied the allegation.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> today called the selection of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> as <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' running mate `` a strategic move'' and said `` I'm too controlled ... to be angry'' at being passed over. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he will support the ticket nominated at the Democratic National Convention next week but brushed off questions about whether he will campaign enthusiastically for the party. `` The approach he used today was of course a matter of his own campaign making a strategic move to solidify his organization. That is his right to do,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said at a news conference. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he first learned of the selection from reporters who met him at an airport here this morning. He said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> later phoned him, but they did not have a lengthy discussion. Asked if he was angry, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> replied: `` No, I'm too controlled, I'm too clear, I'm too mature to be angry. I'm focused on what we must do to keep hope alive ...'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> nearly crossed paths at the airport with <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, who was preparing to leave for <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. The two did not meet. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> declined comment on most of the questions he was asked by reporters as he walked to his car at <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s National Airport. When asked if <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had informed him of a decision, he said, `` No.'' The night before, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> stated publicly for the first time that he would accept the No. 2 spot on the Democratic ticket and said he assured <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' talent scout that he would be a loyal vice president. But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> stopped short Monday night of pledging loyalty if he is not chosen for the ticket. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told reporters that would depend on discussions yet to be held between him and the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, the certain nominee when <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> convene in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> next week. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> met with reporters after a two-hour private session here Monday as <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> neared the end of the running mate search for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who has said repeatedly he had earned serious consideration for the No. 2 spot, previously had demurred at saying whether he would accept a bid. He joked to a farm group before the job interview, `` So far <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has not accepted my offer and I have not refused his.'' But there were no jokes after the session with <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s second interview for the job. `` If it was offered to me, I would accept it,'' he said. `` If it's not offered to me, then how I respond will be based upon many things that we've not yet discussed.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who technically remains in contention for the Democratic nomination even though <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has a numerical lock on a first-ballot victory at the convention, said, `` We intend to have an effective, informative convention that would inspire our nation, unify our party and take us to victory.'' He said they did not discuss outstanding differences on the party platform. He said he gave <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> `` my candid views as to the office of the vice presidency and shared with him, when asked, what I thought my qualifications to be and my vision of that role.'' <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> called it `` an excellent meeting ... very productive. It served the purpose for which it was intended, and that is to continue and to conclude the background check phase of the selection process.'' <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON>, who flew back to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> Monday night, said, `` I plan to review my meeting with Reverend <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> with the governor, and then it's up to the governor.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, who took part in the meeting, told reporters that although <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> did not say when <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would announce his decision, `` I got the impression it was going to be very soon ... in the next couple of days.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, asked to rate his chances, said, `` There is no way of judging that.'' Asked if the interview could have been a charade, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said: `` I have no basis to challenge the intergrity of Mr. <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> or Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. If this is just a charade, it is a great waste of their time, at a time when time is precious.'' Asked if he would consider having his name placed in nomination for vice president if <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> chooses someone else, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, `` That's not under consideration.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, asked if <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> had asked him to promise loyalty to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, said: `` He did ask it. The answer is yes because that's the right thing to do. But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> made clear he was only talking about loyalty as a running mate. He said they talked about not only the requirements of the vice presidency, but `` the latitude. No one, of course, would be asked to do anything illegal or unconstitutional.'' `` So long as there is room for serious discussion, debate and deliberation, maturity requires that you agree to agree -LRB- and -RRB- that you agree to disagree. ... `` said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. On `` your best day, your point of view may prevail. At your worst, your point of view simply may be a matter of influence. `` I'm one to support the party. I've done that down through the years.'' Earlier, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, `` If I am not on the team, then the governor must determine who the team members are and what role they will play.'' He said he was seeking `` a partnership of equity and shared responsibility.'' Asked how his followers would respond if he is left off the ticket, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said: `` Let's take it one day at a time. My constituency is tough and matured, enduring, loyal but also responsible as it seeks its rightful place in our party's leadership It has earned partnership in our party.''

But <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s wins cost Democrats the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat. Republican <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> later won a special election for the post, which is still held by the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>. If <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> wins both races this year, his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat would become vacant in January. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON>, a Republican, would then appoint a replacement to serve until a special election. <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> also would set the special election day. Under state law, that election could be on May 7, Aug. 13 or Nov. 12. Secretary of State <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Rains </PERSON> said <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> also could set an emergency election on any date he chooses, but that move would have to be cleared by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Rains said it usually takes 70 days to get <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> approval for emergency elections. He also said the `` law is silent'' on any deadline for calling the special election. <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> could wait as long as he pleased to set it, according to Rains. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s November <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> opponent is <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Beau </PERSON> <PERSON> Boulter </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Amarillo </LOCATION>, who has said it would not be fair for <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> to make both races. But <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Weeks </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Bentsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> campaign, said that is just what <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> will do. `` He is going to run a vigorous campaign for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>,'' Weeks said. If he beats <PERSON> Boulter </PERSON> and also wins the vice presidency, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat would be vacant sometime in January He could choose to take the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> oath on Jan. 3 and then resign his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat when he takes the vice presidential oath on Jan. 20. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> could also opt to skip the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> oath, in which case the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat would be open Jan. 3. The special <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> election would be open to all candidates. The 1960 race drew 70 contenders. Tower won a runoff over <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Blakley </PERSON>, who had been appointed interim senator by then-Democratic Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Connally </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrats are confident they could hold the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat if <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> becomes vice president, especially if the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket carries <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> in November. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator is <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, a Republican who won the seat in 1984 after Tower retired.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> flatly rejected on Tuesday a proposal by Soviet General Secretary <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> for a meeting of European leaders to achieve movement on reducing conventional arms. Spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> called it `` an attempt to divert attention from the business at hand.'' She also criticized, less harshly, an offer to scale down air forces in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> if <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> agreed to forgo the redeployment of 72 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> jet fighter planes in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said reducing forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> was a subject for consideration by the 16-member <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance and not for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to decide on their own. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> made the two proposals Monday in a speech to the Polish parliament in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. The swift <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> response reflected an unwillingness to explore new approaches with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in preference to ongoing multinational negotiations in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> and proposed bloc-to-bloc talks. `` We see little utility in proposing a new, different form,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> negotiations have not produced troop reductions. New negotiations are supposed to be held between the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> in the Austrian capital, but a date has not been set. The key problem appears to be a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demand that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> simultaneously considers improving its human rights record. Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON>, reading from a prepared statement, said `` vast conventional superiority'' of the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> over <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> was the cause of security problems in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` The first step toward rectifying this imbalance is to reach East-West agreement on a negotiating mandate for new arms control talks covering <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact conventional forces from the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Ural </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>,'' she said. `` Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s proposal is an attempt to divert attention from the business at hand in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. If the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is sincere in its pursuit of conventional reductions it will work in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> to achieve a muitally acceptable mandate and a balanced outcome ...'' At the same time, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman criticized <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s suggestion that the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact would consider withdrawing `` analogus air force units'' from <LOCATION> Eeastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> if <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> aggreed to drop plans to move 72 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> F-16 warplanes to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, where they were ordered to leave over three years. `` A matter of common alliance concern will not be undertaken on a bilateral basis,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said. `` We are prepared to give serious consideration to any proposal that will enhance the common goal of enhancing stability in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' She drew attention to a statement by <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the new Secretary General of NAT0, rejecting the proposal. He said the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance was concerned mostly with reducing land forces. `` On their own, aircraft do not capture and hold territory.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Fourth of July was a day for flags, fireworks and apple pie, but not for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s favorite pastime, at least not on TV. According to figures from the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Monday Night Baseball'' scored its lowest rating ever, a 5.9 and a 14 share on July 4. The <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cardinals </ORGANIZATION> played the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dodgers </ORGANIZATION>. Television audience levels are traditionally low on the Fourth of July, because many viewers are outside celebrating the holiday. With the movie `` Bull Durham'' a hit at the box office, fictional baseball was big on the small screen, though. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> reran the theatrical film `` The Natural'' on Sunday night, and it ranked seventh with a 15.5 rating and 29 share. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s real-life game Friday night between the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mets </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Astros </ORGANIZATION> did n't do much better than <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s, ranking 55th with a rating of 6.4 and 14 share. The pre-game show was the lowest-rated show of the week. But <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> won the week ending July 10 with an average, prime-time rating of 11.5 and a 23 share. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> was second with an 8.9. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> had an 8.6. Indicative of low holiday viewing of the networks, their combined share was down to 58, compared with the 69 that is the average for the season-to-date. Bad news for the networks was good news for the <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, whose No. 1 show, `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Most Wanted,'' had a record 14 share. The rating was 6.7. The show ranked 51st, the highest <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> ranking for a Fox series. For the week ending July 10, The `` CBS Evening News'' was first among the network newscasts with a rating of 9.6 and a 22 share. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` World News Tonight'' had an 8.9 and 20. After three weeks in second place, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> dropped back to third with an 8.3 and 19. The rating is a percentage of the nation's estimated 88.6 million households with televisions. The share is a percentage of sets in use. The highest-rated prime-time show of the week was <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Night Court,'' with a 17.1 rating and 31 share. The rest of the top 10 were: `` A Different World,'' `` Cheers,'' `` The Cosby Show,'' `` Golden Girls,'' `` <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION> Law,'' `` The Natural,'' all on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, followed by `` 60 Minutes'' and `` Murder, She Wrote'' on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, then <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>.'' In a week with only 11 shows out of 76 that were n't reruns, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s news documentary `` Guns, Guns Guns'' was ranked 21st with a rating of 11.1 and a 20 share. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> repeated its documentary `` Drugs: A Plague Upon the Land'' on Saturday and landed in 41st place with a rating of 8.3 and a 17 share. The documentary was repeated to set the stage for a follow-up program on Monday. The lowest-rated shows of the week were: `` Rags to Riches,'' `` <ORGANIZATION> Kane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Abel </PERSON>, Part 2,'' `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> vs. <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>,'' `` The Pretenders,'' `` High Mountain Rangers,'' `` <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> vs. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>,'' `` Hothouse,'' `` Spot Marks the X, Part 2,'' `` Supercarrier'' and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s baseball pre-game show.

<HEAD>Deaver Sentencing Set For Sept. 23</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Former White House aide <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> was ordered Tuesday to appear Sept. 23 to be sentenced for lying to a grand jury and a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee about his lobbying business. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Penfield </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also scheduled a Sept. 15 hearing to take testimony about <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON>'s problems with alcohol, which the defense contended impaired the former presidential aide's memory he gave sworn testimony two years ago. Testimony about <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON>'s alcoholism would be offered by the defense in an attempt to show there were mitigating circumstances that would warrant a short sentence or probation. The hearing promises to be the first full airing of the alcoholism issue, which was never raised during the trial because <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON>'s lawyers rested their case without calling any witnesses. A recovering alcoholic, <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> was convicted Dec. 16, 1987 on three counts of lying to a grand jury and a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommitee about the lobbying business he formed in 1985 after resigning as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s deputy chief of staff. <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON>, who was questioned by the panels about allegations that his lobbying of former government colleagues violated federal conflict-of-interest laws, could be sentenced up to five years in prison for each of the perjury convictions. The sentencing was stayed on Feb. 2 after a federal appeals court struck down the independent counsel law under which <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> was prosecuted. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s 7-1 decision last month upholding the constitutionality of court-appointed independent counsels set the stage for <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> to be sentenced. During a brief hearing on the case, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Braga </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON>'s lawyers, told <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> that the defense wanted to present testimony from the head of an alcoholism rehabilitation clinic in Havre de Grace, Md. where <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> spent 30 days in 1985. <PERSON> Braga </PERSON> said <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON>'s doctor at <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> would also be called to testify about the former presidential aide's treatment for the disease earlier that year. The defense has contended in court papers that <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON>'s memory was impaired by his bout with alcoholism and therefore he was n't lying when he testified that he could n't recall making certain lobbying contacts During the trial, <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON>'s lawyers rested their case without presenting witnesses, including doctors who treated him for alcoholism. Several former employees of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> & amp; <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, who appeared as prosecution witnesses, testified during cross-examination that <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> suffered memory lapses and moodiness which they later attributed to alcoholism. But the judge instructed jurors to disregard this testimony, saying it was speculative and self-serving. Independent counsel <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> told the judge he might call a medical expert to rebut testimony given by <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON>'s witnesses <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON>'s hospitalization for alcoholism in June, 1985 is a period cited by the defense as a time when his memory was impaired by alcoholic withdrawal and sedation. Several telephone calls <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> made to government officials, including one to then-Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, took place while the former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide was in the hospital. <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> was found guilty of lying to the grand jury when he testified: `` I do n't recall any government contact I made'' on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Cuauhtemoc Cardenas: Famous Name, Charismatic Campaign</HEAD>
<HEAD>With Mexico-Election, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CANDICE HUGHES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Although he may lose the election, opposition candidate <PERSON> Cuauhtemoc </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> appears to have secured a position as the rallying point for the discontent with the party that has ruled <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> for 59 years. Whether he won the presidential election or not is still a matter of heated debate. He says he did, the governing <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>, says he did n't. Privately, top <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> officials admit <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> won the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>, the core of the sprawling <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> metropolitan area, and three of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s 31 states. Even those victories would be a stunning blow to the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>, which has won every presidential race since its founding in 1929 with at least 70 percent of the vote, and never has lost a senate or gubernatorial race. <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> claimed Monday he won 39 percent of the vote nationwide to <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>'s 35 percent. After a week's delay and opposition charges of fraud, the government has only provided partial returns on the race for the lower house of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Figures released Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> say <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> had 53.59 percent of the votes counted. <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> was second with 26.08 percent, and <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON> of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> followed with 16.04 percent. Even these figures, which the opposition disputes, would be an astonishing feat for <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>, a candidate who in December started to build his predominantly leftist coalition from a tiny base. His campaign was considered unlikely to shake the foundations of power, and ruling politicians dismissed him as a candidate of `` nostalgia'' who was trading on his famous name. Through it all, the charismatic candidate never lost his composure. Before hundreds of thousands of adoring supporters on the campaign trail, in the steamy battle over vote fraud, at middle-of-the-night news conferences in the days-long wait for the returns, he was always calm, always reasonable. While <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON> barreled down the campaign trail, blustering about civil disobedience, <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> quietly counseled restraint and spoke of using the force of law. <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>, 54, spent the day before the election in the central state of <LOCATION> Michoacan </LOCATION>, where he once was the governing <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>'s governor. He was n't basking in the warmth accorded a favorite son. He was mourning his old friend and political strategist, <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Xavier </PERSON> <PERSON> Ovando </PERSON>, gunned down while on the way home from a political strategy session. `` <PERSON> Xavier </PERSON> has fallen because he was fighting for <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to have a true and authentic democracy,'' <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> said. `` He died because he dreamed of a better, an independent and a free <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>.'' That moment was like a snapshot capturing the campaign and the candidate. <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> was criticized for wanting to turn the clock back to 1910, when the Mexican Revolution started with the promise of a better life, or to 1938, when his father, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s revered 20th century president, nationalized <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s oil and handed the young republic its pride. But the <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> message was n't about the nuts and bolts of governing. It was visceral: He became a focal point of discontent with a system that seemed calcified by nearly 60 years of single-party rule. It was an ironic role for politician who once seemed to be the ultimate product of a system his father, the late President <PERSON> Lazaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>, helped create. <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> flourished in the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>. He was its governor in <LOCATION> Michoacan </LOCATION> and also a senator. The break started last year when <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> seemed to sense the growing force of a cold wind of disfavor that was about to blast the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>. Calling his movement the Democratic Current, he told the party to hold a presidential primary. The traditionalists in the party refused and <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> defected, forming a left-of-center coalition, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. When he decided to run for president he campaigned virtually without a critical forum _ television. TV in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is government-controlled or pro-government. But as he traveled the nation, he gathered larger and larger crowds, winning the support of peasants, students, the struggling middle class, intellectuals and oil workers. About a month before the election, he did what was considered impossible _ he unified the left. The candidate of the <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the largest organized leftist force, dropped out and endorsed <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>. No one knows if that political unity will survive once the campaign passions cool. But <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> now appears to command a popular force the governing party can not ignore.

<TEXT>
 The last time a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Democrat invited a Texan to be his running mate, he did n't think the offer would be accepted. And after <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> took him up on it, a shocked <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> asked his brother, `` Now what do we do?'' That set <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and his brother <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>, his campaign manager and closest confidant in that 1960 election, to agonizing over how to uninvite the proud, powerful and feared <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> majority leader. In the end, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> ran with <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and narrowly won the 1960 election. Like every Democrat who won the presidency since <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> became a state, he had the votes from the Lone Star State. Twenty-eight years later, in a lengthy and more deliberative process, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, the putative presidential nominee of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> once again has turned to a Texan, Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, to be his vice president. `` <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> beat that incumbent vice president in 1960, and <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> are going to beat them in 1988,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said as he made known his choice of a running mate. Echoed <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>: `` The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> axis was good for the country and good for the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in 1960 and it's going to be a real winner in November of 1988. Just as it did in 1960, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' rich harvest of electoral votes and the advantage of having a southerner on the ticket played a part in <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' decision. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, according to many accounts, gave no thought at all during his campaign for the nomination as to who would run with him. But after the delegates in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> convention chose him, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> had only a few hours to make his pick. He told his brother `` how terrible it was that he only had 24 hours to select a vice president.'' On returning to the rented apartment where he was staying, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> found `` the warmest and most cordial telegram of congratulations'' from <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, according to <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, in his classic `` The Making of the President 1960.'' `` Until that moment <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> had accepted at face value <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s statement that he would never, never, never, trade his senatorial vote for the vice presidential gavel,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> wrote <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said his brother told him he would offer the nomination to <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> first thing the next morning. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> went to see the senator. `` I was in his room when he came back,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> said in a 1965 interview with historian <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON>. `` And he said, ` You just wo n't believe it.' `` I said, ` What?' `` And he said, ` He wants it.' `` And I said, ` Oh, my God!' `` He said, ` Now what do we do?''' `` We spent the rest of the day _ and we both promised each other that we'd never tell what happened ... alternating between thinking it was good and thinking that it was n't good that he'd offered him the vice presidency and how he could get out of it,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. `` One of the major factors ultimately that persuaded him that he should take him was the fact that he would be so mean as majority leader that it was much better having him as vice president, where you could control him, than to have him as majority leader. Particularly after you had offered him the job, then it would have been disastrous to have that affront and withdraw it.'' The two <PERSON> Kennedys </PERSON> decided to try and have <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> take himself out. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> said he made two trips to <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s hotel room. On the first, he said, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s close friend, House Speaker <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Rayburn </PERSON>, was there and <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> only tried to feel <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> out. But, like everything else about that time, there are different versions of that meeting. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, the late publisher of the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> who was close to <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, recalled these events in a famous memorandum that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> recently studied during his search for a vice president. `` <ORGANIZATION> LBJ </ORGANIZATION> seemed about to jump out of his skin,'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> wrote of the first Lyndon-Bobby meeting. `` He shouted at me that <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> had just come in and told <PERSON> Rayburn </PERSON> and him that there was such opposition and that <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> should withdraw for the sake of the party.'' On the second visit, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said, he and <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> were alone. It was 2:30 p.m. on the last day of the convention. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> said he conveyed two thoughts he'd worked out with his brother. That there would be an unpleasant fight by labor leaders if <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> were on the ticket and that <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> wanted him to play an important role, running the party, and thereby build the machinery he could use to run for president in 1968. `` I do n't know whether it was just an act or anything,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> told <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON>. `` But he just shook, and tears came into his eyes, and he said, ` I want to be vice president, and if the president will have me, I'll join with him in making a fight for it.' `` I said, ` well, that's fine. He wants you to be vice president if you want to be vice president, we want you to know.''' At this point, too, there are conflicting accounts. <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> remembered returning to his brother who said he had been advised that vaccilation on the vice president was disastrous and that he would announce <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> as the choice. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Deal </LOCATION> lawyer in <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s camp recalled that at the end of the first meeting <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> called <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> who told him: `` <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON>'s not up to date, I've already announced that <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> is the candidate.'

 Sixteen lawyers for people and companies in the defense procurement probe are demanding that the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> launch an investigation into the sources of leaks to the press. A department official said Tuesday it is `` too early'' to decide whether to do so. `` We are writing to you to request that you commence an investigation and take appropriate remedial action to deal with the virtual flood of leaks by <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> employees involved in or privy to the details of the investigation,'' the attorneys said in their unusual letter. One lawyer called the joint effort `` extraordinary.'' The letter, dated July 8 and publicly released Tuesday, was addressed to <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaheen </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Office of Professional Responsibility. It complained that `` frequency and substance of these ` leaks' is ... unprecedented.'' <PERSON> Shaheen </PERSON>, who has responsibility for investigating ethics cases involving <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> employees, refused to comment. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, a department spokesman, said it was `` too early to determine that we will undertake an investigation.'' Several of the defense counsels are former assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys, obviously taking advantage of their knowledge of internal <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> procedures to stop what they feel is a case of government officials trying their case in the newspapers and on television. Justice investigators have `` knowingly ensured dissemination of confidential information and sensationalization of the entire investigation'' by leaking information, the letter said. Such leaks create `` an environment in which our clients can not be dispassionately investigated ...,'' they said. They suggested that <PERSON> Shaheen </PERSON> focus on possible violation of seven statutes, regulations or rules barring <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> employees from revealing unauthorized material. One law carries a fine of up to $ 1,000 and imprisonment of a year for divulging certain material. Other penalties can include a letter of censure or dismissal. Investigations into leaks are not unusual, <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> said. `` At one time, we have anywhere from 10 to 15 leak investigations going on,'' he said. Some of those include improper revelations of classified material. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, who is coordinating the massive probe, also has expressed concern about leaks in the case, which was brought to public attention on June 14. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents conducted surprise searches on more than three dozen homes and offices in 12 states on that day. No one has been charged in the investigation of the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 150 billion-a-year procurement business Indictments are not expected until the end of the year, though grand jury subpoenas have been issued for mid-July. The allegations are that defense consultants, often former military officers, bribed <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials to obtain secret information that gave their employers an edge in obtaining contracts. Some of the information in the case has come from search warrants used by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, as well as from one affidavit released in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The affidavit, which contained information gathered by telephone wiretaps, gave a detailed account of the investigators' case. <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> has argued that the affidavits should remain under seal because defense attorneys could take advantage of gaps in the government's knowledge if the papers are open to public inspection. Several news organizations around the country have filed lawsuits challenging the sealing orders. The defense attorneys also complained that members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have `` quite predictably'' gone public with information provided by <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials. Among the lawyers signing the letter are <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Barcella </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Plotkin </PERSON>, who represent defense consultant <PERSON> Melvyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Schatzow </PERSON>, whose client is <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON>. <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>, a former top <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> official, has been identified as a key player in the investigation; <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON>, a long-time friend of <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>'s since their days at the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, worked as a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> procurement official.

 <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> inspectors confirmed Tuesday they found evidence of corrosion in several of their <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 jetliners years before the April 28 accident in which the top of an Aloha jet ripped off over <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. In one case, a 7 -LCB- - inch crack was found on a sister ship in the same section of fuselage that ripped away in April, leaving a large gaping hole above passengers' heads <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Arii </PERSON>, <PERSON> Aloha </PERSON>'s vice president for quality control and engineering, said the crack was discovered during a routine inspection. Aloha officials blamed the crack on corrosion and said it was promptly repaired. <PERSON> Arii </PERSON>'s comments came during the first of four days of hearings the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> is holding on the safety and maintenance of aging jets. <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> officials said the inquiry was not to assess blame in the <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> incident, but to collect more evidence about the accident, in which 61 of 94 people aboard were hurt and one flight attendant was swept to her death before the damaged craft landed on <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION>. Although one of the two engines had quit, the pilot and co-pilot struggled to control the crippled jet and managed to land it safely 13 minutes later. Representatives of The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and other industry groups also are scheduled to testify. In documents released last month by the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> officials warned Aloha months before the accident to make a thorough structural inspection of the plane involved in the accident and of three other aging 737s. Besides the plane found to have the 7 -LCB- - inch crack, <PERSON> Arii </PERSON> testified that <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> inspectors found some bulges and corrosion in the skin over fuselage joints on a third <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 flown by the airline <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Haueter </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> aerospace engineer, asked whether <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION> inspectors considered these discoveries, which came over the course of several years, significant and a reason to adjust their inspection of the jets. `` I ca n't recollect,'' replied <PERSON> Arii </PERSON>, who did recall the airline using more corrosion inhibitors on the planes during routine maintenance checks. The 7 -LCB- - inch crack found in 1984 `` must have been viewed as an isolated incident by the airline,'' <PERSON> Arii </PERSON> said in response to a question by board of inquiry Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauber </PERSON> <PERSON> Haueter </PERSON> shot back that the crack `` was n't an isolated incident if you looked at the service reports.'' Analyses by <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> engineers found some evidence of corrosion, `` disbonding'' and bulging skin on the surface of the April 28 accident plane where pieces of the fuselage were joined together. That plane had made 89,690 landings, the second highest of any <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 in service. The only plane with more landings, 90,051, also was being flown by <LOCATION> Aloha </LOCATION>. It was taken out of service after the accident.

 Two American helicopters answering a call for help from a tanker exchanged fire with a pair of Iranian speedboats Tuesday in the northern <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military officials reported. They said the helicopters were not damaged and it was not known whether rockets fired by the choppers hit the boats. The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the shooting occurred at about 7 p.m. The helicopters were not identified by type, but descriptions of the incident indicate they were two of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s specially equipped scout aircraft, based on some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships in the gulf. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials refuse to discuss the helicopters or even confirm their presence in the gulf, although the Pentagon disclosed that information last year. It was the second time in less than two weeks that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces went to the aid of a non-U.S. flag vessel under fire by Iranians. The frigate <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> aided a Danish tanker in the southern gulf July 2, driving its attackers away. No casualties were reported in that encounter, which occurred the day before the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missile cruiser <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> shot down an Iranian jetliner over the <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials say the captain thought it was an Iranian F-14 fighter. Pentagon spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that in Tuesday's attack the Iranian boats had been shooting at the 81,282-ton Universal Monarch, which broadcast a distress alert saying it `` was being attacked and was on fire.'' Two helicopters from the missile frigate USS <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> `` were sent out to investigate the ship's Mayday call,'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. `` They were fired on by two small boats that we assume were Iranian. They fired rockets at those small boats.'' `` The military helicopters returned fire with rockets, but we do not yet have any word if there was any damage to the Iranian boats,'' he said. `` The helicopters were not hit by the Iranian fire.'' The military officials in <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> was on a patrol in the northern gulf and the confrontation occurred about 15 miles west of <LOCATION> Farsi </LOCATION> island. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Revolutionary Guards use as a speedboat base for attacks on neutral shipping in the 8-year-old war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Shipping executives said the Universal Monarch, which is <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong-owned </LOCATION> and registered in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, was sailing empty to pick up cargo from the <LOCATION> Khafji </LOCATION> fields, owned jointly by <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. The gunboats attacked the tanker with rocket grenades and set it afire, the American officials said. The <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON>, a 3,600-ton frigate that arrived in the gulf about three weeks ago, was about six miles away. Crewmen put out a fire in the tanker's engine room and there were no casualties, said the shipping executives, who spoke on condition their names not be used. <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said the vessel was flooding, but the shipping executives said it was not serious. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said the <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> offered `` humanitarian assistance,'' but none was required. Under expanded `` rules of engagement'' in effect since May 3, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships in the gulf have been permitted to intervene with force to stop attacks on neutral shipping in international waters, provided they are not carrying war-related materials and asked for assistance. Iranian gunboats had steered clear of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ships, attacking in locations too far away for the Americans to intervene. The July 2 encounter involving the <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> was the first confrontation between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Iranian forces since the policy was broadened. Another on the next day, involving the <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>, led indirectly to the jetliner disaster. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said that clash began when a helicopter from the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> was fired on by Iranian speedboats in the Strait of <LOCATION> Homruz </LOCATION>. In a skirmish that followed, the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> and the <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> sank two boats and damaged one just before the <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> took off from <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> for <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> with 290 people aboard. The attack on the Universal Monarch was the second in a week by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s gunboats, and apparently responded to two <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> raids on Iranian tankers Thursday, the shipping executives said. Elsewhere in the war, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> claimed its forces achieved their fourth major battlefield victory in three months Tuesday by driving Iranian troops out of their last stronghold in southern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> claimed the Iraqis used chemical weapons, killing 25 soldiers and wounding more than 3,600. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, which has acknowledged using such weapons in the past, did not respond.

 <PERSON> Jenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON>, who says she believed <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> commissioners were serious when they named her official astrologer, quit Tuesday because of the commotion her position created. `` I think that maybe they wanted to make fun of me and make me look foolish,'' Ms. <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON> said from her home in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION>. `` I've worked 20 years doing what I'm doing. I'm not foolish. I'm very much a common-sense person `` This is a Pisces town, two fish swimming in opposite directions,'' she said of the northeastern <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> community. `` We do n't need divisions here. We need to come together. I have no wish to upset anyone here. I love my town.'' Ms. <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON> said she mailed the county commission a letter Monday informing them she was quitting the non-paying post. Despite the letter, the commission voted 3-0 Tuesday to rescind the appointment. The incident began when Ms. <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON> went to the newspaper in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION>, a timber and farming community of about 12,000, to tell them the stars were in a great position for the county to obtain federal and state grants. County commissioners read the article and, without Ms. <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON>'s knowledge, voted last week to appoint her to help find the right time to make their applications. At the time, County Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, who heads the commission, said, `` What the heck, if the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is rumored as using astrology, I guess we can try it on the local level as well.'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said he was surprised by the publicity. `` I viewed it as tongue-in-cheek,'' he said. `` It was just kind of a gesture to lighten things up and create some conversation. Ms. <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON>, 38, who reads palms and develops astrological charts for a living, said she has plenty of business, thanks to the unexpected publicity. She said she also would like to do astrological charts for communities and states as a public service. She threw in her assessment of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. `` Oregon is an Aquarius state and has a peculiar chart,'' she said. `` Ours is not an easy destiny. We are trend setters for the nation. People will laugh at us, make fun of us and for 50 years they'll be following our trends.'' Next spring, she said, the stars will be favorable for the state improving its education system. The nation, however, is headed for tougher times, she said. `` We've got major, hairy, hairy aspects coming up beginning in March of 1989.''

 `` I'm a fellow born on a dirt road in a cottage down in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said Tuesday. But he does n't look it. Six feet one or two, trim, silver-haired and adroit, he looks more like <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> wealth, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oil and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> slick than a fellow from a dirt-road cottage down on a farm. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' choice for vice president is a quiet man, impeccably tailored and his shoes always shined. He has been married for 44 years to <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> `` B.A.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, once a high-fashion model whose face appeared in <LOCATION> Vogue </LOCATION>, Glamour and <PERSON> Mademoiselle </PERSON> magazines. An attorney and World War II pilot who flew bombers over the Third Reich, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is described as shrewd and competitive, fighting effectively to protect the favorable tax status of the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> oil industry and against the trade deficit. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, introducing <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> Tuesday, said the Texan had `` hit a grand slam home run'' in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> this session _ his committee producing `` a thoughtful, responsible trade bill,'' a welfare revision bill and a bill requiring firms to give workers 60 days notice before closing a plants. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> appeals with equal ease to the men of power in corporate boardrooms and the farm workers of his native <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. He speaks Spanish as fluently as English. He is a conservative, a <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> insider. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, 67, describes himself as one `` who has always been able to build a consensus'' and as proof points to legislation coming out of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> with votes of 18-2 and 19-1. `` I think the first impression of Sen. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is he understands how you handle the halls of power, the board rooms as well as the cloakrooms of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>. `` He knows how to get things done. The good thing also is that he has the compassion for the disadvantaged.'' His father, <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Millard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> native, a motorcycle racer and one-time hard-drinker, arrived in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> with $ 5 in his pockets and built a financial dynasty in the citrus-bearing lands of far <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was elected to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1948 at age 27. Early in his <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> career, he cast a vote that was seen as an act of courage: He was only one of two <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> representatives who voted to repeal the poll tax. In the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, he once suggested that then-President <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> threaten <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> with nuclear bombs unless they withdraw their forces north of the 38th parallel. After six years in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, in the late 1940s and 1950s, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and to make a fortune in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. With his father's help, he founded <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION>, an insurance holding company which controlled stock worth hundreds of millions of dollars. In 1970, he decided to run for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. He successfully challenged the Democratic incumbent, Sen. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Yarborough </PERSON>, who was something of a populist and represented the liberal wing of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Yarborough </PERSON> of supporting the violence which occurred during anti-Vietnam War demonstrations at the 1968 Democratic presidential convention. To make his point, he ran commercials replaying the street warfare of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. In the general election, he defeated <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, then a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> congressman, now the certain Republican presidential nominee. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> says one of his greatest strengths has been an `` across the board spectrum of support'' with Mexican-Americans as the base. But in his race against <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> lost most of the minority voters in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, winning big in rural areas and among blue-collar Democrats. `` He is certainly the mind behind a tremendously effective political machine in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> _ not a party operation but a <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> operation. He is the man that pulls the people together and makes it run,'' said a Capitol Hill Republican Tuesday, speaking on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is a tremendous fund-raiser, outdistancing all other candidates for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> so far this year, according to <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> reports. The <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> had raised over $ 5 million in the 15 months between Jan. 1, 1987, and the end of March 1988. He also took in more political action committee money than any other candidate, over $ 1.46 million. He admitted he had made a `` doozy'' of a mistake early last year when he invited <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lobbyists to pay $ 10,000 for the privilege of joining him for breakfast once a month. After deciding such contributions `` would reflect on my integrity'' _ and reflecting in the glow of intense publicity _ <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> disbanded his `` Chairman's Council'' after only one session and returned the money to an estimated 40 lobbyists who had looked with pleasure at the prospect of breakfasting with the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee that handles taxes. Yet <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> has a long-standing policy of not accepting honoraria for speaking engagements and will rarely accept a gift. During his years in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> gradually moderated his views, often voting for a broader federal role on social issues and gradually opposing the Vietnam War. `` We have fulfilled our commitment,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said in 1971, three years before last <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> combat troops left. On government's role, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> says: `` I think it's terribly important that we invest in children and young people and do the utmost we can to make sure they are born with sound minds and bodies and given a good start in life. `` We have two handicapped grandchildren of our own,'' he says, `` and that's part of the motivation ... You relate to those kinds of concerns and problems. That's why I pushed so hard for prenatal and neonatal health care.'' He was also behind trade legislation for years, even when few others cared about the issue. `` Well, you ca n't be a nation that is spending 104 percent of what you produce and that's what we've been doing and you have to turn that around, increase production of our country; that in turn raises the standing of living for your country,'' he says. `` That's why I pushed hard.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Fenech </PERSON> <PERSON> Adami </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> offered on Tuesday to lead his Mediterranean island nation back into the mainstream of West European traditions, but not as `` a tool of war.'' He also appealed for foreign investment, saying it was essential for the survival of the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> nation. `` We do not feel investment is a dirty word,'' <PERSON> Fenech </PERSON> <PERSON> Adami </PERSON> said in a speech at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a private research group. He said investors would get `` a privileged welcome,'' but did not specify the steps <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> was prepared to take to attract foreign capital. <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> emerged from British rule in 1964 and sought to retain its military ties with the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. It had been a British base during World War II. But <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> declined to give <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> `` observer'' status in the Western alliance.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> anointed Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> as his vice presidential running mate on Tuesday, signaling a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> drive to reclaim a portion of the South in the fall election against <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> described the decision as his `` first presidential act.'' `` We're going to fight for every state in the Union and we're going all out to win,'' the 67-year-old <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said in his public debut as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' political partner Both men said they were following the path to victory forged by another Massachusetts-Texas team, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, in 1960. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, passed over for the job he openly sought, said he was `` too controlled ... and too mature to be angry.'' He said his name would be placed in nomination for president against <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> next Wednesday, but added, `` I no doubt will support the ticket that the convention elects next week.'' There was no immediate reaction from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, although he said in a <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> interview published earlier in the day that <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> `` does n't worry me'' despite the Democrat's victory in a 1970 head-to-head <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> race. Senate GOP leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` could n't have picked a better man.'' In <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, party officials said construction work would be finished on the Omni convention hall ahead of schedule, and a few days before thousands of delegates begin streaming into the convention city over the weekend. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> presented <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> in ceremony televised live from swletering <ORGANIZATION> Faneuil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. A large crowd of supporters stood outside in the afternoon sunshine, waiting for a glimpse of the Democratic ticket for 1988. `` We go to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and we begin the road to victory,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. His choice of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> must be ratified by the delegates to the convention that begins on Monday, and there is no doubt he will have his way, regardless of whether <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> or his delegates decide to seek a symbolic showdown. One <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporter in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, said the selection `` disappointed and shocked'' him. `` It may be that we're back in the Mondale-Carter syndrome of trying to make the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> only slightly less conservative than the Republican party,'' he said. But the two ticket mates said they were on the road to the White House. Said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>: `` The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> axis was good for the country and good for the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in 1960 and it's gon na be a real winner in 1988.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said `` selecting a running mate is probably the first presidential act, if I could use those words, that I will do.'' In choosing <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, he hoped the party's liberal wing would go along. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, 67, is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and a consummate party insider. He is a moderate who differs with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on some issues, most prominently perhaps in his support for aid to the Nicaraguan Contras. Despite <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s professed lack of concern, Republican strategists said that in turning to <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had transformed one of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s strongest states into an autumn battleground. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> has 29 electoral votes, more than any state except <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and no Democrat has been elected president this century without carrying it. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign manager, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, said he was unconcerned. He said Democrats have `` thrown away the vice presidential selection'' because they can not wrest <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> away from the Republicans. `` People in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> want a president, not a vice president. And <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is the man they want,'' he said. Among those considered and then passed over for the vice presidential slot were <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, Sens. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and Reps. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> told <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> they did not want to be considered. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is a prodigious fundraiser and owner of a moderate to conservative voting record after nearly a quarter century in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The selection was reminiscent of the 1960 campaign, when another son of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> _ turned to <PERSON> Texan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> in a drive for votes in the South. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> helped the ticket win <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and other states that year, and Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> provided an echo of that past campaign after hearing of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s selection. `` The Massachusetts-Texas combination got this country moving again in 1960 _ and it will do the same for the nation in 1988,'' said the senator in a statement. Much of the Democratic establishment moved to embrace <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. `` Democratic prospects in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> will be boosted immediately, and when the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people get to know <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> it will strengthen the ticket everywhere,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, a liberal and former primary rival of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, a former Democratic national chairman who has been advising <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, said he was `` excited'' about the choice of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and said it would `` make <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> a hell of a battlefield.'' Asked if he would convince <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> about the merits of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <PERSON> White </PERSON> replied, `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON>'s a very quick study. I'm not worried about that.'' At his news conference, an obviously subdued <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he first learned of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s selection from a reporter, but <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> called him a short while later and told him on the telephone. He said he would press his case for the nomination as well as for changes in the barebones platform drafted by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' forces. There was no hint of whether <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> or his 1,100 delegates would challenge the nomination at the Democratic National Convention next week. Rep. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, R-Ill., who is national co-chairwoman of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presidential campaign, tried to dampen the historical connection `` I'm sure we're going to hear 1960 ad nauseum,'' she said. `` There's a slight difference, of course. He -LRB- <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> -RRB- was not selected by his peers to be in leadership -LRB- as <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> majority leader, had been -RRB-; nor is <PERSON> Dukaks </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>.'' Public polls taken recently indicate that <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is little known nationally, but could give <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> an enormous boost in the race for <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. One survey shows <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> routing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> by more than 20 percentage points in the <ORGANIZATION> Lone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> _ with the margin dwindling to four percentage points if <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> were placed on the ticket. The selection of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> followed a six-week search for a partner for the fall campaign that was focused almost exclusively on members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. `` It's kind of fun, this business of running for the presidency,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as he arrived at his statehouse office a few hours before the mid-afternoon announcement. For the methodical and serious <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, that sounded like a whoop of joy that his long search was over _ and that his secret had held. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaigned during the day at an <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> convention in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, where he promised to have a `` positive civil rights agenda'' if he succeeds President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in office. `` I guarantee you I will be personally involved in protecting the civil rights of all Americans,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said to loud applause from one of the nation's most prominent civil rights groups.

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> tapped Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> as his running mate Tuesday, setting up a home-state challenge to <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s fellow Texan <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and stirring memories of the <LOCATION> Massachusetts-Texas </LOCATION> connection that won the White House in 1960. `` The parallels between 1960 and 1988 are very close indeed,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told a cheering crowd of supporters packed into the steamy hall. `` Then we had had eight rather amiable but sleepy years of Republicans in the White House. We had a country that was ready for change. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> noted that the Republicans nominated an incumbent vice president, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, in 1960, while the Democrats chose Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> in turn tapped Sen. <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> beat that incumbent vice president in 1960, and <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> are going to beat them in 1988,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, cheered by the partisan crowd as he stepped to the microphone, echoed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, saying, `` The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> axis was good for the country and good for the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in 1960 and it's going to be a real winner in November of 1988.'' Both men were accompanied by their wives, <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> appeared for the first time in public without her neck brace since her spinal surgery in early June, and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> smiled at her and said, `` Does n't my bride look fantastic without that collar on.'' The four joined arms and posed for pictures on the stage in historic <LOCATION> Faneuil </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION>, a structure that was built in 1742 and earned the nickname `` The Cradle of Liberty'' as a forum for revolutionaries in colonial <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> brought to the Democratic ticket `` years of experience and a deep commitment to civil rights ... that goes way back to the 1940s.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, stood for good jobs at good wages _ a central theme of his campaign. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said, `` The fact that he's chosen a senator from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, a senator from the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, shows that we're going to fight for every state in the Union and we're going all out to win.'' He said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, a son of <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> immigrants, was `` living out his parents' dream but wants that dream a reality for all Americans. From Faneuil Hall, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> took <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> to the Statehouse, where they spoke briefly to both chambers of the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Legislature. They then went to a gathering, in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, of state Democratic chairmen from across the country. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, in selecting <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, served notice he would not concede <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and its 29 electoral votes to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who calls the state his home. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also added <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> experience and philosophical and geographical balance to the Democratic ticket. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor made the choice late Monday at a meeting with <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON>, his longtime confidant, and campaign manager <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON>. He called <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> Tuesday morning and, after the senator agreed to join the ticket, went to his Statehouse office to telephone the six other men who were being considered for the vice presidential nomination, said sources who spoke to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on the condition they not be identified by name. Still, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, whose actions could be critical to Democratic hopes for a harmonious convention, told reporters he knew nothing of the choice until they told him it was being reported _ several hours before <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> announced it in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. He said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> later phoned him but they did not have a lengthy discussion. Asked if he was angry about being passed over, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> replied: `` No, I'm too controlled, I'm too clear, I'm too mature to be angry.'' He called the selection of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> `` a strategic move.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> already has done what <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> hopes to do in the fall _ defeat <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s win came in a 1970 run for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat he now holds. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> recently said that <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> `` does n't worry me'' and predicted he would carry <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> in November even if <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' running mate. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, an elegantly tailored, silver-haired patrician, is the scion of a wealthy landed family from the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and a leading member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democratic establishment. The senator, like <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, has been a politician most of his adult life, winning election to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in 1948 at the age of 27. But he is no <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> clone, having supported aid for <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Contra rebels, which <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has decried as a `` failed and illegal policy.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is up for re-election to his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat in November, and if he chooses, could run for both offices at once _ a precedent set by <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> in 1960. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> has been a central figure in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' battle with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> over trade legislation _ an issue Democrats plan to play heavily in this fall's campaign. His committee also oversees tax legislation and the welfare reform bill currently before a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conference committee. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> mounted a 1976 run for the Democratic presidential nomination but excited little interest. In 1984, he was on <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>'s list of possible running mates. He created a brief furor in February 1987 when it was revealed that he had asked lobbyists to pay $ 10,000 apiece to join him for breakfast once a month. The breakfast club, called the `` Chairman's Council,'' held one meeting and was quickly disbanded <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> returned the money collected from an estimated 40 lobbyists.

 Fire gutted half a small apartment building early Tuesday, killing seven people, including three children, officials said. The Fire Department was treating the blaze, the city's deadliest this year, as arson although authorities had not determined the cause, spokesman <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> LaGreca </PERSON> said. Firefighters confronted a wall of flames at the building, which was home to about 30 people, officials said. `` It was just pure orange _ a full flame,'' firefighter <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaja </PERSON> said. `` The people had no chance of getting out.'' `` You could see the blaze for five or six blocks,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, 23, a motorists who stopped to help evacuate residents. <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said he kicked in two doors and carried a man from the rear, second-floor apartment, but was unable to rescue the others. `` I heard children hollering on the third floor,'' he said. `` I went to go up, but the blaze started getting really heavy, and I started choking so I ran out.'' Most of the residents were sleeping when the fire broke out at about 12:30 a.m., fire officials said. The blaze was out by 2 a.m., they said. The victims were found on the floor and couches of the second-and third-floor rear units of the three-story building, firefighter <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> said. Three children, ages 10, 12 and 13, were among the victims, said fire department spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheppard </PERSON>. `` Everybody was just trying to get everybody else out, but the fire spread too quick,'' said <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>, 23, who lived in the rear apartment on the first floor. <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>' aunt and cousin died in the fire, he said. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallory </PERSON>, 16, said his grandparents and three of their grandchildren died in the third-floor apartment. <PERSON> Mallory </PERSON> was n't in the building at the time. Firefighters found an empty gasoline can behind the house, but police investigators do n't know if it was used to set the blaze, police Sgt. <PERSON> Darryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said.

 An Amish man jailed for refusing to display an orange slow-moving-vehicle sign on his horse-drawn buggy was exempted from wearing the orange jump suit normally worn by inmates. <PERSON> Gideon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hershberger </PERSON>, 62, served seven days in the Fillmore County Jail for contempt of court and was released Tuesday. <PERSON> Hershberger </PERSON> and other Amish contend that displaying the orange signs is against their religion. `` I'd say it's the most I can do,'' he said. `` I do n't want to be stubborn, but I will continue without the sign. What else can I do?'' County Sheriff <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Gudmundson </PERSON> allowed <PERSON> Hershberger </PERSON> to wear his blue denim pants, deep blue cotton shirt and navy blue suspenders. District Court Judge <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> ruled earlier this month that public safety overrides the Amish resistance to the orange triangle. `` Religion is not a defense in this case,'' she said. <PERSON> Hershberger </PERSON> said the Amish prefer to trust God over worldly symbols, and they want to live the way their forefathers lived. Some Amish use orange triangles. But others use a black triangle with a white outline and some of the older, more conservative members like <PERSON> Hershberger </PERSON> use no sign at all. They prefer to outline their buggies with white reflective tape. <PERSON> Hershberger </PERSON> spent his jail time working in a woodworking shop and reading. <PERSON> Gudmundson </PERSON> is sympathetic to <PERSON> Hershberger </PERSON> and other Amish violators. `` They say they do n't want to create problems for me or the state, which they are,'' he said. `` But this is something I admire them for, even though I ca n't agree with it.''

 <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign manager, said Tuesday that <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> have `` thrown away the vice presidential selection'' with <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' choice of Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> as his running mate. `` After all is said and done, they're not going to win <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said in an interview. `` People in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> want a president, not a vice president. And <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is the man they want.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, en route to baseball's All-Star game in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, told reporters, `` That's interesting. That's what I think about it,'' when asked about the <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> selection. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said he was delighted with the choice of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, saying `` If I were selecting the nominee, I could n't have done better myself.'' He claimed that nearly any of the other prominent Democrats mentioned as a possible vice president, including Sens. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> as well as <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, would have posed a greater challenge to the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> ticket this fall. `` The Democrats have thrown away the vice presidential selection as far as I'm concerned ... He will help some in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, but only enough to get them -LRB- Democrats -RRB- to spend a whole bunch of time and money down there that they're going to end up squandering away.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign manager said that the selection of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> may give Democrats a surge in the polls in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, `` but that will settle down and after all is said and done, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is going to win <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.'' He dismissed comparisons to the 1960 Democratic ticket that also had a Massachusetts-Texas breakdown with President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. `` If it was like 1960, then we'll win handily, because the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> in 1960 was solidly for <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>. Now the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> is going to be solidly for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said. `` Democrats will be saying that ad nauseam,'' Rep. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, R-Ill., national co-chairwoman of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign, said in reference to the comparison of the two tickets `` But it's a little different running for president and vice president than running for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. We're talking about different sets of experiences. His -LRB- <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s -RRB- experience has been in finance. You do n't think of him as being strong either in terms of social issues or in terms of foreign policy, frankly,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> sid. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> defeated <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in a 1970 Senate race, but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides insisted that fact would not trouble the certain 1988 GOP presidential nominee. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> himself did not mention the selection of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> in a morning speech to a convention of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Colored People. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had said he wanted to wait to see whom the Democrats would pick for the No. 2 spot on their ticket before giving thought to a running mate. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> still intends to delay his own choice of a running mate until the Republican National Convention in August. But, Mrs. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said, the selection of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> does not make much difference in terms of the dynamics for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> ticket. `` The one thing it does is it allows <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the same freedom he had yesterday. I do n't think the selection of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, without diminishing the senator at all, is one that says now <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has to do x, y or z,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was not that well known outside <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, other than being identified as `` kind of big oil ... and breakfasts, breakfasts at <ORGANIZATION> Tiffany </ORGANIZATION>'s sort-of-thing,'' a reference to <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s short-lived effort to organize breakfasts with lobbyists who were to pay $ 10,000 each. `` I still think <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will carry <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. `` You never underestimate an opponent. On the other hand, I suspect no one's in raging fear either.''

 <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> appeared Tuesday with his latest recruit, a 701-pound man from <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> who is determined to become `` a normal person again.'' `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is the most obese nation in the world,'' <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` It is well established as the No. 1 nutrition-related problem in our nation.'' <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON>, during a brief stopover at <LOCATION> Lambert </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, described the regimen he will prescribe for <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Nellis </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Hurst </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, for the next two years. It will include a diet of raw fruits and vegetables. From <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, the two men flew to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Nellis </PERSON> will undergo a medical evaluation. Then he will fly to another location, possibly in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, for the major portion of his weight-loss program, which could last up to two years. <PERSON> Nellis </PERSON>, a former school bus driver, said his weight, although well above normal since early childhood, was only 300 pounds when he married his wife 10 years ago. `` I want to be able to go to work,'' <PERSON> Nellis </PERSON> said of his goal to lose 500 pounds. `` I want to be able to be a better husband to my wife and just to be a normal person.'' More than a dozen people whose weight reductions have been supervised by <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> in recent years include <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Hempstead </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, man whose case received wide attention last fall. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> came to <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>'s aid when <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, who weighed 1,200 pounds, became wedged in the door of his home. <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> showed steady improvement under the routine that <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> supervised but was forced to drop out because of his fear of leaving his home to go to a center. `` Ten to 13 percent of our children are overweight, and we lose more people to obesity-related problems than we do to drugs,'' he said. `` We need a national goal of weight management for life.''

 Legislators of a mountain enclave that has been involved in an ethnic tug-of-war for months voted Tuesday to secede from <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> and join <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> _ a dramatic first in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> politics, but probably futile. The legislature of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, a predominantly Armenian enclave in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, was unanimous except for one abstention in the decision to secede and rename the area the <ORGANIZATION> Artsakh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Autonomous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Region </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armenia </ORGANIZATION>, radio reporters in the territory reported. About 160,000 people live in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> and three-quarters are ethnic Armenians. Dissident historian <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> said the legislative action appears to have little chance of success. `` It's unconstitutional,'' he said. `` It can not be considered legal.'' Never before in Soviet history has a region's legislature voted to withdraw from the republic of which it is a part, he said. The decision defies central authorities all the way up to <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and tests Kremlin tolerance of assertions of rights by the country's more than 100 national groups. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has encouraged citizens to speak out under his policy of glasnost, or openness. The Soviet constitution gives citizens the right to self-determination, but also requires that a republic consent to any change in its boundaries. <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> is an autonomous region of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, which is Soviet <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s neighbor in the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION>. Its legislature asked Feb. 20 that the Azerbaijani and Armenian governments approve the transfer to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. The Armenians agreed June 15 but <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>'s legislature rejected the request two days later. Strikes and street rallies have disrupted <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>, the territorial capital, for weeks. A statement by the legislature, read over the telephone by reporters for the <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION> radio station, said: `` The Soviet of People's Deputies of the <ORGANIZATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Autonomous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Region </ORGANIZATION> declares its secession from the <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Socialist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>.'' Armenians, most of whom are Christians, consider <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> part of their ancestral homeland but in 1923 the region was assigned to <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, which is predominantly Moslem. The dispute began with demonstrations by Armenians in both <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> itself in February and ethnic riots were reported in <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION>, an <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> port. Officials said 32 people were killed _ 26 Armenians and six <LOCATION> Azerbaijanis </LOCATION> _ and 200 injured. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told a national <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conference June 28 the powers of the country's 15 republics and other ethnic entities should be expanded, but said some ethnic minorities were going too far. `` Some think that any questions, from the redrawing of borders to the establishment of opposition parties, can be resolved'' through glasnost, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> believes such abuses of democratization run counter to the task of perestroika, contradict the people's interests,'' he said Perestroika, or restructuring, is what <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> calls his plans for social and economic reform. <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> rejected the territorial demand in February, but said living conditions in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> would be improved. The Kremlin approved a multimillion-dollar package of social and cultural improvements for the region in March, but strikes and demonstrations continued. After <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> rejected the transfer request, <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>'s legislature proposed a compromise: putting the region under temporary control of the central government in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Armenian delegates to the party conference in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> suggested other compromises that included attaching the region to <LOCATION> Stavropol </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s home district in the Russian republic. <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>'s leaders did not budge. <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> said in a telephone interview that Tuesday's decision appeared aimed at pressuring <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> into approving the territorial transfer. Pravda, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, said on Tuesday an `` overwhelming majority'' of Armenians who began a strike July 4 in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, the Armenian capital, had decided to return to work. Dissident journalist <PERSON> Mofses </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorgisyan </PERSON> said the walkout was gaining strength, however, and that representatives of factories in the republic of 3.4 million people reported 70 percent absenteeism Monday. He said by telephone from <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> that soldiers and tanks were deployed around the city's outskirts and militiamen patrolled inside the city limits. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armenia </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> criticized officials throughout the republic Tuesday for `` delaying, showing carelessness and irresponsibility in the realization of practical measures aimed at improving the situation,'' the government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Gorgisyan </PERSON> said 300,000 to 400,000 people gathered outside <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ancient </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manuscripts </ORGANIZATION>, known as the Matenadaran, on Monday night to support the strike and press the territorial demand. A reporter for the republic's official news agency, Armenpress, said the number was about 100,000. <PERSON> Gorgisyan </PERSON>, 27, belongs to an underground group called the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Self-Determination </ORGANIZATION> and publishes an underground journal called Fatherland.

<HEAD>Boy May Face Kidney Dysfunction as Result of Brownsville Accident</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GALVESTON, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A boy trapped for 20 hours under the rubble of a collapsed department store may lose use of his kidneys, doctors said. <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Branch </ORGANIZATION> physicians treating 9-year-old <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Merida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, said toxins from dead muscle tissue apparently destroyed his body's ability to cleanse his blood. However, doctors said <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON>'s spunk may help him through the critical first days of what may be a months-long stay at the hospital. `` He's mad, and he's scared,'' said <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Calhoun </PERSON>, an orthopedic surgeon. <ORGANIZATION> Mena </ORGANIZATION> and a cousin who lost a leg in the accident in <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> last week are receiving high-pressure oxygen treatments. Both are in critical condition, officials said. `` He complains the whole time he is in the -LRB- hyperbaric -RRB- chamber,'' said Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mader </PERSON>, who is overseeing <ORGANIZATION> Mena </ORGANIZATION>'s treatment at <ORGANIZATION> UTMB </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Biomedical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. `` But that's good,'' <PERSON> Mader </PERSON> said, `` because he's a fighter, and that is what it takes.'' <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON>'s mother remained hospitalized in <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION> and a 15-year-old sister, <PERSON> Mya </PERSON>, died in the accident, authorities said. The boy's father, who like his son speaks no English, lies outside the chamber window so he can look at the boy. `` They communicate over the telephone,'' <PERSON> Mader </PERSON> said. `` The father gives the boy a lot of support. Otherwise, he'd be unmanageable.'' <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON>'s cousin, <PERSON> Yvette </PERSON> <PERSON> Lire </PERSON>, 14, of <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, has shown some improvement since her right leg was amputated below the knee, <PERSON> Calhoun </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Yvette </PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON> Paloma </PERSON>, 12, died in the accident. The <ORGANIZATION> Amigo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Store </ORGANIZATION> collapsed during heavy rain Friday, killing 14 people and injuring at least 47 others.

<HEAD>Bill Would Ban U.S. Exports of Waste</HEAD>

<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON> and three other congressmen on Tuesday introduced a bill that would ban the export of most American waste. The legislation would cover any hazardous waste, waste oil, incinerator ash and other forms of solid waste, with some exceptions for material that would be recycled in the country receiving it. Violators would be subject to as much as two years in prison and fines of $ 50,000, with both to be doubled on a second offense. <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>, a Democrat, said at a news conference that the legislation would apply to both rich and poor countries. He emphasized the effect of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> waste exports in the Third World, calling them `` an act of toxic terrorism.'' He said poor countries could be tempted by the offer of large sums by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies. According to <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Vallette </PERSON>, a researcher for <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION>, eight industrial countries have received <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> waste since 1986: <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Vallette </PERSON> added that some of the waste shipped to Third World countries has gone through <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> report said that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has become a major recipient of waste from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and recently from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, largely because fees for its waste disposal are much lower than in continental <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> report said at least 11 Third World countries have received waste from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in that period: <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Leone </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>, a Democrat, was joined by two other Democrats _ Reps. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> _ and Republican Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, in sponsoring the bill. It would exempt <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> from the export ban because they have agreements with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government on waste disposal.

<BYLINE>By EVANS WITT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' choice of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> as his vice presidential nominee balances the geographical and ideological scales of the Democratic ticket _ and provides a staunch challenge to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in a state the vice president calls his home. `` They are trying to break <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s back in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>,'' said Republican pollster <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarrance </PERSON>. Indeed, it's almost as if <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> is suddenly the only state that counts for the Democrats. The convention chairman is from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>: House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. The keynote speaker is from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>: state Treasurer <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>. And now the vice presidential choice. `` They have n't just taken a bow toward <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>: they genuflected,'' said Democratic consultant <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Mellman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has `` made a very big investment in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>,'' he added. `` We better win it now.'' A key question is whether <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> does anything for the Democratic ticket outside <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. One argument is that he will reassure the white Southern males who have deserted the party by the millions in recent elections, persuading them the Democrats are not too liberal and concerned with minorities and special interests. But the flip side is that <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is little known outside his home state _ except in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. Except for those three states, he might not make any difference. But then, vice presidential candidates rarely make much of a difference, since the focus is on the presidential candidates. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> holds 29 electoral votes, more than 10 percent of the 278 needed to win the White House in November. The state ranks third, behind only <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. That is clearly the central reason for choosing <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> over the other names on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' short list. Historians are fond of saying Democrats have not won the presidency in this century without winning <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. What is less often said is that winning <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> does not guarantee a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> victory. <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> won the Lone <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> in 1968, for example, and still lost to <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> calls <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> his home, still voting there even though the only home he actually owns these days is on the coastline of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. `` It makes <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> a battleground, where before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> sewn up,'' said Republican strategist <PERSON> Vince </PERSON> <PERSON> Breglio </PERSON>. It's a direct shot at the Republicans' natural base for the presidential contest. The more time and money the Democrats can force the Republicans to spend winning states in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> _ where the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> national ticket has been strong in recent years _ the less time and money <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his running mate will be able to spend in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Now <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> must face his choice of a running mate. He could choose to counter the Democratic thrust in the South by picking someone from the region for the No. 2 spot _ like former <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>. Or he can make a move into the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> _ which should be <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' strong area _ with a choice such as Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> can also go to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and try to nail down that state's 47 electoral votes with Gov <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> as a running mate. Or he can mend fences in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> GOP leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' choice of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> broadens the Democratic appeal in crucial ways for the fall campaign. The liberal <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor will be running with the conservative <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> insider from the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>. The specialist in economic growth is paired with the legislative expert with a reputation in international economics. The opponent of aid to the Contras chose a supporter of such funding. `` It cuts down the angle at which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> can shoot,'' said Democratic pollster <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>. `` They ca n't say the ticket is inexperienced or too liberal.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> will certainly help the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> reach out to conservative businessmen who have rarely backed the party's hopefuls <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> has been masterful at gathering campaign contributions from normally <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> sources, a fact that has Republicans awed and a bit peeved. __ EDITORS' NOTE _ <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> <PERSON> Witt </PERSON> is a Washington-based political writer who is covering the 1988 presidential campaign.

<HEAD>The Restoration of Competence and the Revival of Hope</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 We the people of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, in order to initiate the changes necessary to keep <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> strong and make <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> better, in order to restore competence, caring and incorruptibility to the federal Executive Branch and get it working again fairly for all Americans, and in order to secure for our children a future of liberty and opportunity, hereby pledge our party, our leaders, our elected officials and our every individual effort to fulfilling the following fundamental principles for all members of the American family. We believe that all Americans have a fundamental right to economic justice in a stronger, surer national economy, an economy that must grow steadily without inflation, that can generate a rising standard of living for all and fulfill the desire of all to work in dignity up to their full potential in good health with good jobs at good wages, an economy that is prosperous in every region, from coast to coast, including our rural towns and our older industrial communities, our mining towns, our energy producing areas and the urban areas that have been neglected for the past seven years. We believe that, as a first-rate world power moving into the 21st century, we can have a first-rate full employment economy, with an indexed minimum wage that can help lift and keep families out of poverty, with training and employment programs _ including child care and health care _ that can help people move from welfare to work, with portable pensions and an adequate Social Security System, safeguarded against emasculation and privatization, that can help assure a comfortable and fulfilling old age, with opportunities for voluntary national public service, above and beyond current services, that can enrich our communities, and with all workers assured the protection of an effective law that guarantees their rights to organize, join the union of their choice, and bargain collectively with their employer, free from anti-union tactics. We believe that the time has come for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to take charge once again of its economic future, to reverse seven years of `` voodoo economics,'' `` trickle down'' policies, fiscal irresponsibility, and economic violence against poor and working people that have converted this proud country into the world's largest debtor nation, mortgaged our children's future by tripling our national debt, placed home ownership out of reach for most young families, permitted the rise of poverty and homelessness on the streets of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, reduced the buying power of working men and women, and witnessed the decline of our industrial, natural resource and mining base, the unending tragedy of family farm foreclosures, an unhealthy dependence on foreign energy and foreign capital, and the increasing foreign ownership of our land and natural resources We believe that it is time for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, within a strong commitment to fiscal responsibility, to reassert progressive values and reinvest in its people, to invest in new priorities, in life-long education and training, in targeted economic development, in a healthy small business community and in retooled <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> industry; that it is time for the broad revitalization of home town <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, involving financial institutions in the provision of crucial credit by encouraging special commitments in exchange for bailing out those that are failing, reforming and expanding community reinvestment laws, and reversing the trend of financial concentration and deregulation, all combining to reverse the insecurity that has increasingly troubled our workers and their families in this rapidly changing society that has left some communities and regions behind. There is no good reason why the nation we love, the greatest and richest nation on earth, should rank first among the industrialized nations in output per person but nearly last in infant mortality, first in the percentage of total expenditures devoted to defense but nearly last in the percentage devoted to education and housing. We believe that government should set the standard in recognizing that worker productivity is enhanced by the principle of pay equity for working women and no substandard wage competition for public contracts; by family leave policies that no longer force employees to choose between their jobs and their children or ailing parents; by safe and healthy work places, now jeopardized by seven callous years of lowered and unenforced occupational safety standards for American workers; and by major increases in assistance making child care more available and affordable to low-and middle-income families, helping states build a strong child care infrastructure, setting minimum standards for health, safety, and quality, and thereby enabling parents to work and their children to get an early start on their education and personal fulfillment. We believe that the strength of our families is enhanced by programs to prevent abuse and malnutrition among children, crime, dropouts and pregnancy among teenagers and violence in the family; by aggressive child support enforcement; and by emphasizing family preservation and quality foster care. We believe that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> needs more trade, fair trade, an administration willing to use all the tools available to better manage our trade in order to export more American goods and fewer American jobs, an administration willing to recognize in the formulation and enforcement of our trade laws that workers' rights are important human rights abroad as well as at home, and that advance notice of plant closings and major layoffs is not only fundamentally right but also economically sound. We believe that we can and must improve our competitiveness in the world economy, using our best minds to create the most advanced technology in the world through a greater commitment to civilian research and development and to science, engineering and mathematics training, through more public-private and business-labor cooperation and mutual respect, through more intergovernmental partnerships, and through a better balance between fiscal and monetary policy and between military and civilian research and development. We further believe in halting such irresponsible corporate conduct as unproductive takeovers, monopolistic mergers, insider trading, and golden parachutes for executives by reinvigorating our antitrust and securities laws, reviewing large mergers, and discouraging short-term speculation taking place at the expense of long-term investment.

 We believe that the education of our citizens, from <ORGANIZATION> Head </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Start </ORGANIZATION> to institutions of higher learning, deserves our highest priority, and that history will judge the next administration less by its success in building new weapons of war than by its success in improving young minds. We believe that this nation needs to invest in its children on the front side of life by expanding the availability of pre-school education for children at risk; to invest in its teachers through training and enrichment programs, including a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teacher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> to recruit teachers for tomorrow, especially minorities, with scholarships today; to commit itself for the first time to the principle that no one should be denied the opportunity to attend college for financial reasons; to ensure equal access to education by providing incentives and mechanisms for the equalization of financing among local school districts within each state; to reverse cuts made in compensatory reading, math and enrichment services to low income children; and to expand support for bilingual education, historically <PERSON> Black </PERSON> and Hispanic institutions, the education of those with special needs, the arts and humanities, and an aggressive campaign to end illiteracy. We believe that illegal drugs pose a direct threat to the security of our nation from coast to coast, invading our neighborhoods, classrooms, homes and communities large and small; that every arm and agency of government at every federal, state and local level _ including every useful diplomatic, military, educational, medical and law enforcement effort necessary _ should at long last be mobilized and coordinated with private efforts under the direction of a national drug `` czar'' to halt both the international supply and the domestic demand for illegal drugs now ravaging our country; and that the legalization of illicit drugs would represent a tragic surrender in a war we intend to win. We believe that this effort should include comprehensive programs to educate our children at the earliest ages on the dangers of alcohol and drug abuse, readily available treatment and counseling for those who seek to address their dependency, the strengthening of vital interdiction agencies such as the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION>, a summit of Western hemispheric nations to coordinate efforts to cut off drugs at the source, and foreign development assistance to reform drug-based economics by promoting crop substitution. We believe that the federal government should provide increased assistance to local criminal justice agencies, enforce a ban on `` cop killer'' bullets that have no purpose other than the killing and maiming of law enforcement officers, reinforce our commitment to help crime victims, and assume a leadership role in securing the safety of our neighborhoods and homes. We further believe that the repeated toleration in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> of unethical and unlawful greed among too many of those who have been governing our nation, procuring our weapons and polluting our environment has made far more difficult the daily work of the local policemen, teachers and parents who must convey to our children respect for justice and authority. We believe that we honor our multicultural heritage by assuring equal access to government services, employment, housing, business enterprise and education to every citizen regardless of race, sex, national origin, religion, age, handicapping condition or sexual orientation; that these rights are without exception too precious to be jeopardized by federal judges and <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials chosen during the past seven years _ by a political party increasingly monolithic both racially and culturally _ more for their unenlightened ideological views than for their respect for the rule of law. We further believe that we must work for the adoption of the Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution; that the fundamental right of reproductive choice should be guaranteed regardless of ability to pay; that our machinery for civil rights enforcement and legal services to the poor should be rebuilt and vigorously utilized; and that our immigration policy should be reformed to promote fairness, non-discrimination and family reunification and to reflect our constitutional freedoms of speech, association and travel. We further believe that the voting rights of all minorities should be protected, the recent surge in hate violence and negative stereotyping combated, the discriminatory English-only pressure groups resisted, our treaty commitments with native Americans enforced by culturally sensitive officials, and the lingering effects of past discrimination eliminated by affirmative action, including goals, timetables, and procurement set-asides. We believe that the housing crisis of the 1980s must be halted _ a crisis that has left this country battered by a rising tide of homelessness unprecedented since the Great Depression, by a tightening squeeze on low - and moderate-income families that is projected to leave 7 million people without affordable housing by 1993, and by a bleak outlook for young working families who can not afford to buy their first home We believe that steps should be taken to ensure a decent place to live for every American. We believe that homelessness _ a national shame _ should be ended in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>; that the supply of affordable housing should be expended in order to avoid the projected shortfall; that employer-assisted housing and development by community based non-profit organizations should be encouraged; that the inventory of public and subsidized housing should be renovated, preserved and increased; that foreclosed government property should be restored to productive use; and that first-time homebuyers should be assisted. We believe that we can rebuild <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, creating good jobs at good wages through a national reinvestment strategy to construct new housing, repair our sewers, rebuild our roads and replace our bridges. We believe that we must pursue needed investment through innovative partnerships and creative financing mechanisms such as a voluntary program to invest a portion of public and private pension funds as a steady source of investment capital by guaranteeing security and a fair rate of return and assuring sound project management.

 We believe that all Americans should enjoy access to affordable, comprehensive health services for both the physically and mentally ill, from prenatal care for pregnant women at risk to more adequate care for our <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and other veterans, from well-baby care to childhood immunization to <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>; that federal coordination and leadership are necessary to contain health care costs while assuring quality care and advanced medical research; that quality, affordable, long-term home and health care should be available to all senior and disabled citizens, allowing them to live with dignity in the most appropriate setting; that an important first step toward comprehensive health services is to ensure that every family should have the security of basic health insurance; and that the HIV-AIDS epidemic is an unprecedented public health emergency requiring increased support for accelerated research on, and expedited <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> approval of, treatments and vaccines, comprehensive education and prevention, compassionate patient care, adoption of the public health community consensus on voluntary and confidential testing and counseling, and protection of the civil rights of those suffering from AIDS or AIDS-Related Complex or testing positive for the HIV antibody. We believe that the last seven years have witnessed an unprecedented assault on our national interest and national security through the poisoning of our air with acid rain, the dumping of toxic wastes into our water, and the destruction of our parks and shores; that pollution must be stopped at the source by shifting to new, environmentally sound manufacturing and farming technologies; that the federal government must promote recycling as the best, least costly way to solve the trash crisis, aggressively enforce toxic waste laws and require polluters to be responsible for future cleanup costs; that this nation must redouble its efforts to provide clean waterways, sound water management and safe drinkable ground water throughout the country; that our national parks, forests, wildlife refuges, and coastal zones must be protected and used only in an environmentally sound manner; that all offshore oil drilling in environmentally sensitive areas should be opposed; and that regular world environment summits should be convened by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to address the depletion of the ozone layer, the `` greenhouse effect,'' the destruction of tropical forests and other global threats and to create a global action plan for environmental restoration. We believe that all Americans, producers and consumers alike, benefit when food and fiber are produced not by a few large corporations and conglomerates but by hundreds of thousands of family farmers obtaining a fair price for their product; that the disastrous farm policies of the last seven years, despite record federal spending, have forced hundreds of thousands of families from their farms while others are struggling to survive; and that a workable agricultural policy should include supply management, reasonable price supports, soil conservation and protection of rural water quality, credit and foreclosure relief, the return of federally held foreclosed lands to minority, beginning and restarting farmers, the development of new uses and markets for American farm products, improved disaster relief, and the revitalization of rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> through new sources of capital for rural business and new federal support for rural health care, housing, education, water supply and infrastructure. We further believe that no person should go to bed hungry and that we must renew the fight against hunger at home and abroad, make food available to those nations who need it and want it, and convene an international conference of food producing nations. We believe that a balanced, coherent energy policy, based on dependable supplies at reasonable prices, is necessary to protect our national security, ensure a clean environment, and promote stable economic growth and prosperity, both nationally and in our energy producing regions; that the inevitable transition from our present, nearly total dependence on increasingly scarce and environmentally damaging non-renewable sources to renewable sources should begin now; that such a policy includes increased cooperation with our hemispheric neighbors, filling that <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, promoting the use of natural gas, methanol and ethanol as alternative transportation fuels, encouraging the use of our vast natural gas and coal reserves while aggressively developing clean coal technology to combat acid rain, and providing targeted new incentives for new oil and gas drilling and development, for the development of renewable and alternative sources of energy, and for the promotion of energy conservation. We believe that with these changes the country could reduce its reliance on nuclear power while insisting that all plants are safe, environmentally sound and assured of safe waste disposal. We believe that this country's democratic processes must be revitalized: by securing universal, same day and mail-in voter registration as well as registration on the premises of appropriate government agencies; by preventing the misuse of at-large elections, the abuse of election day challenges and registration roll purges, any undercounting in the national census, and any dilution of the one-person, one-vote principle; by ending discrimination against public employees who are denied the right to full political participation; by supporting statehood for the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>; by treating the offshore territories under our flag as full partners, in spirit, of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> political family, by empowering the commonwealth of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> with greater autonomy within its relationship with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to achieve the economic, social and political goals of its people, and by giving it just and fair participation in federal programs; by assuring and pledging the full and equal access of women and minorities to elective office and party endorsement; and by minimizing the domination and distortion of our election by moneyed interests. We believe in a stronger <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> ready to make the tough choices of leadership in an ever-dangerous world: militarily stronger in our overall defense and anti-terrorist capabilities and in the cohesion of our military alliances; economically stronger at home and in the global marketplace; intellectually stronger in the advances of our schools, science and technology; and spiritually stronger in the principles we exemplify to the world. We believe in a clearheaded, tough-minded, decisive <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> foreign policy that will reflect the changing nature of threats to our security and respond to them in a way that reflects our values and the support of our people, a foreign policy that will respect our Constitution, our <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and our traditional democratic principles and will in turn be respected for its quiet strength, its bipartisan goals, and its steadfast attention to the concerns and contributions of our allies and international organizations. We believe that we must reassume a role of responsible active international leadership based upon our commitment to democracy, human rights and a more secure world; that this nation, as the world power with the broadest global interests and concerns, has a greater stake than any in building a world at peace and governed by law; that we can neither police the world nor retreat from it; and that to have reliable allies we must be a reliable ally.

<HEAD>WASHN: reliable ally.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 We believe that our national strength has been sapped by a defense establishment wasting money on duplicative and dubious new weapons instead of investing more in readiness and mobility; that our national strength will be enhanced by more stable defense budgets and by a commitment from our allies to assume a greater share of the costs and responsibilities reqired to maintain peace and liberty; and that as military spending and priorities change, government should encourage the conversion of affected military facilities and the retraining of workers to facilitate the creation of new forms of communication, space development and new peacetime growth and productivity. We believe in an <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, neither gun-shy nor trigger-happy, that will promote peace and prevent war _ not by trading weapons for hostages, not by sending brave Americans to undefined missions in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, not by relaxing our vigilance on the assumption that long-range Soviet interests have permanently changed, not by toasting a tyrant-like <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> as a disciple of democracy, but by maintaining a stable nuclear deterrent sufficient to counter any <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> threat, by standing up to any <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> adversary whenever necessary and sitting down with him whenever possible, by making clear our readiness to use force when force is required to protect our essential security commitments, by testing the intentions of the new Soviet leaders about arms control, emigration, human rights and other issues, and by matching them not merely in rhetoric but in reciprocal initiatives and innovation, in joint efforts to combat environmental threats, explore peaceful uses of space and eradicate disease and poverty in the development world, and in a mutual effort to transform the arms race that neither side can win into a contest for people's minds, a contest we know our side will win. We believe in following up the INF Treaty, a commendable first step, with mutual, verifiable and enforceable agreements that will make significant reductions in strategic weapons in a way that diminishes the risk of nuclear attack by either superpower; reduce conventional forces to lower and equivalent levels in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, requiring deeper cuts on the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact side; ban chemical and space weapons in their entirety; and halt all nuclear weapons testing while strengthening our efforts to prevent the spread of these weapons to other nations before the nightmare of nuclear terrorism engulfs us all. We believe in an <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that recognizes not only the realities of East-West relations but the challenges and opportunities of the developing world; that will support and strengthen international law and institutions, promote human and political rights and measure them by one yardstick, and work for economic growth and development. We believe that we must provide leadership, compassion and economic assistance to those nations stunted by overwhelming debt, deprivation and austerity, and that we must work to promote active agreements between developing and industrial countries, and the major public and commercial lenders, to provide debt relief and rekindle and sustain economic growth and democracy in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, and the poorest continent, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, which deserves special attention. We further believe that we must enlist the trade surplus nations to join with us in supporting new aid initiatives to fuel growth in developing countries that, though economically depressed, are rich in human and natural potential. We believe this country should work harder to stop the supplies of arms, from both East and West, that fuel conflict in regions such as the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. Deeply disturbed that the current administration has too long abandoned the peace process in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and consistently undermined it in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, we believe that this country, maintaining the special relationship with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> founded upon mutually shared values and strategic interests, should provide new leadership to deliver the promise of peace and security through negotiations that has been held out to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and its neighbors by the Camp David Accords and to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> Arias </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plan </ORGANIZATION>, which calls for an end to the fighting, national reconciliation, guarantees of human rights, democracy, and security, enabling the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other nations to focus on the pressing social and economic needs of the people of that region. We further believe in pursuing a policy of economic cooperation instead of confrontation with <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and our other hemispheric friends; in helping all developing countries build their own peaceful democratic institutions free from foreign troops, subversion and domination and free from domestic dictators and aggressors; in honoring our treaty obligations; and in using all the tools at our disposal, including diplomacy, trade, aid, food, ideas, and ideals, to defend and enlarge the horizons of freedom on this planet. We believe in an <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that will promote human rights, human dignity and human opportunity in every country on earth; that will encourage free speech and association and decry oppression in nations friendly and unfriendly, Communist and non-communist, that will encourage our European friends to respect human rights and resolve their longstanding differences over <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>; that will encourage wherever possible the forces of pluralism and democracy in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and that will support the struggle for human rights in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. We believe the apartheid regime in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to be a uniquely repressive regime, ruthlessly deciding every aspect of public and private life by skin color, engaging in unrelenting violence against its citizens at home and promoting naked aggression against its neighbors in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. We believe that the time has come to end all vestiges of the failed policy of constructive engagement, to declare <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> a terrorist state, to impose comprehensive sanctions upon its economy, to lead the international community in participation in these actions, and to determine a date certain by which <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> corporations must leave <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. We further believe that to achieve regional security in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, we must press forcefully for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s independence by calling for the end of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s illegal occupation, a cease fire and elections, must end our counterproductive policy in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and must offer support and further assistance to <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> and other frontline states. In sum, we believe it is time for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to change and move forward again in the interest of all its families _ to turn away from an era in which too many of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s children have been homeless or hungry and invest in a new era of hope and progress, an era of secure families in a secure <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in a secure world. We believe the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream of opportunity for every citizen can be a reality for all Americans willing to meet their own responsibilities to help make it come true. We believe that governments at the national, state and local level, in partnerships between those levels and in partnerships with the private sector, exist to help us solve our problems instead of adding to them. We believe in competent, pragmatic governments, accountable to the people, led by men and women dedicated not to self interest but to service, motivated not by ideology but by American ideals, governing not in a spirit of power and privilege but with a sense of compassion and community. For many years, in state and local capitals across this nation, Democrats have been successfully solving problems and helping people with exactly this kind of innovative government. Therefore, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in convention assembled and united, the party of hope and change and fairness for all, hereby declares its readiness to end the stalemate in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> by challenging, encouraging and inviting the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people _ challenging them to do their patriotic best to meet their community responsibilities, encouraging them to protect and preserve their families, our most precious assets, and inviting them to join with us in leading the land we love to a brighter and still greater future of opportunity and justice for all.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Platform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> released a 4,700-word proposed platform Tuesday without the minority planks that the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign may still push. <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> <PERSON> Norton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s chief platform negotiator, said, `` Our minority reports are not in there because we're still negotiating.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has said he may press floor fights in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> next Tuesday on a dozen or more issues, including his call for higher taxes on the wealthy, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> freeze, more spending on education and Head Start, no-first-use of nuclear weapons and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> self-determination. He is expected, however, to take only three or four of his key issues to the floor for votes. With 1,135 delegates, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> can force debates on any issue, but <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s majority of 2,426 is large enough to leave no doubt as to who will win the fights. The proposed platform, hammered out June 25 by the party's platform writers in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, commits the Democrats `` to reverse seven years of voodoo economics,'' to `` more stable defense budgets,'' to advance notice of plant layoffs and to guaranteed `` freedom of reproductive choice ... regardless of ability to pay. It avoids any mention of tax increases and does not say how <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and the Democrats would deal with the huge federal deficits. <PERSON> Norton </PERSON>, on her way to a meeting with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, said, `` The negotiations are going well.'' The party, in a memorandum appended to the document, said: `` To avoid delay in printing the platform, all parties have agreed that the report on minority planks, which is still under discussion, will be available at the convention.'' The proposed platform, written with the help of onetime President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> speechwriter <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorensen </PERSON>, is one-tenth the length of the 45,000-word tome the Democrats ran on in 1984. Party chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said the Democrats would be better served by a short, visionary statement stripped of special interest language that discomfited some Democrats and delighted Republicans. The platform, titled `` The Resoration of Competence and the Revival of Hope,'' endorses `` pay equity for working women and no substandard wage competition for public contracts''; `` major increases'' in child care aid for low - and middle-income families; an indexed minimum wage, and a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teacher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> to recruit teachers with scholarships The platform also backs expanded support for bilingual education; appointment of a national drug czar; a ban on `` cop killer'' bullets; passage of the Equal Rights Amendmment; accelerated research on AIDS `` and protection of the civil rights of those suffering from AIDS'' or testing positive for the IV antibody.'' It also condemns <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> as a `` terrorist'' state; endorses same-day and mail-in voter registration, and decries `` any dilution of the one-person, one-vote principle''; supports statehood for the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> and `` greater autonomy for <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>,'' and pledges `` the full and equal access of women and minorities to elective office and party endorsement.'' `` We believe in an <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, neither gun-shy nor trigger-happy, that will promote peace and prevent war _ not by trading weapons for hostages, not by sending brave Americans to undefined missions in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> ... not by toasting a tyrant like <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> as a disciple of democracy, but by maintaining a stable nuclear deterrent sufficient to counter any <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> threat. ... `` the platform says. It calls for reinvigorating the Camp David peace process in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and support for Costa Rican President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>' peace plan in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> It mentions neither <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> nor <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by name.

<HEAD>House OKs Mechanism to Close Unneeded Bases</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, trying to solve one of its toughest political issues, voted 374-39 Tuesday to give the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> a chance to save money by shutting down unneeded military bases. The chamber passed a complicated plan that involves having an independent commission decide which bases to close. `` For too many years, obsolete military bases have been treated as sacred cows and the country can not afford this anymore,'' Rep. <PERSON> Chalmers </PERSON> <PERSON> Wylie </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ohio </LOCATION>, told his colleagues. `` The time has come for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to stiffen its backbone.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> estimates that between $ 2 billion and $ 5 billion a year can be saved if the military is allowed to close installations it says are obsolete. But bases mean jobs and since 1977 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has enacted a stiff and complex series of laws that have prevented the Pentagon from shutting down any of the 3,800 military installations in the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The plan approved Tuesday calls for a nine-member commission, which will makes its recommendations to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> by next Dec. 31. The president would then have until Jan. 16, four days before leaving office, to either accept or reject the entire list. He could not approve a partial list. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> could block the closures by a majority vote in both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> backs the plan and has already appointed a nine-member commission, which has been meeting for the past month. The commission will also study the 1,900 military installations maintained by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in foreign nations, but will not have authority to recommend closures there. In approving the plan, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rejected a different base-closing proposal, which would have retained a few of the current restrictions. The version approved Tuesday was first adopted on a 223-186 vote shortly before the final passage. The House action sends the bill to a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION> to resolve differences with a Senate-passed version. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> measure was approved as an amendment to a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget bill, but was later dropped out of that legislation. In the decades after World War II, when the nation was winding down from its large military structure, the Pentagon was usually allowed to what it wanted on the issue, with the exception of a handful of bases protected by key members. Between 1961 and 1977, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> shut down 3,600 installations. But in 1975, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> proposed shutting down <ORGANIZATION> Loring </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in northern <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. That state's legislators blocked the move by requiring lengthy _ and costly _ environmental impact studies for the <PERSON> Loring </PERSON> closure and all future closings. Rep. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Armey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, chief sponsor of the base-closing plan, said the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> action `` will go a long way toward cutting fat instead of muscle from our national defense.'' <PERSON> Armey </PERSON>'s plan was rejected a year ago, 199-192, but he offered the proposal again because he argued that a lame-duck administration might be willing to approve the unpopular cuts. Rep. <PERSON> Toby </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, R-Wis., urged approval of the bill because he said `` it's time to cut the pork out of the budget process ... it's the right thing for the country Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> AuCoin </PERSON>, D-Ore., agreed, saying: `` This whole program of bases is not a welfare program ... it's not an economic program We should have bases for one reason and one reason only _ because they serve military needs.'' In working through the bill, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted down, on a voice vote, a proposed amendment that would have required the closure of foreign bases before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases are shut down. The chamber also rejected, on another voice vote, a move that would have added four members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to the commission.

 A defendant in a Contra arms-smuggling indictment blasted the charges against him Tuesday as a whitewash aimed at covering up illegal activities of <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Terrell </PERSON>, a one-time mercenary who turned against the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> policy and then cooperated with investigators, said he was informed Tuesday he has been charged in a <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> indictment still sealed by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office here. The indictment handed up last month is believed to accuse a small number of men with violating the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Neutrality Act by conspiring to aid the Contras to overthrow the Nicaraguan government. `` I have some news for this administration,'' <PERSON> Terrell </PERSON> said in a statement released in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` I wo n't take the fall for <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> or <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Terrell </PERSON> said the indictments were returned only because <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> got wind that <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s then-U.S. Attorney <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON> was trying to stop the investigation at the behest of Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> investigated charges that the probe was sidetracked, but did not reach any conclusion. `` Clearly, the only reason why the -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- attorney's office sought these indictments is to protect itself,'' said <PERSON> Terrell </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON> `` could n't admit that his investigation was a farce, and that he and his staff had participated in a coverup.'' He said he had been cooperating with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney for two years, giving information about high-level involvement in the illegal supply network, but wound up being one of the few indicted. `` That's what I call shooting the messenger,'' he said. <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON> has quit the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney's office here and will be practicing law in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. But he has previously denied charges that he stonewalled the investigation, and said a congressional committee that took testimony from prosecutors in his office failed to find evidence that he slowed the investigation at <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s request <PERSON> Terrell </PERSON>, who most recently worked for a liberal policy group in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, became a vocal opponent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy in Central America. North eventually targeted him for his anti-Contra activities, according to notes released during the Iran-Contra affair. Until he changed his mind on aid to the Contras, <PERSON> Terrell </PERSON> aided Civilian Materiel Assistance in its efforts to help the Nicaraguan rebels. <ORGANIZATION> CMA </ORGANIZATION>'s head <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Posey </PERSON> has previously said he expects to be indicted along with <PERSON> Terrell </PERSON>, and has also said he was working to aid the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration.

 Weather conditions have been favorable for a bumper grain harvest in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, in contrast to damage done by heat and drought to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crops, a report by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> showed Tuesday. Precipitation was above normal in most of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> area, the report said And more than twice the amount of normal rain soaked crops in many of the other grain areas. Thus, the report said, total Soviet grain production this year continues to be forecast at 215 million metric tons, the report said. That would be the third year in a row that Soviet harvests have exceeded 200 million tons, an unprecedented string of bumper yields. It also would be the third largest Soviet grain harvest, exceeded by the record crop of 237.4 million tons in 1978 and the 1976 harverst of 223.8 million tons. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.6 bushels of wheat or 39.4 bushels of corn, as examples. Despite the bumper harvest, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> continues to import grain to help rebuild stockpiles and to make more available for an expanding livestock sector. In a related announcement, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> said the Soviets have bought an additional 350,000 tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn for delivery this year under a long-term supply agreement between the two countries. That would be about 13.8 million bushels. Corn prices have been averaging about $ 2.76 per bushel at the farm level, meaning that the sale could have a farm value of around $ 38 million. The corn is part of the grain the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is committed to buy during the fifth and final year of the agreement, which calls for the annual purchase of at least 9 million tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain. The pact expires Sept. 30, and there have been negotiations for a new one.

 Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>'s selection as the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee sent local pride surging in his hometown 10 miles from the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> border, where the family name stands for wealth and power. `` Everybody knows the <LOCATION> Bentsens </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, just like the du Ponts or Kennedys -LRB- in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Justo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, who owns a barber shop in downtown Mission. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the certain Democratic presidential nominee, announced in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> on Tuesday that he had designated <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> as his running mate. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> and other local boosters said the nomination will bring recognition to the Lower <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. `` It will put us on the map, and as chambers of commerce, we are always interested in that sort of notoriety,'' said <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> <PERSON> Benavides </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. The city of 25,000 in <LOCATION> Hidalgo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> was settled by Europeans in 1824, when the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oblate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fathers </ORGANIZATION> began occupying an area three miles south of the current city. Its name comes from a mission the Oblates later built there. It is the center of the subtropical <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> citrus producing area, and nearly surrounded by grapefruit groves and other farming operations. Mobile home and recreational vehicle parks mix dot the landscape, and retirees from the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> inflate Mission's population during the winter to more than 50,000. The Lower <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, actually a delta of the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION>, also has some of the poorest residents of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Some local officials were angered during a campaign swing by <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, when the candidate described an unincorporated rural subdivision as a `` little <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>.'' Mission's population is about 85 percent Mexican American, a figure that probably would be higher without the real estate promotions and business ventures of <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> Sr. The elder <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> at age 94 still oversees about 42,000 acres of farms and six ranches scattered over <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, an empire he started carving out of the brush country in 1920. `` My children all grew up learning how to work,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON> said Tuesday. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, like his two younger brothers and one sister, worked `` mostly in the nurseries and of course spraying the orchards, and working on the ranches and working cattle, the whole thing,'' the proud father said. `` Lloyd do n't think he's a conservative; he thinks he's a moderate,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said as geese swam by on the 27-acre lake behind his family's sprawling ranch house south of Mission. `` I should n't show this to anyone. It makes the environmentalists mad,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said, opening the door to a trophy room that includes the skins of a tiger, polar bears, brown bears and grizzlies, along with a bison's head and other game. `` I do n't know that much about <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. What I hear is he's probably more liberal in his viewpoints than <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> is,'' the elder <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said `` It will help to balance the ticket.''

 Opposition presidential candidate <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON> and about 150 supporters scuffled with presidential guards on Tuesday in the heart of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, then staged a sit-in to protest alleged electoral fraud. As President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> arrived at the Fine Arts Palace for a speech to about 2,500 lawyers, <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON> stood up, carrying a sign that read, `` Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, keep your word.'' The sit-in went on while de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> spoke inside. Results from last Wednesday's elections released by the governing <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> showed its lowest proportion of the vote since its founding 59 years ago. The party, known by its Spanish initials <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>, generally wins the presidency with at least 70 percent of the vote. The figures indicated, however, that this time the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> will take the presidency by only slightly more than 50 percent of the vote and will pay little heed to opposition protests of election fraud. The white-bearded, heavy-set <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON>, a businessman and rancher, is the candidate of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. He was running third in unofficial, partial returns from last Wednesday's elections. <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON> and the other top opposition candidate, <PERSON> Cuauhtemoc </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, claim the government is rigging the vote count in favor of the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>. De la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> had pledged clean elections. Government and party officials are calling the vote the cleanest ever in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON> vowed to lead sit-ins at every event where de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> or <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> is scheduled to appear, as part of a national civil disobedience campaign to protest the alleged fraud. He said earlier he would file criminal charges against the head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Registry </ORGANIZATION>. Carrying signs reading `` Punishment for electoral criminals'' and `` Total repudiation of the electoral fraud,'' the group pushed past a line of about 50 plainclothes presidential guards who tried to stop them. After a scuffle, the group sat down at the entrance to the ornate, landmark building in downtown <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the only source of official results, adjourned early Tuesday and said it would not meet again until Wednesday night. Seven days after the elections, it was releasing official results only on balloting for the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, the lower house of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. With the vote count lagging, the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> again released data it said came from the federal commission. Those results showed <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> had 53.59 percent of the votes counted. <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> was second with 26.08 percent and <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON> had 16.04 percent. Two candidates for small parties and null ballots accounted for the remainder. Those results showed a turnout of 51.7 percent in the 235 of the 300 districts tallied, the government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nacional </ORGANIZATION> said. But original reports claimed an exceptionally high turnout. Earlier, the government and the governing party had blamed the high turnout for the slowness of the vote count. Turnout was officially placed at 75 percent in the last presidential race in 1982. But strong candidates and active campaigns on the left and right spurred voter interest in the July 6 race. <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> charged on Monday that the election officials were not counting many of the votes that had been cast for opposition candidates. <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> claims he won, based on figures he says came from unidentified <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> officials. <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> senator and <LOCATION> Michoacan </LOCATION> state governor, led a dissident movement within the governing party before breaking away last year to accept the candidacy of other parties. Ballots are counted at polling places immediately after the election, but according to law those for the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> and for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> must be processed before those for president in an official count. The only returns released officially by the commission so far gave 241 of the 500 seats in the chamber to the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>, 32 to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and 10 to parties that support <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>. The results were from 283 of the 300 electoral districts. Victories by parties supporting <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> were in the state of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, which surrounds <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Michoacan </LOCATION>. Victories for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> were in the western state of <LOCATION> Jalisco </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>, which is the core of the <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> metropolitan area, and the northern border state of <LOCATION> Chihuahua </LOCATION>. The governing party has not lost a presidential, senate or gubernatorial race since it was founded in 1929.

<HEAD>Military Tribunal Battles Pentagon Attempt to Investigate Bribe
Allegations</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A military tribunal is fighting the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s attempt to investigate an anonymous allegation that bribery influenced its decision overturning a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> heart surgeon's convictions for the deaths of three The <ORGANIZATION> Navy-Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> obtained an order from the <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> temporarily barring the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s inspector general from proceeding with the investigation. The military appeals court, which originally granted the temporary injunction June 30, extended the order Monday for 15 days pending its final decision in the matter. At issue, says <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carome </PERSON>, a lawyer appointed to represent the tribunal, is the independence of military courts from interference by the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s command hierarchy. `` The judges feel this is a situation in which command influence or at least the appearance of it is being brought to bear'' on the tribunal's unpopular decision to set aside the negligent homicide and involuntary manslaughter convictions of Cmdr. <PERSON> Donal </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Billig </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carome </PERSON> said. On April 13, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy-Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> tribunal overturned <PERSON> Billig </PERSON>'s conviction and accused <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> prosecutors of waging a `` smear campaign'' against the surgeon, who had practiced at the <ORGANIZATION> Bethesda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> outside <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> At a hearing Monday, Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Muschamp </PERSON> told the military appeals court that <PERSON> Billig </PERSON>'s conviction could not be revived even if the bribery allegations were proven. But <PERSON> June </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbs </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s inspector general, told the military review tribunal June 23 that the investigation could affect its <PERSON> Billig </PERSON> ruling `` if the decision was procured by bribery or fraud,'' according to court papers. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> told the court `` there is no indication of any criminal misconduct'' by the judges or the court staff, according to a summary of her remarks to the judges. The allegation, received from an anonymous tipster who called the inspector general's hotline May 2, has not been detailed by <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> authorities. The tipster has been interviewed several times but <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> authorities have not identified the person, according to court papers. At Monday's hearing, <PERSON> Muschamp </PERSON> said the investigation would involve only whether there was an improper outside attempt to influence the court. Investigators would be careful not to intrude in the decision-making process of the court. But <PERSON> Carome </PERSON> argued that a special judicial commission, not the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> inspector general, should conduct any investigation to preserve the independence of the military court. `` Allowing the inspector general mechanism to kick into high gear and focus in on a court in a particular decision in a particular case based on a simple anonymous tip and nothing more, really sets up a situation in which disgruntled parties after a case can utilize this mechanism to harass and interfere with the judicial process,'' <PERSON> Carome </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` There are a lot of people at the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and the Pentagon who are unhappy with the result'' in the <PERSON> Billig </PERSON> case, he said.

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government postponed the executions of the <LOCATION> Sharpeville </LOCATION> Six indefinitely Tuesday and Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> promised a new plea for clemency by world leaders. Justice Minister <PERSON> Kobie </PERSON> <PERSON> Coetsee </PERSON> said the executions by hanging of the six blacks were delayed so the <ORGANIZATION> Appellate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s highest tribunal, can respond to their appeals The last stay of execution for the five men and one woman was until July 19. They were convicted in the mob killing of a town council member in the <LOCATION> Sharpeville </LOCATION> black township, and originally were scheduled to die in March. The six had originally been sentenced to hang in March. Their convictions were based on the principle of `` common purpose.'' They were part of a crowd that stoned and burned town councilor <PERSON> Kuzwayo </PERSON> <PERSON> Dlamini </PERSON> to death in September 1984. Intense controversy surrounds the death sentences because the six were cleared of directly causing victim's death, and because violence against a town councilor who cooperated with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s apartheid policy of racial segregation is considered by many to be a political crime. Many foreign leaders have asked President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> to grant clemency to the six: <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Mokgesi </PERSON>, 31; <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> <PERSON> Mokoena </PERSON>, 24; <PERSON> Oupa </PERSON> <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> <PERSON> Diniso </PERSON>, 32; <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramashamola </PERSON>, 27; <PERSON> Duma </PERSON> <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> <PERSON> Khumalo </PERSON>, 28, and <PERSON> Reginald </PERSON> <PERSON> Sefatsa </PERSON>, 32. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> refused to intervene in March Supreme Court Judge <PERSON> Willem </PERSON> <PERSON> Human </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Transvaal </LOCATION> province, who had sentenced them, granted a temporary stay hours before the time of execution at <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> Central Prison. Defense attorneys said the trial should be reopened because some witnesses had said police forced them to give false testimony. One prosecution witness, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Manete </PERSON>, wrote to <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> last week that he was assaulted and threatened by police to falsely identify two of the accused as being at the scene of <PERSON> Dlamini </PERSON>'s death. He said other state witnesses also were `` unhappy with their testimony'' against the <ORGANIZATION> Sharpeville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Six </ORGANIZATION> and begged <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> to stop the executions. Judge Human decided June 13 not to reopen the case because, he said, the court had not relied solely on the suspect witnesses' testimony He added that allegations of police influence on other prosecution witnesses were `` absurd.'' He gave the defendants until July 19 to challenge the death sentences in the <ORGANIZATION> Appellate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which had upheld his decision not to reopen the trial. Some South African commentators have suggested the intense international campaign on behalf of the defendants makes it more difficult for <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> to grant clemency because he may appear to be giving in to foreign pressure. <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Mokgesi </PERSON>, whose brother <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> is one of those condemned, met with Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> on Tuesday. She promised that to make another appeal for clemency if the high court upholds the death sentences. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> and the world's seven major industrialized nations would join the appeal. The defendants were convicted under laws passed by the South African <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, which has no black representation, and sentenced by a judicial system that excludes black judges. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> added to the controversy by saying last March he could not grant clemency because he did not want to interfere in the judicial process. A few days later, however, he stopped the trial of six South African soldiers accused of causing the death of a black activist in <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, a territory controlled by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. In June, Justice Minister <PERSON> Coetsee </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> the president had commuted 115 death sentences between 1983 and the end of 1987.

 It was nearly midnight when <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> asked the four advisers at his kitchen table for recommendations on the potential running mates they had been discussing. The unanimous verdict: Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` That's my choice,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. With that, the selection process that began June 8 ended. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would ask the Democratic National Convention to nominate <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> as his running mate in the effort to capture the White House in November. A key figure at the table was <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> lawyer and former <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> classmate who headed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> search. After <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s name was announced on Tuesday, <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> described what had happened. The decision made, it was decided to notify the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator immediately. `` We put a call in and there was no answer,'' said <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON>. `` We put a second call in around quarter to twelve and there was no answer.'' What they did n't know was that <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was home but had turned off his telephone because he had been getting so many late night calls from reporters chasing the vice presidential selection story. At 6:30 on Tuesday morning, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was shaving when the telephone rang. It was <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> offering him the No. 2 spot on the Democratic ticket. Despite <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s professed indifference to such an offer, <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> said that when he met with the senator in mid-June <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> `` indicated to me he would accept if asked.'' The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> adviser said that when he arrived at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' <LOCATION> Brookline </LOCATION> home Monday night the decision was still open and that he did not mislead <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> when he told him <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> still was under consideration Asked at a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> news conference if he was angry, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> replied: `` No, I'm too controlled, I'm too clear, I'm too mature to be angry. I'm focused on what we must do to keep hope alive.'' In <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> the night before, seated around the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> kitchen table along with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> were <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the governor's wife; <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON>, his campaign manager, and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Corrigan </PERSON>, the deputy campaign manager During the primary season, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> kept insisting he would not begin thinking about a running mate until after he had clinched the nomination. `` That was true,'' said <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON>, who said he tried to raise the matter with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> the night of June 7 _ the last night of the primary season _ and was told to wait until breakfast the next morning. <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> presented <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with a long memo outlining the various considerations and then began the weeks of information gathering. He said he gained the confidence of the 200 or so people he consulted by describing himself as `` a committee of one'' who would pass information only to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. He assembled a team of lawyers and tax accountants to investigate the individuals who were the finalists for consideration. <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> refused to discuss the reasons any of the others were not chosen over <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> except to say `` no one was eliminated from consideration as a result of the background checks.'' The day of the decision, <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to meet with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. His return flight was canceled by a thunderstorm, but he managed to catch a later flight and arrived at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' home between 10:30 p.m. and 11 p.m. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, looking unflappable, mowed his lawn in the dark as he waited for his close friend and adviser to appear. As he methodically criss-crossed the yard with his push mower night, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor gave no hint how close he was to ending the growing speculation over his choice for a running mate. But there were other signs that a decision was near. Newsmen clustered in front of the house on <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Street </PERSON> saw <PERSON> Estrich </PERSON> and <PERSON> Corrigan </PERSON>, join <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> inside the house. Meanwhile, Democrats were arriving in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> to nominate <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for president, and the big topic of conversation was speculation about his choice for a running mate. The name getting the most mention was that of Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, the former astronaut who became a national hero when he was the first American to orbit Earth. But the people who mattered the most were n't in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. They were in <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' home in <LOCATION> Brookline </LOCATION>. It was tight circle of five _ the governor, his most trusted adviser <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON>, his two campaign aides, and his wife, <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON>. It had not been an easy day for <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> lawyer who headed the vice presidential talent hunt. His principal order of business in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was a meeting with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, and according to one participant <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> assured <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> he was `` under serious consideration.'' As soon as their meeting ended, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told reporters that if offered the No. 2 spot on the Democratic ticket, `` I would accept it.'' But despite <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON>' assurances to the former civil rights leader, one of the safest bets about the process was that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would not get that offer. In addition to <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, the names on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' list were Sens <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and Reps. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> remained a subject of speculation despite his insistence he was n't interested in the job. Each of the prospects had a moment or two in the sun when rumors flared that they were gaining favor. But each time <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was asked about the latest rumors he brushed them aside saying that only he and <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> were qualified to speak authoritatively, and they were n't talking

 Participants in a civil rights anniversary march on <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> next month will be `` on the offensive'' to send the presidential candidates a message, the Rev. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` It's not only a commemorative service,'' <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON> said of the march planned 25 years after the landmark civil rights conclave culminated by the late <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>'s famous `` I have a dream'' speech in 1963. `` After seven long, hard, difficult years of opposing this administration's efforts to dismantle affirmative action and reverse civil rights laws, there is a need now ... to go on the offensive,'' said <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, the organization once headed by King. `` This march is an opportunity for people to ... convince the leaders of this incoming administration, whomsoever they may be, that the top priority items must be full employment and adequate wages,'' he said. `` We think it's important on this the 25th anniversay of the dream to come to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and say not only that we still have a dream but we have the determination to see the dream through,'' <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON> and King's widow, <PERSON> Coretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> are the co-convenors of the march, which has more than 80 supporting civil rights, human rights, women's, religious and labor organizations.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> agreed to delay a <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> meeting on the downed Iranian airliner, largely on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s initiative because it could not muster a majority for condemnation, diplomats said Tuesday. A majority vote in the 15-nation council would force the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to use its veto to stop a resolution of condemnation. The meeting, originally scheduled for Tuesday, has been postponed until Thursday morning. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> told reporters he did not believe <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had the votes to condemn the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for shooting down the airliner July 3 in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. All 290 people aboard were killed. <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> spoke after meeting with Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, who later conferred with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali-Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> left the building without speaking to reporters. `` I do n't think it -LRB- a resolution of condemnation -RRB- was a matter of serious consideration because I do n't think they can get the votes for it,'' <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said in answer to a question. `` Everyone knows perfectly well this was not a premedidated act. Everybody knows the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> is investigating. Everybody knows the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is a completely transparent country in which the findings of our investigation will become known in a very short time.'' Perez de Cuellar spent more than an hour each with <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> and <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON>, prompting speculation about an attempt to bring the sides together. The council meeting was postponed Monday night by Ambassador <PERSON> Paulo </PERSON> <PERSON> Nogueira-Batista </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, the president for July, after consultations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and other members. It is expected to hear speakers Thursday but the agenda is not known. The official reason for the postponement was that more time was needed for consultations and preparations. Officials also cited the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> meeting Wednesday in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> on the shooting down of the airliner by the cruiser USS Vincennes fired a missile at the civilian aircraft. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says the crew mistook the <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> for an Iranian F-14 fighter. Diplomatic sources said privately both the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> want to avoid a showdown in the council. They said plans for a resolution apparently have been scrapped and delegates were working on a milder letter from the council president that would be approved by concensus. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had said it wants the council to condemn the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military action, demand withdrawal of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces from the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and call for reparations. The sources said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> effectively preempted <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> by offering compensation to families of the victims and by expressing deep regret. Any resolution condemning the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was expected to be vetoed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. The other two permanent members of the council, who also have veto power, are the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Current non-permanent members of the council are <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>.

 The Soviet Foreign Ministry on Tuesday told the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador and a <LOCATION> Pakistani </LOCATION> envoy that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s harboring of a rival Afghan government violates the international agreement on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Afghan rebel groups based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> announced last month the creation of a government and demanded the ouster of President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, the pro-Soviet Afghan leader. First Deputy Foreign Ministry <PERSON> Yuli </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> called <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON> and Pakistani Charge d'Affairs <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> to his offices for separate meetings, ministry spokesman <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> Perfilyev </PERSON> said. It was not a threat of possible Soviet military retaliation, <PERSON> Perfilyev </PERSON> added. It was the latest in a series of statements by the Soviets denouncing <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, where most of the Moslem guerrillas fighting <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s Marxist government have bases. <PERSON> Perfilyev </PERSON> said at a news briefing that the ministry's statement is `` made for the sole purpose of showing to the government of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and to public opinion the vital need to implement the agreements.'' The U.N.-mediated Afghan agreement, signed April 14 in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, commits the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to begin withdrawing its more than 100,000 military personnel from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The Soviet withdrawal began May 15 and is to be completed within 10 months. The accords also commit <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> not to interfere in each other's affairs. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> are listed as guarantors of the agreement. The Moslem rebels did not sign the pact. In <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, reports said there was fighting around three provincial cities. Soviet troops entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 to help the government battle the rebels, who have received support from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Perfilyev </PERSON> said <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> told <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> that the creation of a transitional Afghan government on Pakistani soil is a violation of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement. He reported <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> as saying: `` The consequences of the violations will be borne by the Pakistani side totally.'' <PERSON> Perfilyev </PERSON> added, `` Imagine the situation where somebody tried to form an American government outside the territory of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, for example, in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON>, an employee at the Pakistani Mission, said <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> had been called to the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> by <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON>, but <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> said he could not disclose what happened at the meeting. <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> also delivered a `` verbal note'' to <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON> in a separate meeting, complaining of the `` new destructive action'' by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Perfilyev </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Marguerite </PERSON> <PERSON> Squire </PERSON> said the meeting had occurred but the embassy did not comment on diplomatic discussions. <PERSON> Perfilyev </PERSON> said <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> told <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON> that Pakistani actions violate the Afghan accords and the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> hoped <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> would do everything in its power `` to influence <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> to end its interference in <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> affairs and abide by its <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> obligations.'' In an interview published Sunday, the Soviet commander in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> said the withdrawal timetable for his troops could be affected. `` We are prepared to continue to implement strictly and faithfully the provisions of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreements,'' Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromov </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Krasnaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zvezda </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. `` Although I do not rule out that unceasing violations of the provisions by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> may lead ... to a situation when appropriate conclusions will be made as regards the timetable of the troop withdrawal,'' he was quoted as saying. In <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, Western diplomatic sources said fighting continued for control of provincial and district capitals, but the guerrillas were not occupying the cities because of retaliatory bombings and shelling by Soviet and Afghan groops. <PERSON> Gulbaddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>, leader of one of the Afghan resistance parties with headquarters in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> said, `` We can keep the cities but at the price of heavy casualties.'' Rebel leaders reported their forces seized and then withdrew from the capitals of <LOCATION> Zabul </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Wardak </PERSON> provinces. <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s second largest city of <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION>, 310 miles southwest of the capital of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, has been under siege for two months and Western diplomats said the government is warning residents against cooperating with the guerrillas

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> approved legislation Tuesday that would change the oft-criticized federal budget process by putting it into a two-year cycle. The measure would appear to have lttle chance of being enacted this year. The proposal is a controversial one, and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has a short schedule this year because of the presidential and congressional elections. Under the bill, which was approved by a 9-0 vote, the budget resolution that charts the government's finances and the spending and tax bills that flesh out those plans would cover two years. Currently, those measures cover only one year. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would spend the second year of the new budget process reviewing spending decisions. Sen. <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, D-Ky., the measure's sponsor, and his supporters have argued that with the present single-year process, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> spends too much time bogged down on budget matters and not enough time scrutinizing its fiscal decisions `` It is not too much to ask that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the executive branch take one year in each <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to ensure that abuse is caught and dealt with before it becomes a public scandal,'' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said in a written statement. Proponents also say that with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> consistently passing spending bills late _ well into the fiscal year for much of the 1980s _ federal agencies must operate in a state of confusion over what their budgets will be. This makes planning for the agencies difficult. Such legislation has been introduced in the past. It consistently runs into opposition from lawmakers who argue that two-year budgeting would be too inflexible, making it hard to adjust to sudden emergencies or changes in the economy's performance Members of the Budget and Appropriations committees can be expected to jealously guard their legislative turf against a bill that would diminish their authority. The legislation now must be considered by the budget panel. In addition, Democrats may want to wait to see how <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, should he become president, would feel about such an alteration to the budget process.

<TEXT>
 A federal report was optimistic when it projected the 1988 corn crop would shrink by 2.04 billion bushels over last year and soybeans would produce 250 million fewer bushels, state and private crop forecasters said Tuesday. One private forecaster called the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> report unrealistic and others said it was too soon to accurately measure damage to crops from the prolonged drought gripping the farm belt. The report released Tuesday said the corn crop may be off 1987's production of 7.06 billion bushels by 26 percent at 5.2 billion bushels and the soybean crop may drop from 1987's 1.9 billion bushels to 1.65 billion bushels Experts in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, the nation's top two corn-producing states, stood by predictions their states could lose half their corn to the extreme heat and drought. `` We could lose 50 percent and possibly more if we get an extended period of high temperatures, low humidity and wind,'' said <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Harl </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> economist. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Werries </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>, said the federal projections `` are way too high'' if state officials are correct. `` Maybe we'll raise that much corn nationwide, but <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> wo n't contribute very much,'' <PERSON> Werries </PERSON> said. `` We're worse off in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> than they anticipate. `` We're not any better than 60 bushels per acre, which is half of our average for the last five years.'' <PERSON> Werries </PERSON> said the federal soybean projections may be closer to the truth because the bean crop is not at as critical a stage as the corn. `` They may be a little on the high side but with beans it's harder to tell,'' said <PERSON> Werries </PERSON> `` There's still some potential for soybeans. We may be able to get three-fourths our normal crop in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>.'' In the deep South, which also has been ravaged by drought and heat, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> Agriculture Commissioner <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Irvin </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> projections represented a `` substantial reduction'' and were not unexpected. `` The early corn has been absolutely devastated,'' <PERSON> Irvin </PERSON> said of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s crops. `` There are still prospects for -LRB- soybeans -RRB- to make a good recovery.'' <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON>, vice president for <ORGANIZATION> Balfour </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maclaine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a commodities trading company, disagreed with the government's predictions on corn `` In all probability, the corn crop will be lower and the carryover -LRB- surplus, predicted by the government to be 4 billion bushels -RRB- will be lower. The corn figures, I think, we're going to view with some skepticism,'' <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON> said. `` We're not supposed to do that with government reports, but I do n't think we can help it,'' he added. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> also predicted consumer food prices would be 3 percent to 5 percent higher because of the drought, but <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Basse </PERSON>, crop analyst for <ORGANIZATION> GNP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said those figures were too low. `` I think they're being too modest in their estimates of the inflationary impact of the drought,'' <PERSON> Basse </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> also rank one-and-two in soybean production in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` The more modest reduction in soybeans is in line with expectations that soybeans provide a much greater opportunity for recovery,'' said <PERSON> Harl </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> officials said the national projections did n't accurately reflect the situation in their states. `` I'd say we'll have about a 60 percent corn crop, an 80 percent soybean crop and maybe a 40 percent wheat crop,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> state agriculture commissioner. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Mengel </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Purdue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> agronomist, estimated <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>'s corn crop loss at 30 percent <PERSON> Kirby </PERSON> <PERSON> Hidy </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, called the federal report `` a little optimistic.'' `` We would expect corn production in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> to be reduced by as much as 50 percent,'' <PERSON> Hidy </PERSON> said. The projections of a 13 percent soybean drop are probably accurate for <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, he said.

The embassy also said <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> traveled alone, not with five <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats as the state-run <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nicaragua </ORGANIZATION> had reported, and that the seven others will leave Thursday. The leftist Sandinista government on Monday expelled the eight diplomats and told them they had 72 hours to leave the country. It accused them of `` criminal acts against the Nicaraguan people.'' According to the government, the eight were fomenting dissent and helped organize a large anti-government demonstration last Sunday that ended in violence. Some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy personnel attended the rally, but the embassy said it was normal for its diplomats to maintain contact with Nicaraguans. Also Monday, the government closed the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s radio station, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catolica </ORGANIZATION>, and shut down for 15 days the only opposition newspaper, <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> The actions marked a sharp setback in democratic reforms made in recent months to comply with a regional peace plan. In announcing <PERSON> Melton </PERSON>'s departure, the <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nicaragua </ORGANIZATION> said sarcastically that `` many people of the Nicaraguan right and the director of <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Violeta </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>, are crying at this time because of the departure of their ambassador.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> retaliated by ordering <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s ambassador and seven other diplomats out of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The Nicaraguan government identified the other expelled Americans as <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Creamer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Delvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Junker </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hope </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>. `` We are disposed to accept a new ambassador less addicted to the psychopathic orientations of -LRB- Assistant Secretary of State for <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> -RRB- <PERSON> Elliot </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>,'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Escoto </PERSON> said Monday. President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said the decision was made so the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would `` learn to respect this country and its people.'' He added <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> was `` prepared to confront any type of American escalation'' as a result. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> statement said the ousters follow `` a series of repressive actions directed against the political opposition, labor and press in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' An <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> statement charged <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> with violating internal security and national defense. It said the newspaper incited violence and subverted public order. The headline of Monday's <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> was `` <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> the People,'' reporting on Sunday's demonstration. It carried another article headlined: `` Accounts of a Brutal Attack by the Police.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> also claim La Prensa is the `` voice of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>.'' The paper receives <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> funding through the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catolica </ORGANIZATION>'s programming included Cardinal <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y <ORGANIZATION> Bravo </ORGANIZATION>'s homily in which he defended `` the right of the people to civic protest.'' Grumblings against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy involvement in internal <LOCATION> Nicaraguan </LOCATION> affairs began last week. Sandinista officials said they had discovered a `` Plan <PERSON> Melton </PERSON>'' that sought to create an internal front of dissident. The <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> said part of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan to destabilize the government was put into effect Sunday in <LOCATION> Nandaime </LOCATION>, a town 40 miles south of the capital. Fighting broke out between security forces and some of the estimated 10,000 demonstrators. Sandinista newspapers ran a picture of <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>, one of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats expelled, at the protest with his fist raised. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartman </PERSON> said the picture was taken as <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> was summoning a group of Americans back to the cars to leave. The Embassy statement said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats `` maintain contact with as wide a spectrum of Nicaraguan citizens as possible'' and noted that such `` activities are the normal duties of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> officials overseas.'' The Sandinistas also have accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of responsibility for recent rebel attacks that violate the March 21 cease-fire. The government and the rebels, known as Contras, have been at war for almost seven years. They signed the agreement to seek a negotiated settlement to the war but the talks are at an impasse. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has backed and trained the rebels since 1981. The government had pushed ahead with a regional peace plan outline signed last August by the presidents of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. It called for democratic liberties, cease-fires and an end to supporting insurgencies in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. As part of its compliance, the government had allowed the reopening of <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catolica </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> and permitted opposition demonstrations, including the one last week.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on Tuesday launched its second spacecraft in a week toward Mars in an ambitious program to unlock mysteries of the red planet and its largest moon, <LOCATION> Phobos </LOCATION>. Orange flames flared in the night sky over <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> as a <ORGANIZATION> Proton </ORGANIZATION> booster rocket sent the unmanned Phobos II vehicle on a 111 million-mile voyage to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>. Arrival is expected in January. Soviet television showed a recording during its evening news broadcast of the launch of Phobos II at 9:01 p.m. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> time -LRB- 1:01 p.m. EDT -RRB- from a pad at the Baikonur Cosmodrome on the steppes of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. Phobos I was launched last Thursday and the media said its on-board navigation systems were activated the next day. Television showed flags of more than dozen nations, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, flying at Baikonur. The countries are participating in the mission that is designed to send the two space probes close to the <LOCATION> Phobos </LOCATION> moon and drop instruments onto the surface. Scientists said the mission might provide clues to how the universe was formed. They have said that if Phobos is an asteroid trapped by Mars' gravity, as many scientists believe, the probes will be able to study matter that is little changed since the infancy of the solar system billions of years ago The two Soviet spacecraft are to enter the gravitational pull of Mars in January and fall into orbit just behind Phobos for a three-month study of the Martian surface, atmosphere and magnetic field. In April, the two craft will drop out of their orbit and swoop to within 100 feet of Phobos' surface and release two 100-pound `` landers.'' In one experiment, a laser beam carried by a lander is designed to split off a tiny piece of Phobos' rocky surface and trap it for close examination. One of the landers is expected to operate for about a year in a stationary position, sending back data. The other is planned to bound like a superkangaroo about Phobos in 65-foot leaps, gathering and analyzing soil samples. Soviet scientists have said the Phobos mission is an important step toward a manned flight to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>, which they believe may be possible early in the 21st century. Officials have placed the cost of the Phobos mission at $ 480 million. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s Deep Space Network will provide radio-tracking data to help the spacecraft locate Phobos, which is only about 17 miles in diameter.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officer testified Tuesday that the seized cargo ship Encounter Bay was loaded with 72 tons of marijuana off <LOCATION> Danang </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, in early June and that the Vietnamese army was involved in the operation. Lt. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, the law enforcement officer on the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> cutter <PERSON> Boutwell </PERSON>, made the disclosure at a detention hearing for the 18 crewmen of the Encounter Bay. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> knew `` there was approximately 143,000 pounds of high-grade Thai marijuana loaded off <LOCATION> Danang </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, sometime during the first 10 days of June,'' <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said. Asked by defense attorney <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mair </PERSON> what else he knew about the loading, <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said, `` The only additional information I can recall is that the Vietnamese army was involved.'' <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> disclosed the Vietnamese connection just before the hearing was suspended for the day. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Assistant Attorney <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Diskin </PERSON> declined to comment on the disclosure after the hearing. `` I was shocked'' at the revelation, said <PERSON> Mair </PERSON>, attorney for <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sayers </PERSON>, 53, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, one of the crew. The Panamanian-registered ship was seized 500 miles off the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> coast on June 30 in what the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said was the largest maritime bust ever on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. The crew _ three Americans, one from <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, one from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> and 13 from <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> _ have been charged with intent to distribute marijuana. Defense lawyers have argued that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government ca n't prove that the crew knew what the cargo was and that there was n't probable cause to stop the ship The Encounter Bay carried documents showing it had left <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> on June 5 or 6, but <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said he did n't know whether that was the vessel's last port of call. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said he did n't know whether the crew got on board before or after the vessel received its cargo, or whether documentation found on board would answer the question. He also testified that he believed the crew members were read their Miranda rights but that he did n't know whether the rights, probably read in English, were understood by the crewmen from <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON> would not allow questions about the <PERSON> Encounter </PERSON> <PERSON> Bay </PERSON>'s destination, saying it was irrelevant to the hearing, which was only to determine whether there was enough evidence to schedule a trial. Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Muenster </PERSON>, representing <PERSON> Terrance </PERSON> <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON>, 36, of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said the question of destination was relevant because the charges against the crew require the government to prove that the ship either had left or was approaching a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> port, or was in `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs territory,'' a term that neither he nor <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> could define. On Monday, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Weitzman </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> attorney representing crew member <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Colflesh </PERSON>, 31, of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, said the ship was in international waters when seized. `` A number of constitutional issues'' are at stake, including `` the right to go out and pirate a boat,'' he said. Also Monday, <PERSON> Muenster </PERSON> questioned whether intelligence collected on the Encounter Bay had been acquired through wiretapping. `` We surmise there was wiretapping ... and if the seizure of the boat is based on wiretaps that were illegal, then the evidence ... could not be introduced in federal court,'' <PERSON> Muenster </PERSON> said.

 The last of three inmates whisked by helicopter from the state prison in a daring escape was back in custody Tuesday, and so was the pilot of the chopper, who flew the same aircraft in the movie `` Rambo III.'' Convicted murderer <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, 30, was captured in central <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> Tuesday morning after a massive search in woods. The pilot of the helicopter, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bella </PERSON>, originally had told authorities a woman hijacked him in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and forced him to fly to the prison south of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON> Chet </PERSON> <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bella </PERSON>, 43, and <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Shoemaker </PERSON> were charged Tuesday with three counts of assisting escape and one count of conspiracy to commit escape. The two appeared later Tuesday before Magistrate <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Archuleta </PERSON>, who set $ 100,000 cash bond for each. <PERSON> Bella </PERSON> pleaded innocent and the judge automatically entered an innocent plea for <PERSON> Shoemaker </PERSON>, who was not represented by an attorney. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> also filed complaints against the other two inmates who climbed aboard the helicopter Monday morning, charging each with one count of escape and one count of conspiracy. <PERSON> Bella </PERSON> was the pilot of the <ORGANIZATION> Aerospatiale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazelle </ORGANIZATION> that swooped into the prison yard, picked up the convicts and fled under a fusillade of gunfire from guards in towers. <PERSON> Bella </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shoemaker </PERSON> and the three inmates all were arrested within 16 hours of the escape. <PERSON> Carrol </PERSON> <PERSON> Bella </PERSON> said her husband, who runs a charter flight business catering mostly to television news crews and real estate salespeople, told her and police he was hijacked at gunpoint by a woman who had chartered the helicopter. She said her husband told her the woman handcuffed his hand to the helicopter's controls and forced him to pick up the three inmates. A close friend of <LOCATION> Bella </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Mobley </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, that the pilot flew stunts in the movies `` Rambo III'' and `` Extreme Prejudice.'' In `` Rambo III,'' the <LOCATION> Gazelle </LOCATION>, modified to look like a Soviet Hind helicopter, is shot down by the character played by <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallone </PERSON>. `` It's a tough case,'' <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> said, adding there was probable cause to believe <PERSON> Bella </PERSON> was involved in an escape plot. When the chopper was finally forced down at <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, after a 20-mile aerial chase, <PERSON> Bella </PERSON> was taken into custody while his story was checked out. <PERSON> Bella </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Shoemaker </PERSON>, 41, were being held at the <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. The inmates were returned to the state prison. Moments after the helicopter left the prison Monday, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> helicopter began pursuit. The fugitive helicopter landed briefly at a central <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> airport about an hour after the escape, where <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shoemaker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> <PERSON> Lackey </PERSON> jumped out. <PERSON> Lackey </PERSON> and the woman fled in different directions, said <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>. Police officers at the airport confronted <PERSON> Lackey </PERSON> as he tried to get away in a stolen pickup truck, but officers shot him in the shoulder and he was arrested, said <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Shoemaker </PERSON>, who was described by <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> as <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>'s girlfriend, was arrested later at the airport. The helicopter, meanwhile, was involved in an up-and-down, weaving chase through the skies over <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lunas </LOCATION> south of the city to a small commuter airfield north of the city and back south to the international airport. After some aerial jousting with the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> helicopter and a state police chopper flown by Maj. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Denko </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bella </PERSON> landed at the <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION> airport. He was arrested there along with the third prisoner, <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, less than two hours after the escape. <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> was serving a life sentence plus 60 years from <LOCATION> Hillsborough </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, for second-degree murder and armed robbery; <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> was serving a life sentence from <LOCATION> Summit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, for first-degree murder and <PERSON> Lackey </PERSON> was serving a nine-year sentence for larceny from <LOCATION> Curry </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> were being held in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> under an interstate compact that allows states to swap prisoners.

 Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> urged a rally of Polish and Soviet youth on Tuesday to return to the lessons of <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> and to join in <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reform movement. Opposition activists claimed riot police attacked and arrested steel workers in the southeastern town of <LOCATION> Stalowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wola </LOCATION>. They said the workers had threatened to strike during <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s visit. A government spokesman confirmed a police incident but said there were no major disturbances. Speaking at <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Wawel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Castle </ORGANIZATION>, the residence of Polish kings and queens until the late 1500s, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> repeatedly emphasized that <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>, the founder of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, could serve as a model in `` the era of the second world revolution since the birth of socialism.'' `` <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>'s life and struggle constitute a splendid example to be followed by young people ... a lesson in pursuing one's goals and being faithful to the ideal born out of love for people,'' he said. The speech was a vigorous defense of Communist ideology in a country where fewer than 1 percent of people under the age of 35 have joined the party and where young people tend to long for the material success of Western nations. Asking rhetorically, `` Has socialism fallen through?'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> answered `` No ... Not at all.'' `` We have transformed backward <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> from top to bottom and made a great power of it. And all that thanks to socialism. That would have been impossible on a different road.'' The rally came on the second day of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s six-day trip to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. The Soviet leader and his wife <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON>, who arrived in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> on Monday, flew to <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> on Tuesday to tour the city, where Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> served as archbishop before he was named pope in 1979. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> visited a mountain home near <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> where <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> lived in 1913 and 1914 while plotting the revolution that brought the <ORGANIZATION> Bolsheviks </ORGANIZATION> to power in <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> in 1917. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> often cites <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>'s pragmatic approach to economic reform as a precedent for his own policies that encourage greater openness and market-oriented reforms. In a day of sightseeing, he also went to the house where his father, a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> soldier, was hospitalized during World War II, visited one of the nation's most historic churches, <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, and chatted with the people who were allowed onto <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>'s old market square. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s 20-minute sojourn in the 14th century Roman Catholic church on the square was the first time in memory a head of the officially atheist <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> went into a working church. It reflected the lessening of the gulf between the party and religion. In April, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> received the head of the Russian Orthodox Church at the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, the first such meeting in at least 40 years and has promised a new law on relations between church and state. Some churches have been reopened and confiscated church property returned. Monsignor <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kosciolek </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION>'s said: `` We went through the main gate and we walked to the main altar. We talked about the architecture and emphasized that it was the biggest altar north of the <LOCATION> Alps </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Kosciolek </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> signed the guest book. Reporters were not allowed in the church during the visit. Activists with the banned Solidarity trade union movement said police surrounded a church Tuesday where some workers took refuge after the alleged attack Monday night in <LOCATION> Stalowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wola </LOCATION>. They said an undetermined number of people were detained by police and about 50 people had taken refuge in the church. A government spokesman, <PERSON> Ryszard </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, confirmed a `` conflict-prone situation'' at the church, but denied any organized police attack. He said at least one person was detained, and he could not rule out that some officers used clubs. The workers had threatened to strike during the <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> visit unless seven colleagues fired for leading a two-day strike in April were reinstated. On Monday, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told the Polish parliament, or <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION>, that he is moving to set the record straight about <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s rule, including supporting a drive to erect a monument in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s victims. But he indicated he is not yet prepared to accept Soviet responsibility for the massacre of about 4,300 Polish military officers in the <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> forest near the Russian city of <LOCATION> Smolensk </LOCATION> shortly after the outbreak of World War II. The <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> massacre remains a festering sore in relations between the Communist neighbors. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has never admitted responsibility for the slaughter. Each officer was bound, killed with a single bullet through the head and left to rot in a mass grave. The murdered officers had been interned by the Soviets, who accused the Nazis of the massacre. A joint study commission has been established to investigate <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> indicated Monday that he is not yet prepared to draw any concuslions.

<HEAD>Israel Inaugurates New West Bank Settlement, Vows More</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Housing Minister <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> inaugurated a new Jewish settlement in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> on Tuesday and vowed others will be built there despite the 7-month-old Palestinian uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation. `` We hear the voices -LRB- of the uprising -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>, a leader of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, told <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television. `` But we are the ones who make the facts, and those are: Another settlement, another highway, another house, another family.'' These developments also occurred: In <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s largest city, army bullets hit two Palestinians in the legs during a demonstration protesting the death of 17-year-old <PERSON> Sares </PERSON> <PERSON> Anabtawi </PERSON>, who was killed by army gunfire Monday. At a courthouse in Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, officials said about 30 Palestinians attacked police officers taking a handcuffed <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> detainee to his cell. The officials said six officers were injured and four people arrested. Palestinian witnesses said armed Jewish settlers beat four Arabs and smashed the windows of two vehicles in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Ein </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arik </LOCATION>, apparently in retaliation for the stoning of an Israeli bus. The new Jewish settlement of <LOCATION> Shima </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, is designed to house 250 families. The first 15 families were to arrive Wednesday and live in mobile homes until permanent housing is built. It is the first settlement to be established since the uprising began in December in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. According to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> figures, 220 Palestinians and four Israelis have been killed in the insurrection in the territories captured by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in the 1967 Middle East War. <PERSON> Shima </PERSON> will be the sixth <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> settlement to be built since 1984. Under a coalition agreement reached in 1984 between <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> and the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which opposes a large-scale settlement program, the number of new settlements was limited to six. But the more than 100 existing settlements have been expanded since 1984 at an overall rate of 1,500 housing units a year. <PERSON> Yosef </PERSON> <PERSON> Margalit </PERSON>, a Housing Ministry official, said fewer Israelis are willing to move to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> because of the violence. About 300 Palestinians gathered in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>' marketplace to protest <PERSON> Anabtawi </PERSON>'s death and hurled stones at soldiers, who responded with gunfire and rubber bullets, according to witnesses. Officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ittihad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> said two demonstrators, aged 22 and 23, were shot in the legs, two others were injured by rubber bullets and two were treated for beating injuries. Army officials confirmed the shootings and said two soldiers were wounded by stones. The army later imposed a curfew on much of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> and two adjacent refugee camps, confining 126,000 Palestinians to their homes indefinitely. Police spokesman <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Lapidot </PERSON> said the attack in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> occurred as two policemen were taking a 25-year-old prisoner from the courthouse to his cell. He said about 30 Palestinians tried to free the prisoner and four other officers rushed to the scene to drive back the crowd. One policeman suffered a broken hand and the others had minor injuries, he said. `` Four of the attackers were finally subdued and arrested,'' <PERSON> Lapidot </PERSON> said. `` The others managed to escape.''

 Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> will help the Democratic ticket in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, but outside his home state he is virtually unknown to most voters and may have little effect on the presidential race, pollsters said Tuesday. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> has scored low in polls on potential running mates for Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. In a <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> survey last week, only 3 percent of Democratic primary voters picked <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> from seven choices. In an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> poll completed Monday, less than one-half of 1 percent named <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> as their choice as a running mate for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The telephone survey of 1,100 registered voters conducted July 6-11 had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. But <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' choice of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> likely was based on a more practical measure than name recognition, pollsters said. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> gives <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> a shot to win <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and its 29 electoral votes, third-largest of any state. `` It's a high-risk technique. You've got to beat <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in his home state,'' said <PERSON> Claibourne </PERSON> <PERSON> Darden </PERSON>, an Atlanta-based pollster. `` If <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> can do that, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will be whupped.'' A statewide poll in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> in mid-June had <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> trailing Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who maintains an apartment in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, by 23 points. But when <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was proposed as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' running mate, the Democrats trailed by just 5 points. Adding <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> `` makes <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> a competitive state,'' said <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Coker </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Mason-Dixon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opinion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, which did that poll. `` If there's a drawback, it's that <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> does n't guarantee <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. That makes it risky for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.'' Outside his state, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is unlikely either to help or hurt <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, barring any damaging disclosures, political pollsters said. In the absence of controversy about a running mate, they said, voters tend to focus on the top of the ticket. That was backed up by a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> poll by Mason-Dixon, conducted during the weekend, putting <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> 10 points ahead of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> as well as without him. Only with Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> as a running mate did <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> draw even with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> there, WPLG-TV in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> reported. Generally, other than in a running mate's home state, `` Everybody says the choice can hurt but not help,'' said <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, a pollster for the <ORGANIZATION> Roper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polls </ORGANIZATION>. `` Unless there's something really negative, I do n't think the vice presidential candidate matters in people's minds one way or the other.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> thus far barely is in the public's mind. In a national Gallup poll in mid-May, 77 percent of respondents said they had not heard enough about him to have an opinion of him. Of the rest, 15 percent rated him positively, 9 percent negatively. Similarly, in a Harris poll in early May, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> ranked fifth of eight choices for a vice presidential candidate, far behind leaders <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. In the Gallup poll, a gauge that took negative ratings into account put <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> on top. `` There are many other vice presidential possibilities that are more popular than <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugick </PERSON>, a Gallup pollster. `` Basically the guy just does not have much name recognition on a national scale.'' Still, pollsters noted, many other vice presidential candidates have been little-known _ Democrat <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> in 1984, Republican <PERSON> Spiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON> in 1968 and Republican <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> in 1964, for example _ and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> himself was unknown by 77 percent of the public as recently as November. Where he is known, in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was rated favorably by 55 percent of respondents to the Mason-Dixon poll last month, and unfavorably by 12 percent. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had the same favorable rating but much higher unfavorables, 33 percent. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was rated favorably by 39 percent, unfavorably by 29 percent. In his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> re-election contest, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> led Republican challenger Rep. <PERSON> Beau </PERSON> <PERSON> Boulter </PERSON> by 60-27; even if <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> runs for vice president and for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> at the same time, respondents said, they would favor him by 58-27. <PERSON> Coker </PERSON> noted that the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> numbers well may change, at least in part because many Texans may not have taken the suggestion of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> for vice president seriously. Such apparently was the case with pollsters themselves. <PERSON> Hugick </PERSON> noted that Gallup just completed a poll during the weekend that tested two possible <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> running mates _ <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. `` We picked the wrong Southerner,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Tuesday ordered the expulsion of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s ambassador and seven of his diplomatic colleagues in a `` return-the-favor reprisal'' for the ouster of eight American envoys to <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. At the same time, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> refused to rule out severing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> relations with the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government, saying it `` remains an option.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the expulsion order would affect Nicaraguan Ambassador <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Tunnermann </PERSON> and seven other diplomats. But <PERSON> Tunnermann </PERSON> also is <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s ambassador to the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and questions were raised as to whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, as host country, can legally expel <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> envoys. At one point, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> indicated that <PERSON> Tunnermann </PERSON> would be allowed to remain in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> when he said the envoy simply `` wo n't be ambassador'' to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said the administration has every intention of revoking <PERSON> Tunnermann </PERSON>'s visas and expelling him. `` He can scream all the way to the airport,'' said one official, insisting on anonymity. <PERSON> Tunnermann </PERSON> went to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for consultations late Tuesday afternoon. Afterward, <PERSON> Tunnermann </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has no right to expel a diplomat assigned to the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> and said it was the first case in <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> history in which a diplomat accredited to that body has been ordered out of the country. But he stopped short of saying he would fight the expulsion order, saying that he had to consult first with his government. <PERSON> Tunnermann </PERSON> said that Under Secretary of State <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> had told him he had engaged in activities as <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> ambassador which violate diplomatic norms. When <PERSON> Tunnermann </PERSON> demanded that <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> present proof, he quoted <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> as saying, `` Well, some day.'' Later, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> deputy spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Tunnermann </PERSON> had engaged in an abuse of his `` privileges of residence'' of residence in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. She said that Major <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Sampson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendoza </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s military attache who also was on the list of those expelled, was guilty of the same offense. Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> declined to specify what abuses <LOCATION> Tunnermann </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Sampson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendoza </PERSON> had committed. When reminded by reporters that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had described the expulsions as retaliation, she said the diplomats were being ordered out both as a retaliatory measure and for the alleged abuses. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., said that in a meeting that he and other congressmen had with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, national security adviser <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> Ambassador <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> recommended against cutting off relations. The latest flare-up in mostly icy relations that have existed since the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> overthrew dictator <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> in 1979 prompted <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> to brand <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>'s expulsion order and political crackdown as `` black eyes for the peace process. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, traveling in the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, called <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s ouster of <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> and the other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats action an `` absolute outrage.'' And the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> listed a series of actions, capped by Monday's closing of <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catolica </ORGANIZATION>, that it said are `` directed against the political opposition, labor and press in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' The expulsions came amid growing indications of a softening of opposition in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to a renewal of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to the Contra rebels seeking to topple the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, asked whether he was putting off a new move to get <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to approve military aid for the Contras, replied, `` We're not waiting We're working on that.'' `` Maybe, now, some of the congressional apologists will get on board now and support the Contras,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. House Majority Leader <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., an opponent of Contra aid, said, `` It's going to have a damaging effect on the opinion of the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>' performance in the peace process in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` I would n't say now that the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is going to vote military aid, but it certainly strengthens the hand of the administration if it seeks to get military aid for the Contras,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Morning'' program. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> said he could not understand `` those who have been supporting -LRB- Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, or at least tipping the scales in their favor whenever they can.'' `` In my judgment, it weakens their position. It strengthens ours, and we ought to call them to task for it,'' he said. Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, D-Conn., a Contra aid opponent, said that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration decision to expel the Nicaraguan diplomats `` just fans this problem and expands it. `` The administration sees this situation as its best opportunity in months to get back the military aid for the resistance in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> said he was `` not surprised'' at <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>'s decision to expel the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats given the long hostility between the two governments, but he termed the Sandinista government's closing of <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> radio station `` a major setback.'' `` I think it is a violation of the commitments they have made,'' said <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Relations subcommittee on <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` ... I think it's a victory for extreme voices in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> rejected a $ 36.2 million package, which included a proposed $ 3.5 million for a military escrow account, in February. In late March, it approved a $ 48 million bill providing only humanitarian aid through Sept. 30, and only $ 17 million of that was earmarked for the Contras. Supporters of aid to the Contras in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> have said they will seek an amendment to the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> appropriations bill as early as this week to renew military aid. Nicaraguan Foreign Minister <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Escoto </PERSON> said Monday that <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> and seven <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> aides were ordered to leave the country within 72 hours because they were engaged in `` activities complementary to the state terrorism the administration of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is carrying out against <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' The Nicaraguans said embassy officials were at an opposition demonstration in <LOCATION> Nandaime </LOCATION>, about 40 miles from <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, on Sunday. But a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> statement said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` rejects the Sandinista pretext for these expulsions.'' `` The ambassador and the embassy maintain contact with as wide a spectrum of Nicaraguan citizens as possible, including labor groups, the press and the internal political opposition,'' it said. `` These activities are the normal duties of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials overseas.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> disclosed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retaliatory order during an Oval Office picture-taking session with <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Saad </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Abudllah </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sabah </PERSON>, the crown prince and prime minister of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. `` I have told the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to send their ambassador and seven comrades back to <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>,'' he said.

 Rep. <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Studds </PERSON>, D-Mass., Tuesday called a dispute over the current expansion plan for the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION> a `` tempest in a salt marsh'' and ordered further examination of the proposal <PERSON> Studds </PERSON>' comments came at a hearing of the Subcommittee on Fisheries and Wildlife Conservation and the Environment which examined a proposal to double the size of the refuge. The 21,662 acre tract of land and water was set aside by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> 16 years ago to protect remnant tidal wetlands and their indigenous species at the south end of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Last December President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed into law, legislation authorizing additional appropriations to complete acquisition of the original bondaries of the refuge. But administration officials Tuesday opposed the purchase of 20,850 acres of `` seasonal wetlands'' and `` salt ponds.'' The administration `` does not believe additional land purchases are warranted at this time,'' especially in light of the $ 13.1 million already spent on land acquisition, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON>, vice president and land manager of <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Salt </PERSON>, which owns 85 percent of the land slated for purchase, argued that landowners were not told of the proposed annexation until they saw their property on a map. Although the legislation states that additions to the refuge may only be acquired from willing sellers, <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON> said this type of notice was `` tantamount to having a federal lein on the property.'' But Mayor <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fremont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> supported the legislation saying the so-called `` condemnation'' clause which outlines how the land purchases must be made solves many of the problems cited by opponents. However <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> noted that the expansion plans would absorb almost half of his city's land, including a section earmarked for industrial development by city planners. `` <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>'s residential development is virtually in place. We need additional industrial development to complement it,'' he said. `` One section -LRB- scheduled for purchased -RRB- is 44 percent of my city. `` Anytime the federal government draws a line on a map and says this is what we designate as a refuge,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> added, `` that land becomes holy ground and it becomes impossible to develop it for any other prupose in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area.'' `` I think he's wrong,'' <PERSON> Morrision </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. `` I just have failed in convincing him, and I do n't know why. If he keeps rigid control over how the land is used he wo n't have any trouble. `` Like the chairman said, it's just a tempest in a salt marsh,'' <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> said.

 Authorities said Tuesday the terrorists who attacked a Greek cruise ship may have been pro-Iranian Arabs trying to hijack it, and released photographs of three men and a woman allegedly involved. The terrorists, who apparently boarded as passengers, fired automatic weapons and hurled grenades Monday on the City of <LOCATION> Poros </LOCATION>, which was taking 471 foreign tourists on a one-day cruise through the Greek islands. City coroner <PERSON> Manolis </PERSON> <PERSON> Nonas </PERSON> reported 10 people dead and harbor officials said another body had been found, but the <ORGANIZATION> Merchant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> put the toll at nine dead and 98 injured. There was no explanation for the discrepancies in the death count. Several survivors and a harbor official said Tuesday the attackers joined fleeing passengers in jumping from the ship and were picked up with them by vessels that rushed to aid the City of <LOCATION> Poros </LOCATION>. Two French survivors, not identified, appeared on state television and one said: `` We saw them jumping out of the ship, and a number of other passengers said they saw the terrorists aboard the rescue boats going to <LOCATION> Piraeus </LOCATION>.'' Police had said Monday night the terrorists escaped on a waiting speedboat. Police officials would not comment about the reports Tuesday. Officials also made conflicting statements about the number of people involved in the attack, for which no group has claimed responsibility. A senior officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Piraeus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harbor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> said the attack might be linked to the trial in <LOCATION> Piraeus </LOCATION>, scheduled for this week, of <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON>, a Palestinian wanted by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the 1982 bombing of a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jet over <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. The officer spoke on condition of anonymity. `` We theorize they were going to seize the ship together with the people who died in the car explosion, maybe to force the freeing of the Palestinian on trial'' the officer said. <PERSON> Anastasios </PERSON> <PERSON> Sehiotis </PERSON>, minister of public order, released the photos and told reporters: `` These pictures are being circulated to all airports, harbors and border entry points. These people were involved with yesterday's attack.'' <PERSON> Sehiotis </PERSON> also indicated an explosion earlier Monday that killed two men in a car was linked to the ship attack. The car blew up near the Trocadero Marina, home dock of the City of <LOCATION> Poros </LOCATION>, and the ship was attacked about six hours later, at 8:40 p.m. The minister would give no further information except for the names of `` two Lebanese men being sought as involved in this attack.'' He identified them as <PERSON> Hamoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamid </PERSON>, 36, who rented the car, and <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zozad </PERSON>, 21, thought to be one of the men on the ship. <PERSON> Sehiotis </PERSON> said both had been in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> since May. The two other men were not identified and it was not clear whether they were on the ship. The woman in the photo was not identified, but the picture appeared to have been taken aboard the vessel. Survivors said they saw three attackers, one masked with a stocking, fire at people on the ship and hurl several hand grenades. The explosions started a fire that brought the sun deck crashing down on passengers in the lounge below. But the <ORGANIZATION> Piraeus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harbor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> officer said he believed the attack was carried out by two men and two women who boarded the cruise ship when it called at the island of <LOCATION> Aegina </LOCATION>. He said survivors identified <PERSON> Zozad </PERSON> in one of the photographs and recognized the young woman in the other photograph released by the ministry. `` One woman, we think, had a Moroccan passport and the other a French passport. We think they found out about the car explosion and decided to shoot up the ship,'' the officer said. In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, a woman was quoted as saying she was the mother of the French woman identified in one photograph. The woman, who identified herself only as Mrs. <PERSON> Bismuth </PERSON>, called the Agence France-Presse news agency and said she saw the picture on the Tuesday evening news. She was quoted as saying her daughter, <PERSON> Isabelle </PERSON>, 21, was a secretary vacationing in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and not a terrorist. Mrs. <PERSON> Bismuth </PERSON> said she has n't heard from her daughter since the attack, the agency reported. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Merchant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said 23 people remained hospitalized Tuesday. Seven Americans were on the cruise, but none was among the injured, the spokesman said. Greek state-run TV said an American identified as <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> was killed, but the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said they were unaware of any such person. Palestinian terrorists hijacked the Italian cruise ship <PERSON> Achille </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> during a <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> cruise in October 1985 and killed a 69-year-old American passenger, <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Klinghoffer </PERSON>. Italian courts convicted seven Palestinians. <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON>, 34, was scheduled for trial Wednesday on charges of entering the country with a forged passport, but prison officials said it would be postponed because of a nationwide work slowdown by prison guards. The government says it is considering a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> extradition request for Rashid. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON> put a bomb on a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> plane that exploded on a Tokyo-Honolulu flight in April 1982, killing a Japanese teen-ager and wounding 15 people. He was arrested at the <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> airport June 1. Police said the car that exploded contained automatic weapons, hand grenades and ammunition and a large amount of explosives. A police spokesman, speaking privately, said an Iranian magazine also was found in the wreckage. He said a Beretta automatic pistol and fragments of Soviet-made hand grenades found on the City of <LOCATION> Poros </LOCATION> `` were identical with weapons recovered from the car wreckage.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Merchant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said only two of the bodies had been identified _ <PERSON> Antonis </PERSON> <PERSON> Demaizis </PERSON>, 45, the ship's first mate, and <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Johan </PERSON> <PERSON> Grabas </PERSON>, a 33-year-old Danish tourist. The ship carried 22 crew members.

 A Soviet soldier who deserted in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> five years ago, went to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and was jailed when he returned to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, has been freed, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday. The state-run news agency said <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> was released from a labor camp under an amnesty announced on July 4 for soldiers who turned against their country during the Soviet army's 8 -LCB- - year intervention in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> In a January 1985 dispatch, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said that after <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> deserted, he was drugged, nearly starved and visited by lovers of both sexes with <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> links in an attempt to get him to make anti-Soviet statements. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said at that time that <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> left a military construction unit in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in June 1983, was brought to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> by rebels and given three choices: slander the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>; be executed, or be sent to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> where, as a deserter he was told, no mercy would be shown.

In December 1984, he went to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Embassy </LOCATION> and asked to go home. His request was granted. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> did not say then what became of <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON>, but on Tuesday it quoted a report in the weekly newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Literaturnaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION> that he was in a labor camp. <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> told the newspaper `` he felt much easier in a -LRB- labor -RRB- colony than in alien <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, that he felt calm,'' according to <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>.

 A group of local <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> leaders appealed to <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday to destroy the film `` The Last Temptation of Christ,'' saying it portrays <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> as a `` mentally deranged and lust-driven man.'' `` It is the most serious misuse of film craft in the history of filmmaking,'' the Rev. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogilvie </PERSON>, senior pastor of the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presbyterian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hollywood </ORGANIZATION>, said at a news conference attended by four other prominent area Christians. Members of the group acknowledged they have not seen the movie, but said they believed the film contains a dream sequence in which Christ comes off his cross and has sex with <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Magdalene </PERSON>. Universal reaffirmed it would release the film this fall. It said the Christians were advocating censorship and were criticizing a film after declining an invitation to see it. `` Consequently, much of what they are saying is inaccurate and exaggerated,'' said a statement released by co-distributors <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Cineplex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Odeon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Films </ORGANIZATION>. The studio has billed `` The Last Temptation of Christ'' as a look at the human side of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>. The movie is directed by <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scorsese </PERSON>, who once studied for the priesthood, and stars <PERSON> Willem </PERSON> <PERSON> Dafoe </PERSON> as <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Hershey </PERSON> as <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Magdalene </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Keitel </PERSON> as <PERSON> Judas </PERSON> <PERSON> Iscariot </PERSON>. Scheduled for release to a few theaters on Sept. 23, the movie is based on Greek author <PERSON> Nikos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kazantzakis </PERSON>' 1955 book `` The Last Temptation of Christ,'' which was condemned as heretical by the <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. Universal held a private screening of the movie in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Tuesday. The Rev. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Pomeroy </PERSON>, director of media resources for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION> attended the screening. He said, `` It was a fascinating film. It will certainly continue to engender the kind of controversy it's already doing.'' The movie, like <PERSON> Kazantzakis </PERSON>' book, shows <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> tempted not to die on the cross, <PERSON> Pomeroy </PERSON> said. `` The point that is being missed by the critics is that he rejects that temptation to live out his life span and die as a man,'' he said. `` What needs to be noted is this is a movie of a novel not a movie of the gospel story.'' `` I have n't actually had a good night's sleep in several weeks. I wake up in the middle of the night and wonder, ` How could someone do this to the most wonderful person who walked the face of the Earth?''' Dr. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bright </PERSON>, founder and president of San Bernardino-based Campus Crusade for Christ, said at the news conference. The group asked Universal to cancel the release of the film and destroy all copies of it, and urged Christians and non-Christians alike to write or call <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, Universal's parent company. They said they were basing their protest on two versions of the script they had seen and reports by an unidentified person inside Universal Pictures who had seen the film. `` The content of both the script and the film portrayed <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> as a mentally deranged and lust-driven man ... who in a dream sequence, comes down off the cross and has a sexual relationship with <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Magdalene </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Poland </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Mastermedia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Highland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> consulting firm. The Rev. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayford </PERSON>, pastor of the Church On The Way in <LOCATION> Van </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nuys </LOCATION>, joined <PERSON> Ogilvie </PERSON> in denying their appeal amounted to censorship. He said Universal was altering factual biblical history in the film. <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> had hired a born-again Christian marketing consultant, <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Penland </PERSON>, who advised on the films `` Chariots of Fire'' and `` The Mission,'' to help ward off controversy. <PERSON> Penland </PERSON> resigned in June. He said Tuesday he could n't finish reading the script, which he called biblically inaccurate. The group said Universal had promised to show a rough cut of the movie in June but canceled it. The group members said they declined to attend Tuesday's screening because it was too close to the release date to force any changes in the movie. Universal said in its statement Tuesday that <PERSON> Scorsese </PERSON> `` deeply believes that this film is a religious affirmation of faith.'' <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Billings </PERSON>, a publicist for the director of `` Taxi Driver'' and `` Raging Bull,'' did not return phone calls Tuesday. On Monday, the group placed a full-page advertisement in the Hollywood Reporter, an entertainment newspaper, urging Universal not to release the film. The ad was signed by 61 Christians in the entertainment industry. Also Monday, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> called for a <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> boycott of any product connected with Universal or <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION>, an entertainment conglomerate that includes movie and television production, amusement tours of its studios as well as <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> and book and licensing divisions.

An autopsy revealed that <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, who was a diabetic, died May 12, 1979, at age 39. His brown and shriveled corpse was discovered in the family home where Mrs. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, 42, had kept it bathed and clothed. Mrs. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, a registered nurse, had tended the corpse with the help of her two children and a house guest, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunce </PERSON>. Authorities said the family's beliefs in a holistic health cult led them to believe they could communicate with <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> through the body and that he would return to life.

 Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told blacks Tuesday his presidency would mark `` a new day'' after the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, promising, `` I will be personally involved in protecting the civil rights of all Americans.'' Appearing before the 79th convention of the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>, the vice president promised, `` You will be heard, I promise you that. You're going to be called on You're going to be partners in my presidency.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, sure to be the Republican presidential nominee, also paid tribute to <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, the runner-up in the Democratic presidential primaries. While saying he had profound policy differences with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I salute him for running the race, for being heard, and he deserves a salute from us.'' The audience of several thousand people applauded loudly, and generally gave <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a warm response. In his speech, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made no mention of the selection of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> as the running mate of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the presumed Democratic presidential nominee. Later, when reporters asked for comment, he replied: `` That's interesting, that's what I think about it.'' The vice president's remark came as he traveled aboard <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Two to <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> for the Major League All-Star Game Tuesday night. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> threw out the first pitch of the game. He took off his jacket and dramatically threw it down near the mound, then wound up and made his pitch _ almost over the head of <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, catcher for the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mets </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was to address the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday, the day after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did. Republicans traditionally have not had much luck in attracting black voters. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has been criticized repeatedly by blacks, particularly for its record on civil rights and aid to the poor. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, however, has a relationship with many black leaders. In introducing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> executive director <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooks </PERSON> praised the vice president's `` long and distinguished record of public service'' and called him a man `` of honor and integrity.'' Using a baseball analogy, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the NACCP that as a candidate for president, `` I'm not just in the on-deck circle any more, I'm at the plate. And let me just say, it is a new day.'' He promised that, `` I will have a positive civil rights agenda. I guarantee you I will be personally involved in protecting the civil rights of all Americans. This effort will be at the top of the agenda of my attorney general, and he or she will be directly accountable to me for results.'' The audience respounded with applause and cheers. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he did not intend to concede the vote of any American, but acknowledged it's tough for Republicans to win over blacks. `` I need your help. I know I'll get your constructive criticism,'' he said, amid chuckles from the audience. `` That's all right. You will be heard, I promise you that,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said his commitment to include blacks was was not dependent on his receiving a certain percentage of the black vote. `` I'm a realist. You all are realists,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I'm going to do better than people think in that regard.'' He promised that `` I will have minority men and women of excellence as full-scale partners in my administration.'' He said black leaders like Hooks `` will always be welcome at my house, even when my house is your house _ the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> credited the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration with `` building a record of economic success'' and said that a third of all black families now earn more than $ 25,000 a year. `` But there's much more left to be done,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He said the government can be involved in dealing with problems such as pregnancy among unwed black teen-age girls and the high rate of black school dropouts. However, he added, `` The answer also lies in the values that are passed on from generation to generation _ values like family, faith, education, the importance of work.'' `` We must teach kids the difference between right and wrong. We must teach them how to say no to drugs and no to teen-age pregnancy. We must stop the cycle of babies having babies. And we must emphasize the importance of family and work and education.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promised that his first budget would seek a dramatic increase in funding for the Head Start program.

<HEAD>Iran Says Attack on Cruise Ship Carried Out by CIA</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Greece-Ship Attack, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said Tuesday the terrorist attack on a Greek cruise ship in the <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> may have been carried out by the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> to `` whitewash'' the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> downing of an Iranian airliner last week. An Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> statement, broadcast by <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` is confronted with a major difficulty in the face of world public opinion and political and international circles'' after its <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> shot down the <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> A300 <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> on July 3, killing all 290 people aboard. `` In view of the nature of imperialism and its inhuman attitude, it can be predicted that the American espionage network, the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, and its agents may commit such unpleasant incidents in various parts of the world in order to whitewash the disaster of the attack on the Iranian passenger airliner,'' the statement said. Eleven people were killed and 98 wounded when three terrorists opened fire with automatic weapons and hurled grenades aboard the Greek cruise ship, City of <LOCATION> Poros </LOCATION>. Greek authorities on Tuesday speculated the ship attack may have been carried out by pro-Iranian Arab terrorists. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Habibullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Biazar </PERSON>, denied the speculation as `` a pack of lies.'' He spoke in an interview in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, quoted him as saying: `` We categorically condemn such acts of terrorism against innocent people which damage the interests of a friendly and peace-loving country like <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>.'' He denied that an Iranian magazine was found near the site of a car bomb explosion Monday, six hours before the attack on the ship. Two people were killed in the blast near <LOCATION> Trocadero </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marina </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>. He claimed the magazine was `` an Arabic one.''

<TEXT>
 A South African official on Tuesday reported rapid progress in meetings with Angolan, <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials on a withdrawal of Cuban troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and ending South African rule over neighboring <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. As he boarded a ferry Tuesday morning for a second day of private talks on Governors Island in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s harbor, <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Heerden </PERSON>, the head of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> delegation, was asked about the progress of the meetings. He replied they had developed `` further than <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>,'' the sites of the previous four-party discussions. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has said it would accept a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolution calling <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s independence under black majority rule once the estimated 50,000 Cuban troops pull out. Cuban troops are fighting alongside Angolan government forces against U.S.-backed anti-communist rebels. The head of the Angolan delegation, Gen. <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> <PERSON> Franca </PERSON>, said of Monday's talks: `` It went well.'' He made the brief comment while returning to his hotel. A news conference is expected Wednesday, according to officials involved in the talks. The four parties first met in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in early May and then reconvened late last month in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. South African and Angolan officials held a separate meeting in May in <LOCATION> Brazzaville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION>. The timetable for the withdrawal of the Cubans is probably the most difficult unresolved issue, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goal is a full Cuban troop withdrawal in one year, the same time span that the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolution sets for granting independence to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, also called <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> have insisted that the Cuban withdrawal should take place over four years, but the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials believe that is an opening bargaining position that is subject to change as peace talks proceed. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> has been convulsed by civil war since it gained independence from <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> in 1975. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has repeatedly sent troops across the border from <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> to support the rebel forces known as <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>, or National Union for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, in their clashes with Cuban and Angolan forces.

<HEAD>Grosz Appeals For Public Support of Stringent Economic Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and government leader, <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>, appealed on Tuesday for public support of a stringent economic program and harshly criticized the work of his government over the past year. `` What lies ahead are sacrifices for the sake of the future,'' <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said on an evening televisoin interview. He said it could take 10 to 15 years for his program to show results. It was the first time a Hungarian government chief has evaluated his first year in office. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said he was `` very dissatisfied'' with the achievements of the last 12 months despite the efforts to implement a program of austerity measures and economic restructuring introduced last year. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said the government, economic experts and individual citizens `` have not been working efficiently enough.'' The 20-minute interview was conducted on the eve of a meeting of the party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that is to discuss two alternative economic programs. One would push through radical reforms towards a more market-oriented economy. This, however, could lead to 80,000 to 100,000 unemployed and result in greater social tensions. The second would introduce changes more gradually. The party newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Nepszabadsag </ORGANIZATION> published details of the proposals on Saturday, the first time the agenda of a <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting was published in advance in such detail. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said economic restructuring would mean hard times for Hungarians, as it aims to stop the growth of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s foreign debt, now totaling $ 18 billion, by 1990. The government this year introduced <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s first value-added and personal income tax as part of its austerity program. A value-added tax is a form of indirect sales tax. `` Parliament and the people are increasingly impatient, and there is increasing social pressure on the government to do better,'' <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said. He appealed to Hungarians to `` understand the need'' for the program which will include curbs on imports, cuts in subsidies to loss-making firms and bankruptcy proceedings for those companies which continue to lose money. Unemployment already is to affect about 50,000 people this year. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> said the leadership planned to push ahead with its program `` and is ready to face any tensions that might be involved.'' He said steps will be taken that `` will strike hard at some sections of society,'' but that he could `` not afford to be indulgent.'' He said more attention should be devoted to industries with a future, such as telecommunications and tourism.

 Caesars Hotel Casino agreed Tuesday to donate $ 100,000 to two state hospitals as a precedent-setting settlement in a case involving civil charges that the gaming hall allowed a teen-age girl to gamble. Caesars will donate $ 50,000 each to the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Edison </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Marlboro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Marlboro </LOCATION>, both of which have facilities to treat compulsive gambling. The settlement involved a complaint that the gaming hall treated a 16-year-old girl as a high roller, offering her complimentary drinks, a hotel room, meals and show tickets. Debra <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, now 18, pleaded guilty in January to underage gambling and agreed to attend Gamblers Anonymous meetings as part of a one-year probationary sentence. State Administrative Law Judge <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> accepted the settlement on Tuesday, calling it `` novel and creative.'' <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parrillo </PERSON>, director of the state Division of Gaming Enforcement, said he was satisfied with the outcome of the complaint, which also was filed against Caesars and four other casinos. <PERSON> Elsinore </PERSON>'s Atlantis, Resorts International, <PERSON> Harrah </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Marina </PERSON> and Trump Plaza casino hotels are expected to settle their complaints by the end of this week, he said The $ 100,000 settlement is the largest that a casino has ever paid in an underage gambling offense. Prior to Tuesday's agreement, casinos paid an average of $ 2,000 per incident, <PERSON> Parrillo </PERSON> said. Before the complaints were filed, <PERSON> Parrillo </PERSON> said, `` The problem of juvenile gambling in this state went largely unnoticed, much less treated and remedied.'' `` Not only did the DGE complaint serve to elevate the industry's consciousness of this serious problem,'' he said, `` but the settlement we have struck today hopes to achieve some social good by dedicating substantial monies to mental health facilities in this state where compulsive gambling and other disorders may be treated. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Levenson </PERSON>, an attorney for Caesars, said the casino acknowledged that in Miss <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>'s case, `` our security force broke down ... which we have since tightened up.'' <PERSON> Levenson </PERSON> said he was hired to attend municipal court hearings to push for stiff penalties against underage gamblers who slip past the casino's security guards. `` We want to send a message out to other young people,'' <PERSON> Levenson </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Opals Traded Like Money In Big Gulf Coast Deals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A growing number of investors are using opals like money on <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, bartering the semiprecious stones for <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION> automobiles and real estate sometimes worth millions of dollars. The opals have been used to satisfy all or part of the selling price in these deals, and the sellers then use the opals in other transactions, The <ORGANIZATION> Sarasota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald-Tribune </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday. Some experts cautioned that it can be difficult, if not impossible, to cash in on the appraised value of the semiprecious stones, especially in large quantities. The exchange system has not yet resulted in large liquidations of opals for cash, jewelers said. The opals `` take on the character of currency,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Daunt </PERSON>, a master gemologist and owner of <ORGANIZATION> Gemstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Manning </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Manning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said buyers may be surprised when they try to resell their stones. Top grade opals have a worldwide market, but stones sold in large quantities seldom achieve their retail value, <PERSON> Manning </PERSON> said. `` Very often, in my experience, the values are incredibly overstated ... there is no secondary market for these stones,'' he said. `` There is no place to convert them to cash,'' agreed <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Heilsberg </PERSON>, a real estate agent who has been involved in transactions involving opals. But he added, `` If the stones can be turned over in another deal, who cares what they're all worth in cash?'' When <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Byars </PERSON> sold his troubled Tiki Gardens tourist attraction in the <LOCATION> Pinellas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shores </LOCATION>, he accepted $ 1 million in opals as part of the reported $ 3 million package. <PERSON> Byars </PERSON> is reluctant to discuss the sale. Asked if he thought he got a fair deal, he said, `` No, I ca n't sell them -LRB- the opals -RRB-.'' One local gemologist cited another deal, with an unnamed purveyor of opals, in which a lawyer agreed to sell a <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION> for the semiprecious stones. Two Australians, <PERSON> Neville </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Darrell </PERSON> <PERSON> Roder </PERSON>, have contracted to buy several millions of dollars worth of property in <LOCATION> Manatee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION> counties using cash and opals as payment, according to their trustee, <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaensch </PERSON>. In one deal, <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION> real estate investor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> sold them a shopping center and an office building in <LOCATION> Bradenton </LOCATION> for millions in cash and opals. <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roder </PERSON> purchased the office building for $ 660,000 _ half in cash, half in opals, according to <LOCATION> Heilsberg </LOCATION>, an agent with <ORGANIZATION> VPN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realty </ORGANIZATION> who handled the transaction. He said the Australians are trading black opals, which they obtain from a mine they own in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Post </PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Janet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewelry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Antiques in <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION>, said she has appraised the Australians' opals `` dozens and dozens of times.'' Post has provided what she called `` retail replacement'' appraisals to her clients, who pay her $ 50 an hour. That appraisal judges what a stone would be worth if it were bought at a retail jewelry store, set in jewelry. These types of appraisals are most commonly used to value a stone for insurance purposes. `` An average per carat -LRB- price -RRB- for a fine stone has been from $ 250 to $ 1,500 per carat,'' Post said. She said she has never provided or been asked to provide `` a fair market value'' for the opals, or what they would be worth if turned into cash.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said Tuesday he was `` too controlled ... too mature'' to be angry about being passed over for the No. 2 spot on the Democratic ticket. But in an emotional speech to the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday night, hours after Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> was tapped as <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' running mate, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> shouted out a message of pride and defiance `` I will never surrender!'' he said as the crowd cheered and surged to its feet. `` One thing I know, I may not be on the ticket, but I'm qualified! That's what I know! Qualified!'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was to address the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> convention on Wednesday. Earlier Tuesday, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who learned from reporters about <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' choice of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, refrained from rendering any explicit judgment on the selection of the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator for the spot <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> himself coveted. `` Since I have had no opportunity for in-depth discussion with Senator <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and have had no prior discussion with Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> about his recommendation, it would be inappropriate for me to comment upon it,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told a crowded news conference. Asked if he was angry, the civil rights leader said, `` No, I'm too controlled, I'm too clear, I'm too mature to be angry I'm focused on what we must do to keep hope alive Anger reflects a crisis in emotions and therefore irrational behavior. I've simply been in this struggle long enough to keep my eyes on the prize.'' But the disappointment was palpable for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who 24 hours earlier had sat for a two-hour interview with <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign chairman who led the search for a vice president. Although <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had specifically told <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> where he was staying in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> Monday night and what time he was leaving to return to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did not reach <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> by telephone until an hour after reporters informed <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as he landed in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Even as <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was leaving the airport, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was there preparing to board a private plane for the flight to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and the announcement with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> did not meet. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> attributed the selection to a strategy decision by the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign and said, `` My obligation is not to react to his strategy, but to affirm my own. It is to keep hope alive, to keep focus in our campaign, to keep our delegates and supporters disciplined, detailed and full of hope.'' Asked if he would encourage his supporters to enthusiastically back the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, `` We can only address that after the nomination is over on Wednesday night.'' `` I no doubt will support the ticket that the convention elects next week. But that will be the appropriate time,'' he said, adding that in the meantime he awaits further discussions on minority planks, his role in the party and `` our strategies to win after the nomination.'' Asked if black voters might stay home in November, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, `` This is no time for us to proceed based upon threats. It is a time to proceed based upon a shared commitment to expand participation in the process.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had indicated he would discuss his choice of a running mate with him beforehand, but apparently changed his mind. `` But I would n't be unduly concerned about the various strategic moves and @ or mistakes another camp makes. We must keep our focus on what matters at the convention,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who predicted he would have 1,300 delegates, or nearly 30 percent of all delegates in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` For some people <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> may mean a ratification process, and even coronation. For for others <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> means a chance to express before the nation, their basic concerns about the rights of workers and women and children and our quest for peace,'' he said. `` The convention for us is a serious culmination of many years of very hard and serious work. ... Hopefully, when we leave there we will be a unified party, a stronger party and will move on to victory,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` If we have an exciting campaign in the summer, and these grapes of hope remain buoyant and excited, then their juice will be enough to stimulate us to victory in November. But if somehow, some misguided strategists crush grapes of hope in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> into raisins of despair, they will not be able to bounce back in the fall,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. He said his own presidential campaign was not like that of `` those who ran but surrendered. ... My campaign never surrendered. It continues to grow. It continues to expand. It's the heart and soul of our party.'' But other <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporters criticized <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s handling of the announcement. Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said, `` I assume that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' announcement was not made to make a special appeal to black folks ... It was very unprofessional.''

<HEAD>Defense Minister Rules Out Halt To Low-level Military Training
Flights</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Defense Minister <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Scholz </PERSON> ruled out a ban on low-level <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> training flights Tuesday, despite growing calls that such flights be drastically reduced or eliminated after recent accidents. `` Low-level flights are necessary to maintain military security and readiness,'' <PERSON> Scholz </PERSON> was quoted as saying in the illustrated magazine Quick. Citizens groups have charged that in addition to being dangerous, noise from low level-flights makes life in heavily affected areas unbearable. Last week, the parliament of Rhineland Palatinate state approved a non-binding resolution calling for an end to the flights. <PERSON> Scholz </PERSON> was quoted as saying he is looking for ways to sharply reduce the number of military training flights within <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. He said one alternative could be to require that pilots spend more time in flight simulators. Another solution could be to expand the flight areas `` outside the country.'' The Quick article did not elaborate. A military expert belonging to Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s governing <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was quoted as saying other options include asking <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> pilots to copy West German training methods of descending to a low altitude only just before the aircraft reaches its training target <PERSON> Willy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wimmer </PERSON> also was quoted as saying in an interview with the <LOCATION> Augusburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Allgemein </LOCATION> newspaper Tuesday that planners are considering allowing fighters to use now-restricted airspace along the border with <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wimmer </PERSON> said the restricted area, now 18 miles wide along the western side of the border, could be reduced. Last week, a West German <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> F-4 Phantom fighter jet crashed and exploded in a field. Two weeks ago, three <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> F-16s crashed in one day in two separate accidents. One pilot was killed when two jets collided in flight.

 A French woman said Tuesday her daughter is the young woman identified as a possible accomplice of terrorists who attacked a Greek cruise ship, but she denied her daughter was involved in any terrorism. The woman, identifying herself only as Mrs. <PERSON> Bismuth </PERSON>, called the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> news agency Agence France-Presse to say she was certain a photo she saw on the evening news showing a woman playing cards with a young man aboard the boat was her daughter. The picture was distributed by Greek authorities as that of a woman wanted for possible involvement in the assault. She said she had not heard from her daughter since the Monday attack. Three gunmen on the crowded ship tossed grenades and fired on passengers, killing 11 and injuring about 100. Mrs. <PERSON> Bismuth </PERSON> said her daughter, <PERSON> Isabelle </PERSON>, 21, was a secretary vacationing in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> since Saturday and not a terrorist. `` I saw the photos of terrorists and I identified my daughter as the young woman playing cards on the boat with a young man,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bismuth </PERSON> said.

 Former <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> was eulogized at his burial Tuesday as a loyal friend of the labor movement who was willing to face public scrutiny. <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>, who molded a large Teamsters local in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> and rose to the top job in the 1.6 million-member union, was buried the same day a federal judge had set for his trial on labor racketeering and embezzlement charges. <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>, 61, died Saturday night in <LOCATION> Lakewood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday a `` good chance'' exists of reaching agreement this fall on East German reparations to Holocaust survivors. But he expressed some reservations about the East German proposal during a visit to <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, and said payments must be on a `` no strings attached'' basis. He also called on Austrians to face up to their country's <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> past. <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON> is on a three-day visit to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> that includes a meeting with Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>. In 1952, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> agreed with the New York-based <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to compensate victims of the Nazi Holocaust. Since then officials in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> have paid out more than $ 48 billion to survivors and their families. The Communist East German government had argued that because <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> came into existence as a nation in 1949, it had no legal responsibility for the atrocities of <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s regime. More than 6 million Jews were killed during <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s Third Reich. Diplomatic sources at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, have said <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s refusal to pay reparations or accept legal responsibility for war crimes has been a major stumbling block in improving relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Then on June 8 the East German government announced it was willing to provide `` humanitarian aid'' to Jewish survivors. The amount being discussed is up to $ 100 million, according to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Jewish leaders. Details of the plan have not been made public. <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON> said of the plan Tuesday: `` We'll have to see what it's hooked up to ... It's not clear to me that it's as open-handed as it might be. I just want to make sure that there are no strings attached.'' Asked if he doubted the East Germans' good faith, <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON> replied: `` No.'' He confirmed he was invited to visit Communist East German leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> and said he assumed the trip would take place in the fall. Asked if he would conclude a reparations agreement with the East Germans in the autumn, <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON> said: `` There's a good chance.'' The head of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> praised <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for its efforts to face up to the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> past, saying: `` It's a pleasure to come to a country where you see what West German governments since -LRB- Chancellor <PERSON> Konrad </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Adenauer </PERSON> have done to discuss the Holocaust and teach children about it.'' He added, `` <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> sits there as if they never took part in it -LRB- the Holocaust -RRB- at all. It talks about itself as the first victim. That's all such nonsense and that has to be changed.'' About 36,500 Jews still live in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The striking <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> sued over a dozen leading producers Tuesday, claiming they are interfering illegally with guild efforts to sign contracts with independent producers. The guild's antitrust lawsuit, filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, named 19 defendants, including the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION>, the three television networks and several <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> studios, including <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>, Universal and <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. Guild attorneys said the defendants had `` refused to deal'' with some of the 151 independents that have signed interim contracts with the <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION>. The suit alleges that such conduct is anti-competitive. It seeks a court declaration that the defendants violated federal antitrust statutes and that they be ordered to halt such alleged activity. `` I think it is appropriate that we respond in this way,'' WGA West Executive Director <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> said at a news conference at guild headquarters. Alliance spokesman <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said the allegations in the suit `` have no merit. `` The action only diverts attention from the real issue, which is resolving the strike,'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said. Representatives of independent film companies have complained to the guild of pressure to reject interim agreements, union officials said. All three networks have vowed publicly to refuse programming produced by the independents during the strike, now in its 19th week. The strike already has forced the networks to delay the start of their fall programming season. The producers' behavior `` is sad and lacks compassion,'' guild president <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirgo </PERSON> said. `` That the alliance continues to refuse to compromise wreaks enough havoc. To conspire to prevent others from making a fair deal which would employee men and women in this industry is unconscionable.'' The producers alliance has said that its last contract offer, which the <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION> rejected by a 3-1 margin on June 22, is final. The two sides are divided over payments for reruns of one-hour shows domestically and all programs overseas. The strike has resulted in sweeping layoffs throughout the entertainment industry. A spokesman for a dissident group of scriptwriters called the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> reacted negatively to the lawsuit. `` We are tremendously distressed that -LRB- at this point -RRB- in the strike, recourse is being left to the courts. It seems to indicate a lack of urgency,'' he said. The coalition, which claims to include over 300 of the <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION>'s 9,000 members, believes talks between the union and the producers are stalled and plans to meet Thursday night in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION> to discuss writers' `` options,'' the spokesman said He declined to say what those options might be. `` There comes a point in time where working members can no longer take the losses,'' he said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> announced Tuesday that <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has approved a U.S.-requested extradition for a West German woman wanted in connection with a major 1984 drug trafficking case. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> official said it was the first time in 27 years that <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has permitted such an extradition. The official, said speaking on condition of anonymity. said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshals will arrive next week to escort <PERSON> Veronica </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiera-Wahl </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, where the case is pending in federal court. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said the government's decision to grant the request `` confirms its decision to cooperate in the sanctioning of all types of crimes of -LRB- an -RRB- international -LRB- nature -RRB- and, in this particular case, those that signify the fight against drug trafficking.'' <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pilliod </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> was recalled to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for consultations last month after <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> released Puerto Rican separatist <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> from jail and let him fly to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> as a terrorist bomber and the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> expressed `` outrage'' at his release. A ministry statement said <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> approved the Kiera-Wahl extradition on June 30. It said Ms. <PERSON> Kiera-Wahl </PERSON>, reportedly born in <LOCATION> Breslau </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, in 1942, took part in a shipment of approximately 13,000 pounds of cocaine from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> between March and September 1982. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> official said Ms. <PERSON> Kiera-Wahl </PERSON> is wanted in connection with a 1984 <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, cocaine case involving <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> bail bondsman, was sentenced to life in prison without parole and fined $ 425,000 after being convicted in October 1984 on charges stemming from what prosecutors at the time called the largest cocaine ring in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Prosecutors said the ring imported $ 3.8 billion worth of cocaine into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> during a 14-month period ending in 1984, using airplanes to fly in the drugs from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and from the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON> said he was working for the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and ran the drug operation as part of his duties. Also convicted were <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunleavy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Lombardi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Margate </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Garland </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Rockwood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dalton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Junker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Junker </PERSON>, both of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. The Mexican statement said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> asked for Ms. <PERSON> Kiera-Wahl </PERSON>'s extradition on Sept. 8, 1987. It said the first district federal judge in <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> state, <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Patino </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, on May 20 ruled against a petition by Ms. <PERSON> Kiera-Wahl </PERSON> that sought her exclusion from the provisions of the extradition treaty. Ms. <PERSON> Kiera-Wahl </PERSON> did not appeal the decision, the statement said. The embassy official said the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> advised that it had no objection to the extradition request for Ms. <PERSON> Kiera-Wahl </PERSON>. Mexican authorities took her into custody on the <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION> at the West German government's request, the embassy official said. About a dozen <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> extradition cases are pending with the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> government, the official said. In the <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> case, <PERSON> Morales </PERSON>, 37, got time off for good behavior and was released after serving five years of an eight-year sentence for his role in the murder of a Mexican policeman. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> decided the case was not covered by the U.S.-Mexican extradition treaty.

 Troops used tear gas and clubs Tuesday to disperse peasants delivering food to striking electrical workers. <PERSON> Marco </PERSON> <PERSON> Tulio </PERSON> <PERSON> Lima </PERSON>, president of the independent <ORGANIZATION> Confederation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associations </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters two people were beaten by soldiers and two were detained. The armed forces press office issued a statement saying the electrical workers and peasants provoked a confrontation by damaging vehicles and that air force troops were sent to the scene `` to insure order.'' It said two troopers were struck by demonstrators and one union member, identified as <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintanilla </PERSON>, was arrested. <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> and witnesses said about 100 members of the agricultural cooperatives went to a plant of the state-owned CEL electrical utility in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Soyapango </LOCATION> and delivered sacks of rice, beans and other foodstuffs to the electrical workers. They said a truck carrying about 30 soldiers arrived and the troopers fired tear gas at the peasants and then attacked with clubs. CEL repair workers have been reporting to work but refusing to carry out their duties. About 3,500 CEL repair and maintenance workers went on strike June 15 demanding salary increases and improved vacation and life-insurance benefits. They are asking for pay boosts averaging $ 60 a month, $ 4 per day for job-related travel expenses and $ 10,000 in personal life insurance. They said mines planted near utility towers by leftist guerrillas battling the U.S.-backed government make their jobs hazardous. <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> CEL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said on July 2 that five technicians have been killed and five disabled by exploding mines. CEL officials have refused to negotiate with the strikers, saying the association has no legal standing. The union was legally dissolved after a strike in 1980 that the company said was organized by leftists. Average salaries for the maintenance and repair workers range from $ 140 to $ 200 per month. On July 3, strike leaders sent emergency crews to repair damage from guerrilla sabotage that blacked out most of the country.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s decision to pay families of the 290 people killed in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> downing of an Iranian airliner is meeting resistance on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, where some lawmakers say the gesture is premature and politically touchy. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, revealed the plans on Monday, saying <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was motivated by humanitarian concerns and was acting out of charity rather than obligation.

 Bears, deer, skunks and other creatures that usually prefer to stay far from humans are being driven by the drought to unaccustomed boldness in their search for food and water. So far this year, 30 bears have been spotted from <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tahoe </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> compared with the normal three to five annually, and there has been a virtual invasion of skunks in residential areas, wildlife officials said Monday. `` Anything that's green looks good to them,'' said <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Marrugo </PERSON>, the state director of animal damage control. `` The best thing to do is not feed them because they'll come back for more.''

 Production of corn and other key crops is being cut severely by a nationwide drought that already ranks with the terrible burnouts of the 1930s and 1950s. While the winter wheat crop planted last fall stayed barely ahead of the drought, the later crops planted this spring have been brutalized by heat and dryness. Because it was planted last fall, winter wheat is one of the few crops for which specific per-acre production estimates are available. About 75 percent of the winter wheat has already been harvested, according to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>, and the drought loss nationally has n't been severe.

A resolution Monday expanding `` access to the selection process for ordination'' for all persons, including homosexuals _ but refusing to recognize a right to ordination for all _ fell one vote short of passage in the church's House of Deputies. The 900-member House of Deputies, divided between lay and clerical church members, and the 200-member House of Bishops establish policy for the 2.7 million-member church, whose 10-day convention ended Monday.

 The nation's drought-battered corn crop may produce 5.2 billion bushels this year, 29 percent less than expected a few months ago and 26 percent below last year's bumper harvest, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. Sharp reductions also are expected in 1988 wheat and soybean production, the department said. Until drought and extreme heat tightened their grip in May and June, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> had projected this year's corn harvest _ based on yield trends and an assumption of normal weather _ at 7.3 billion bushels, up from last year's output of 7.06 billion. Corn is the largest and most important <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain crop. As a livestock feed it is the major building block for beef, pork, poultry and dairy products. Along with wheat, soybeans and other commodities, corn also is vital as an export, desired by many countries wanting to upgrade their livestock programs. The new figures were based on updated projections that take the drought into account and reflect conditions as of Tuesday.

 With new players and an infusion of new money, viewers of Spanish-language television are getting a wider range of programming, much of it now labeled `` Made in the <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>.'' When Spanish-language stations began on UHF channels in the early 1960s, nearly all the programming was imported. In 1986, <ORGANIZATION> Hallmark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Venture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> purchased the importer of most of the programming, the Mexican-owned network SIN, and its 11 related stations, so far paying $ 585 million. The network, now called <ORGANIZATION> Univision </ORGANIZATION>, reaches 83 percent of the nation's Hispanics through 450 stations and cable channels. And since 1985, <ORGANIZATION> Reliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Telemundo </ORGANIZATION> network has spent more than $ 300 million to build a network in 16 markets reaching about 60 percent of the nation's 18 million-plus Hispanics. `` When you're <PERSON> David </PERSON> and the other guy is Goliath you try new things,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Telemundo </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON>. In early 1987 both networks beefed up <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> news programs, but continued to rely largely on Latin American-produced entertainment: soap operas, variety shows and sports. Now they're looking at more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> programs. <ORGANIZATION> Telemundo </ORGANIZATION> began co-producing its own news with <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> in May and plans to offer an MTV-produced Friday-night music video show from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> this summer, plus two daily game shows produced by <ORGANIZATION> Inter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> TelEspan </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Univision </ORGANIZATION> produces 14 percent of its shows in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, a ratio it plans to keep, said program chief <PERSON> Rosita </PERSON> <PERSON> Peru </PERSON>. Nevertheless, the network plans a women's magazine show from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> in September and a new music video show from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> this summer and will continue its monthly documentaries on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Hispanics. `` Our No. 1 program is ` <PERSON> Sabado </PERSON> <PERSON> Gigante </PERSON>,''' said Ms. <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, referring to a Miami-based Saturday night program mixing lively audience participation with games, music and product promotions. Recognizing the viewing potential of Anglos and bilingual Hispanics, both networks are experimenting with English. The film `` Camila,'' an Argentinian love story, airs with English subtitles on <ORGANIZATION> Univision </ORGANIZATION> in August. <ORGANIZATION> Telemundo </ORGANIZATION>'s rock show features videos and interviews in both languages. Both networks and their stations plan heavy coverage of the political conventions, featuring reports by network news staffs and local reporters. <ORGANIZATION> Univision </ORGANIZATION> is airing pre-convention specials and may broadcast up to 90 minutes of daily convention coverage, doubling late night newscasts to one hour. <ORGANIZATION> Telemundo </ORGANIZATION> plans up to an hour of convention news, a half-hour produced by its CNN-based network news staff and the rest produced by local news staffs at the convention for their stations. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Televisa </ORGANIZATION>, whose principals sold <ORGANIZATION> Univision </ORGANIZATION> to Hallmark earlier this year, are also taking a second look at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Hispanics. Some of <ORGANIZATION> Televisa </ORGANIZATION>'s owners kept a stake in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> television by continuing to operate <PERSON> Galavision </PERSON>, a Spanish-language cable service. This September Galavision switches from movies, soap opera and variety specials to a 24-hour news format. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> City-based newscasts will use some Mexican TV anchors and reporters, but will target <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Hispanics and have reporters in seven cities north of the border. `` Over the years the competitive nature of <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> television has changed dramatically. Now there's <ORGANIZATION> Univision </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Telemundo </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Galavision </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Starrett </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>. `` We wanted to come out with a format that would be dramatically different and unique to cable.'' The relatively low cost of producing in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> made imported entertainment a staple of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Spanish-language television. The recent moves are putting more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> productions on the air, but not without new costs. It's costing <ORGANIZATION> Telemundo </ORGANIZATION> $ 4 million to shoot 140 episodes of a new soap opera in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON>. `` The best Mexican novela -LRB- soap opera -RRB- would cost under $ 1 million. It's four times the cost,'' he said. The show will be syndicated for airing in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, but devaluation of the peso hurts potential returns on the investment. Still, more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producers are looking at the growing Hispanic audience. Inter TelEspan chief <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercer </PERSON> said, `` The time has come for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> Hispanic television audience to have the opportunity to view shows and participate in shows that have a particular relevancy to Hispanic Americans.'' The growth also offers advertisers more choices in reaching Hispanics. In 1987, marketers spent $ 490 million to reach <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Hispanics, up 23 percent from 1986, Hispanic Business magazine reports. About $ 220 million went into Spanish television, a 56 percent jump from 1986.

In 1945, French Marshal <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Petain </PERSON> _ who had headed the <PERSON> Vichy </PERSON> government during World War II _ went on trial. -LRB- He was condemned to death, but his sentence was commuted. -RRB- In 1951, <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Petain </PERSON> died.

<TEXT>
 Nearly a quarter-century after visitors to the 1964 <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>'s Fair were introduced to the Picturephone, the see-as-you talk concept is being offered again. The cost is lower, but so is the technology. Unlike the moving images of the Picturephone, which let fair-goers see as well as hear the person on the other end of the wire, the new devices produce only a freeze-frame shot. And industry analysts still question whether the home video phone's time has come. `` The issue is behavior,'' said <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Noll </PERSON>, a professor of communications at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> who worked for <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in new product planning in the mid-1970s. Using the telephone is akin to `` whispering in the ear. Seeing somebody almost destroys the intimacy of the communication,'' he said. `` When we ask an audience whether they want to see on the phone, half or more say no.'' <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> officials recognize the psychological barrier Picturephone ran into, but the company believes its VisiTel visual phone display unit, introduced in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last November, will fare better. VisiTel, the only consumer product of its kind now on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market, has a camera lens that projects the user's image onto a black-and-white, 4.5-inch screen. The image can be transmitted to another VisiTel user in about five seconds. Since the unit uses ordinary phone lines, the same calling rates apply when the Visitel is used as when an ordinary phone is used. `` This is a passive product,'' said <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Beck </PERSON>, national sales manager for the visual telecommunications division of <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sales </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's not like picking up the phone and immediately your picture is there. It only transmits when you hit the send key,'' he said. <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> said VisiTels, retailing for about $ 400 each, are selling `` very well.'' The company has orders for about 64,000 units and has delivered about 36,000 of them, he said. Two other Japanese companies, <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Matsushita </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Panasonic </ORGANIZATION> division, are planning to put similar products on the market by Christmas A variety of companies, such as <ORGANIZATION> PictureTel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Peabody </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, sell devices that transmit moving images, but those are more expensive and require higher-grade phone lines. They are mostly for businesses. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's Picturephone initially was aimed at the residential caller. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> set up phones at central locations in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. People could place calls from a Picturephone at one of these locations to a Picturephone at another location, where family or friends would be awaiting their pre-arranged call. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> said it would extend service to other parts of the country if demand was large enough, and a June 1964 press release said, `` There is no telling when <PERSON> Picturephone </PERSON> sets in the home will be as common as telephones are today.'' `` The problem was the technology was just ahead of its time. There was n't the demand for it,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Whaite </PERSON>, manager of <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's corporate staff for teleconferencing application development. `` People did n't want themselves seen in what you would call the private home environment. It just was n't appealing to the public.'' It was also expensive to install and to use. Rates ranged from $ 16 to $ 27 for the first three minutes at one of the Picturephone centers. Installing a Picturephone in someone's home would have cost thousands of dollars for special wiring to connect the device to the phone network. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T eventually turned its attention away from residential prospects and focused on the business community. Businesses were more receptive to two-way video, but the growth of what came to be known as teleconferencing was also slow because of the high cost of equipment and the special circuits required. Even by the late 1970s, it cost about half a million dollars to equip a room with video monitors, cameras and special wiring, <PERSON> Whaite </PERSON> said. Technological advances began bringing the cost down significantly in the 1980s and by the mid-1980s teleconferencing was becoming more attractive to companies trying to cut travel costs and open more lines of communication. Now, an estimated 150 to 200 companies have their own teleconferencing networks ranging in size from two to 45 sites, said <PERSON> Elliot </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gold </PERSON>, a teleconferencing consultant based in <LOCATION> Altadena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. Technology has much further to go before moving pictures can be transmitted over ordinary phone lines at reasonable costs to the consumer, and estimates of when that will happen range from seven to 10 years at the earliest But even when the technology develops, many see acceptance in the business community as the key to unlocking the residential market for video phones. `` Business started with personal computers, and then they went into the home. It followed the business application because lots of people take their work home,'' Whaite said. Home video phones `` will follow the same pattern, but it will probably be a slower evolution ... and it will never get to the proportions it will in the business environment,'' he said. <PERSON> Noll </PERSON> is more skeptical. `` I do n't think the problem is technology. I think it's behavior,'' he said `` There is something inherent in people and the way they communicate that does n't fit into this technology. `` We're 20 years into this idea -LRB- see-as-you-talk phones -RRB- and everybody is predicting it's going to take off and it does n't take off. That should tell us something.''

<HEAD>The Typical Democratic Delegate: White, Middle-Aged, Well-Educated</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD L. VERNACI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Fewer than a dozen politicians are among the delegates to the 1988 Democratic National Convention, the party's biggest political event At least that's how many own up to being politicians. An Associated Pess survey of more than 3,200 of the 4,161 delegates to the convention found that while nearly 1,000 of them hold elected offices _ including hundreds of members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and dozens of governors and mayors _ only a handful list their occupation as `` politician.'' To be exact, there are nine of them. They join nearly 300 lawyers, 100 retired people, an actor, a cook and a casket manufacturer this week as they cram into the cramped auditorium of the Omni to nominate <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for president. Of the delegates _ who hail from all 50 states, the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, and five <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> territories _ the typical convention-goer is white, middle-aged and college-educated. Almost two-thirds of them have not been delegates before, the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> survey found. Their average age is 47, some 67 percent went to college and 69 percent are white. Twenty-one percent are black and almost 5 percent are Hispanic. Under Democratic Party rules, the delegate seats are divided equally among men and women, and while there are no firm quotas, state parties were encouraged to recruit enough minorities so the racial mix of the delegation roughly parallels that of the state's <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> voters Still, there was some irritation at the party's affirmative action program. `` We went from unfair to more unfair,'' said <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Povman </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> delegate from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Under the rules, a person can get the most votes and be elected by the people and yet not be selected as a delegate, not because <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> does n't want you, but because if you're a white Catholic and they have enough white Catholics, they'll pick a black whatever.'' While no floor fights are expected over the presidential nomination, credentials challenges or changes to the rules, the delegates come to town with a lot weighing on their minds. A sampling of those surveyed by the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> found that about a third of them are worried about the federal budget deficit, unemployment, foreign trade or the economy in general. Next on the list is combatting the flow of illegal drugs into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, followed by education and the twin issues of world peace and nuclear arms control. `` I have a son who would be of age to go into service,'' said <PERSON> Hilda </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourg </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> delegate from <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. `` I want to keep the nation at peace.'' Asked his opinion of the nation's No. 1 issue, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Logsdon </PERSON>, a sheriff from <LOCATION> Elizabethtown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, replied: `` As someone in law enforcement, drugs. I think we need to quit calling it a war and make it one.'' Even with few issues to be fought out and so few self-confessed politicians in attendance, politics _ that nasty business _ found its way into the process. Asked if she thought the Democrats had devised a fair way of picking delegates, <PERSON> Cyrel </PERSON> <PERSON> Foote </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> delegate from <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, complained: `` No, there's a lot of politics involved.''

<HEAD>Ann Richards: Good Ol' Speaker for Democratic Convention</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEN HERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Treasurer <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>, the keynote speaker for the Democratic National Convention, says she learned how to act like a good ol' boy from the best ol' boy she knew _ her father. As a child growing up in <LOCATION> Waco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, she would sometimes make the drugstore rounds with her father <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON>, a pharmaceutical salesman who knew that small talk could lead to big sales. `` That's where I first learned how good ol' boys talk to each other. There's a lot of laughing and a lot of hurrahing and a lot of back-slapping and a lot of fish stories,'' Ms. <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> recalled. `` It's tremendously important because it is a bond. It's a link that lays the predicate for whatever serious business you have to do. It kept women out because we did n't know how to do it. And we're still not very good at it,'' she said. But those who have watched Ms. <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>' career say she has become a master at good ` ol boy talk, and it is a key to her success In 12 years she has gone from housewife to county commissioner to state treasurer to likely candidate for governor in 1990. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Railroad Commissioner <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>, state chairman of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' presidential campaign and a friend of Ms. <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>, remembers taking her to meet some oilmen friends in <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION>. `` I came back from the rest room and <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> and these oil guys were sitting there on their hands and knees shooting dice up against the wall. Had there been money passing hands, those guys would still be paying debt. She had all the little scraps of paper in front of her,'' <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> said. `` That little story probably illustrates the secret of her popularity. She has never met a stranger. She always fits in,'' he said. Earlier in her life, Ms. <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>, now 54, fit into the traditional female role of the day. Politics played little part in it. `` I can remember a time in my life when I would n't give a recipe to a friend because that was the only form of power I had,'' she has told many audiences. She also remembers attending meetings of <ORGANIZATION> Girls </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, which includes a mock legislature run by and for girls. Politics remained largely a spectator sport for females. `` It was fun to pretend,'' she said of the Girls State sessions, `` but you did n't really think you were going to ever go back and do it yourself. I did n't think that until I was grown and had four kids.'' Her high school debate talents won her a scholarship to <ORGANIZATION> Baylor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, where she met <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>. They married while in college. She became a teacher in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> while he finished law school and later practiced law. In 1976, some friends called the <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>' home and asked <PERSON> David </PERSON> to run for county commissioner. He could not make the race. So they turned to Ms. <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>, who had helped engineer victories for two female legislative candidates, and she eventually said yes. She upset an incumbent and kept the job until 1982 when she ran for state treasurer, trying to follow two unlikely-named treasurers _ <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, who held the job for almost 40 years, and <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Harding </PERSON>, who eventually was indicted for official misconduct. Ms. <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> took 47 percent of the vote and advanced to a Democratic runoff against <PERSON> Harding </PERSON>. He withdrew and Ms. <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> handily beat a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> challenger. She was re-elected without opposition in 1986 and has been credited with taking a quill-pen agency into the computer era. The political success came despite personal problems. In 1980, at her family's urging, she sought treatment for alcoholism. She says she has not had a drink since then. In 1984, <PERSON> David </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> were divorced. She said it was as amicable a split as possible. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> was on hand to congratulate his ex-wife on the day the Democrats picked her as keynote speaker. In her dozen years as an elected official, Ms. <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>' has become a favorite speaker on the political circuit. She uses her wicked wit to make points, but not injure. `` Now are there any other white men who have n't spoken yet?'' she said when she recently followed several white men as speakers at a Democratic fund-raiser. `` God knows we do n't want to leave any of you out.''

 Nine drugs and vaccines created through biotechnology have reached the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market and 81 others are in the final stages of development, according to an industry-sponsored survey released today. `` Biotechnology, a relatively young technology, obviously has matured,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceutical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said in releasing what it called the most comprehensive survey on the subject to date. A strong business commitment to biotechnology is benefiting the public by creating products that can unclog heart vessels, ease transplants and treat diseases such as diabetes, leukemia and hemophilia, the Washington-based group stated in a news release. `` Biotechnology is changing the very nature of this industry and will have a profound effect on medical treatment in the years ahead,'' the group's president, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mossinghoff </PERSON>, said in a prepared statement. But the heated competition between companies also is leading to conflicts over property rights, because many companies are at work on similar products, the industry organization said. `` Uncertainty over property rights and lack of information about patents could lead to wasted resources, longer development times and higher development costs,'' the group said. The survey also found: _ Forty of the 81 drugs and vaccines in development are for various types of cancers, making cancer the most frequently targeted disease of biotechnology-based products _ Seven of the 81, none yet approved, are aimed at AIDS _ Americans won 80 percent of the 206 genetic engineering patents issued by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> last year, while <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was a distant second with about 9 percent, the survey found _ <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> corporations led the list of recipients of genetic engineering patents last year, with 45 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Sloan-Kettering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> research institution, was the top receipient of genetic engineering patents last year, with 13. But the rest of the top four were all private companies: <ORGANIZATION> Cetus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, with 11; <ORGANIZATION> Ortho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceutical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, with nine; and <ORGANIZATION> Genentech </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Eli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lilly </ORGANIZATION>, each with eight. Of the products already on the market, the best-known are <ORGANIZATION> Genentech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s heart attack drug, Activase, which dissolves blood clots; <ORGANIZATION> Merck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s hepatitis B vaccine; and <ORGANIZATION> Eli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lilly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s genetically-engineered human insulin for diabetics The 81 products in development include 67 that are being tested on people in clinical trials and 14 that have completed trials and are awaiting approval by the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. Patent protection for biotechnology advances is critical because companies want to make sure that they will be able to earn a fair return on their heavy investments. The Office of Patents and Trademarks has cut down the backlog of biotechnology patent applications, to 6,500 from 7,800 a year ago, but it still takes an average of more than four years to process applications, the <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceutical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said. To deal with the backlog, the patent office is reorganizing and assigning a larger portion of new examiners at higher pay to biotech patents. The goal is to cut the processing time to 18 months by 1993 or 1994, the association said.

 The dollar retreated against the Japanese yen today in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, while share prices topped the 28,000-point barrier in active trading on the stock exchange. The dollar started trading at 132.90 yen before peaking at 133.08 yen, its high for the day, during the morning session. It fell steadily in afternoon dealings before closing trading at 132.70 yen, down 0.63 yen from Monday's 133.33 yen. It reached a low of 132.60 yen at one point. `` The dollar is being thrown around by comments from various people in the financial circle,'' said a dealer at a major securities firm, speaking on condition of anonymity. He said the currency reacted today to a statement by a high-ranking <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> official that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is ready to tolerate a higher dollar. `` The dollar is going to be sensitive until the release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures'' scheduled for Friday, said the dealer. He added that the currency is likely to move between a range of 131-133 yen prior to the announcement. The dollar has been forced lower in the past by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade reports showing a growing imbalance of imports over exports. But recent reports have shown improvements in the trade gap and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency has stabilized. However, the dealer said sentiment in the market seemed to show that traders do not expect an improvement in the May figures. `` The last two months were good so this time it may be bad,'' he said. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues built on its 68.91-point gain registered Monday and added a further 113.85 points, or 0.40 percent, for a 28,099.84 total by the end of trading. The index last closed on the 28,000-point level on June 20 when it finished trading at 28,139.03. `` The gain was better than expected,'' said the securities dealer. `` Summer is usually a slow season for stock trading.'' Traders attributed the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> gain to activity centered on large-capital issues, including steel and heavy industrials. Volume on the first section was estimated at 1.9 billion shares, up from 1.1 billion shares Monday. `` Prices will fluctuate,'' said the dealer. `` But the market is basically strong.''

<HEAD>Japan's Trade Surplus Continues to Decline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s trade surplus shrank 16 percent during the first half of 1988 as booming imports outstripped a moderate increase in exports, the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday. Analysts said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was a major beneficiary of the increased imports. The ministry said in its preliminary report <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s trade surplus during the first six months of the year was $ 33.7 billion, or $ 6.4 billion less than in the first half of 1987. In June, the country had a surplus of $ 5.92 billion, down $ 668.3 million from the same month last year. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> dipped 14.9 percent, from $ 24.6 billion to $ 20.9 billion for the first half of this year compared with the same period in 1987. The ministry attributed the rapid decline in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s trade surplus to the steep increase in imports, fueled by the nearly 100 percent rise in the value of the Japanese yen against the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar in the last three years. The stronger yen made foreign products cheaper in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and Japanese products more expensive abroad. The rising yen boosted the country's imports by 34.3 percent to $ 91.8 billion for the first six months of 1988 on a custom-cleared basis, while exports rose 15.7 percent to $ 125.4 billion. The statistics showed American exporters, bolstered by the weak dollar, are increasing their sales in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> faster than European and Asian exporters. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest trading partner. <PERSON> Sumio </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoga </PERSON>, director of the ministry's export department, said Americans sold more office equipment, aircraft and capital goods to Japanese while Japanese automobile exports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> continued its downward trend. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is clearly a beneficiary of the yen appreciation,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerstenhaber </PERSON>, a senior economist with <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. `` American exports to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is clearly outstripping its imports from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> ... and the trend is very unlikely to change.'' Analysts see the decline in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s surplus and its increase in imports as the beginning of a long trend. `` The figures for the first six months confirmed that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is streadily heading the way to becoming an importing country,'' said <PERSON> Josen </PERSON> <PERSON> Takahashi </PERSON>, a chief analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> think tank. `` Imports are growing at much faster pace than we expected. It seems like a matter of time until <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s account marks a deficit,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which soared to the top of the toy industry in the mid-1980s with its Cabbage Patch Kids and then skidded into debt as the dolls' popularity waned, announced today it filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law. <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> said the filing, which did not include its Canadian and other foreign subsidiaries, was made Monday evening in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Court for the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>. The toymaker said the filing followed the refusal of its short-term bank lenders to agree to provide the company with an adequate working capital credit line. <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> also announced that <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Handel </PERSON>, who is recovering from recent open-heart surgery, has submitted his resignation as chief executive officer, citing the company's need for a full-time CEO during this period. He will continue as chairman of the company. The board of directors appointed <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON>, currently president and chief operating officer, as president and chief executive officer. The bankruptcy filing had been expected after <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> was unable to persuade its bondholders to agree to a $ 335 million debt restructuring. The company lost $ 47.4 million in the quarter that ended April 2 and has suffered losses in four of the past five years, including $ 215 over the last two years. <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> owes more than $ 100 million to a group of foreign and domestic lenders. In recent weeks, the company has tried to raise cash by selling off some of its product lines. On Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest toymaker, said it had agreed to purchase some of <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION>'s assets and lines for $ 21 million, including the plastic wading and splashing pools and children's outdoor furniture Those lines, which helped launched <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> in the toy business in 1956, had sales last year of $ 77 million. <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> also has slashed its work force in an effort to cut costs. It currently has fewer than 600 employees in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, down from an average of 2,500 last year. Besides Cabbage Patch Kids, <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> manufactures <PERSON> Alf </PERSON> dolls, Big Wheels plastic tricycles and board games, such as Scrabble. Industry sources say the company holds about 5 percent of the nation's toy market. Analysts said the same aggressive management style that helped <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> hit the jackpot with the gamble on Cabbage Patch Kids in 1983 helped bring on its troubles. The dolls, introduced in 1983 after a number of other toy companies rejected the product, helped <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> end 1985 in its strongest financial condition ever, with sales of $ 776 million and record earnings of $ 64 million. But the Cabbage Patch fad abated and analysts said the company did not pare its costs soon enough. When the toy industry suffered a slump in 1987, the company was hit particularly hard. <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> has faced tough times before. It entered the snowmobile business in 1972, but snowfalls were light for the next three years, the economy was depressed and losses were heavy. The company posted a $ 22 million loss in 1978, threatening its survival. In 1980 the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> charged <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> with misstating its financial results to mask troubles. In 1982 the company began a move toward prosperity with the introduction of its ColecoVision home video game system. The company saw its future in electronics, and in 1983 unveiled its $ 600 Adam home computer. <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> was a monumental flop, while sales of ColecoVision cooled. The company lost $ 79.8 million in 1984 despite $ 540 million in sales of Cabbage Patch Kids.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Futures Open Mixed To Higher</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Grain and soybean futures opened mixed to higher today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, recovering slightly from Monday's steep losses in cautious trading ahead of an eagerly awaited crop report. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report, due out after the close, was to include revised production estimates for wheat, corn and soybeans. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> normally does not revise its springtime production estimates until August. But government experts decided to revise the figures in today's report to reflect the effects of the drought. <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Karlin </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, predicted the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> would be conservative in estimating drought damage. `` This report will be based on computer models,'' he said. `` Once you get into the August report, you have extension agents going out in the fields and doing some sample surveys.'' Prices for grain and soybean futures fell sharply Monday in reaction to weekend rains in the Corn Belt and forecasts for more showers this week. In early trading, wheat was 3 -RCB- cents to 5 \ cents higher with the contract for delivery in July at $ 3.72 a bushel; corn was 1 -RCB- cents lower to 7 -RCB- cents higher with July at $ 2.96 a bushel; oats were 5 -LCB- cents lower to 11 cents higher with July at $ 2.77 a bushel; soybeans were 5 cents lower to 14 cents higher with July at $ 8.72 a bushel Cattle futures were mostly lower while pork futures were mostly higher in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle settled .37 cent lower to .25 cent higher with August at 66.15 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .17 cent to .55 cent lower with August at 75.70 cents a pound; hogs were .02 cent lower to .57 cent higher with July at 45.50 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .08 cent to .55 cent higher with July at 33.10 cents a pound.

 The number of Americans changing residences dipped after the 1984-85 burst of home sales triggered by falling interest rates, the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> says. Some 3 million fewer Americans moved between 1985-86 than in the previous year, with virtually all of the drop occuring in the category of moves within the same county, according to the geographical mobility report released Tuesday by the bureau. Lower interest rates unleashed a pent-up demand for new homes in the 1984-85 year, spurring the mobility rate to 20.2 percent, highest in this decade, said <PERSON> Kristin </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, an analyst in the bureau's Population Division. But in 1985-86 the rate of movement slipped back to 18.6 percent, a decline, but still the second highest rate in the 1980s, she said. The figures are the most recent detailed statistics on mobility available. However, data collected by the departments of <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> indicate that continued low interest rates helped spur strong sales of both new and existing homes last year. Mobility rates fell to all-time lows early in this decade, Ms. <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said, as people postponed their quests for better homes because of high interest rates. The mobility low of 16.6 percent of Americans age 1 and over was achieved in 1982-83, Census figures show. The level was about 20 percent throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Mobility statistics were first recorded in 1948, when it was found that 19.9 percent of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> had moved in the previous year. In the 1970s, Ms. <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> explained, rates of moving declined because of the decline in the size of families. People no longer needed to seek larger homes to accommodate more people, she commented. Also, there was a slight increase in homeownership in that period, and owners are less likely to relocate than renters. In the 1985-86 year the main change was in the number of residents who oved within the same county, 13.1 percent compared to 11.3 percent a year earlier. `` Local reasons for moving are usually housing-related or changes in life cycles'' she said, such as children moving to their own homes, getting married and so forth. Regionally, the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> continued to lose people to other regions, with a net loss of 250,000 movers, while the West continued to gain, receiving about 200,000. The <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> reversed its recent pattern of loss, however, gaining about 15,000 interstate movers in the year, while the influx to the South was down to only 35,000 new residents. Ms. <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> speculated that this is a result of the recent problems in the energy industry in such southern states as <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, which are no longer attracting workers from the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. Indeed, many who moved there to work in oil fields may be heading back home, she said. By age, the rate of movement is highest among young adults and declines with age, Ms. <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> observed. And by race, blacks tend to move more than whites. While many factors are at work, mobility generally declines as income increases. Those with less money are more likely to be renters, while higher income people tend to own homes and may be tied to an area by business and professional relationships. Here is a rundown of the overall share of Americans aged 1 and over who moved over one-year periods.

 A year ago, the British mass-market jeweler <ORGANIZATION> Ratners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> spent about $ 200 million to acquire an Ohio-based jewelry company. The experience was so positive, the transaction so simple, and the rewards potentially so great, that <ORGANIZATION> Ratners </ORGANIZATION> since has snapped up two more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies. <ORGANIZATION> Ratners </ORGANIZATION> embodies a veritable 10-year tradition among the British, who are the most prolific acquirers of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses, followed by the Canadians, West Germans, French and Japanese. Those expecting to see a slowdown tied to the dollar's recent resurgence in foreign-exchange trading may be disappointed. Like a tycoon buying a fine diamond for his mistress, corporate suitors from abroad still act as if money is no object, at least not now. Last year, foreigners spent $ 40.4 billion on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> acquisitions; in the first six months of this year, the tally registered $ 21 billion by some estimates. Those involved in the deals _ from investment bankers to the purchasers themselves _ say the status of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency is of little consequence as long as it does n't really skyrocket. `` It's a commercial strategy, not the exchange rate that's going to influence us,'' said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Coppel </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Ratners </ORGANIZATION>' group finance director, from his <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> office. Since its long decline bottomed out recently, the dollar's value has risen as much as 10 percent against some major currencies. Most foreign companies with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> operations are active participants in the currency markets, buying and selling dollars as a hedge against swings in the exchange rate. W.T. <ORGANIZATION> Grimm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a Chicago-based firm that tracks mergers and acquisitions, noted that foreigners often end up paying even more for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies than American acquirers. While <PERSON> Grimm </PERSON> attributed that to their `` aggressive entry into the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market,'' investment bankers look to more practical considerations. For one thing, `` You've got a lengthier process of negotiating a contract simply because you must bring all your troops from your home country, and they're not familiar with the process,'' said <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Fabuss </PERSON>, a senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. In addition, foreigners often do not initiate their own, exclusive transactions. `` It's hard for them to say, ` I want company X' and go out and try to get it. They tend to appear in auction situations where the highest price wins, and currency allows them to pay slightly more,'' he added. Last year, foreign buyers announced 220 takeover deals, accounting for 11 percent of all the mergers and acquisitions in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Grimm </PERSON> reported. Nearly half of those deals carried price tags of $ 100 million or more, with the average price of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> company totaling a record $ 315.4 million. Most of the takeovers occurred in the retail, chemicals and industrial equipment and machinery Among the billion-dollar deals so far this year are the British construction company <ORGANIZATION> Beazer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>'s purchase of <ORGANIZATION> Koppers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and Canadian investor <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION>'s acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Currently under way is the sale of at least a dozen units of the <ORGANIZATION> Singer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to help finance <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON>'s purchase of the machinery and defense company A number of foreigners are bidding on those operations. Despite their willingness to pay top dollar for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> properties, foreigners are still finding some relative bargains here. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said American factories outperformed their rivals overseas last year in reducing labor costs and making their goods more competitive on world markets. Measured in devalued American dollars, labor costs in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> declined 1.5 percent in 1987, compared with increases of 7.5 percent in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, 7.7 percent in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, 13.5 p \ _ Z -RRB- ss, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> Finding an American mate takes some looking. <PERSON> Coppel </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Ratners </ORGANIZATION> began assessing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market in September 1986 and quickly realized the `` enormous potential of the $ 20 billion-a-year -LRB- jewelry -RRB- market.'' With the help of <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ratners </ORGANIZATION> zeroed in on <ORGANIZATION> Sterling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, headquartered in <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. The deal closed less than a year later. Of particular interest to <ORGANIZATION> Ratners </ORGANIZATION> was Sterling's diamond expertise. Savvy in buying raw gemstones in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sterling </PERSON> has shown <ORGANIZATION> Ratners </ORGANIZATION> how to cut costs so much that <PERSON> Coppel </PERSON> predicted the company's diamond business would jump from 12 percent to 20 percent of total sales. `` Since then we've been able to acquire two other companies at a much more favorable -LRB- exchange -RRB- rate,'' <PERSON> Coppel </PERSON> said, referring to the privately held jewelers <ORGANIZATION> Osterman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Westhall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION>. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lodge </PERSON>, a professor at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s business school, said that the type of company helps determine the price foreigners are willing to pay. `` If you're coming here to acquire the latest American technology in gene-splitting, the dollar rate is not as important'' because intellectual assets are harder to value, he said. `` On the other hand, if you are coming here to set up an auto factory, then the exchange rate becomes more important.'' Political pressure has kept the technologically aggressive Japanese from bidding on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> high-tech companies, but politics may also be contributing to the foreign merger wave. `` As the politics of trade become more intense, Japanese and European companies regard a holding in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> as a protector of their access to our marketplace,'' <PERSON> Lodge </PERSON> said. As the flow of business across the oceans increases, investment banking companies have responded by paying more attention to courting overseas clients. Over the past year, <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> has opened full-service offices in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, rather than relying on small branches. <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is looking east for growth. Employment in the company's <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> office has jumped to 400 from 290 less than two years ago. In addition, the company has established a `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> group'' in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to facilitate transactions between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Japanese businesses, a spokesman said. At <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, a new unit was established in April specifically to work on foreign direct investment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The operation's 20-member staff currently has `` several major deals in the works,'' said bank spokesman <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>. While foreigners are reveling in all the dollars their currencies can buy, some of the Americans doing business with them are n't so happy. One investment banker on a recent business trip in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> complained that his $ 435-a-night room at the elegant hotel <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Crillon </PERSON> was a mere `` broom closet.'' Lamenting how few francs his dollar buys, he said, `` Why is it <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> chardonnays now make sense?''

 The next administration should push for new gains in energy efficiency, and without sacrifice for conscientious consumers, an advocacy group said Tuesday. Such a goal should incorporate an auto fuel-economy requirement of 45 miles per gallon, a 50-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax increase and a high `` gas-guzzler'' tax to be rebated to buyers of fuel efficient cars, said the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> for an Energy-Efficient Economy. The report, produced by a panel of environmentalists, academics and business executives, argued that abundant opportunities for efficiency gains are the best way to counter several threats at once _ acid rain, excessive dependence on imported oil, international competition and the `` greenhouse'' warming of the earth by man-made gases, notably the carbon dioxide produced by burning fossil fuels. Also Tuesday, a related report was issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Safe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, an advocacy group supported by several environmental organizations and others, arguing that nuclear power has had virtually no effect in holding down oil use `` and can not have any substantial impact in the foreseeable future.'' The communications council also argued for a 45 mpg fuel-economy standard, to be raised to 60 mpg in the year 2008. Unlike many reports advocating the pursuit of efficiency, the study by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> an </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy-Efficient </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economy </ORGANIZATION> explicitly argued that efficiency should be pursued only as long as it's cost-effective _ with environmental and balance-of-trade costs taken into account. Some of the authors told a news conference that point is a long way away. `` The opportunities are proliferating ... the marketing folks have n't been able to keep up with the engineers,'' said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Geller </PERSON>, associate director of the council. Asked which party was more likely to be receptive to the recommendations, <PERSON> Geller </PERSON> said, `` We would hope any administration would accept this agenda and push it forward.'' `` It's been a great disaster that conservation has been associated with sitting in the dark,'' said another author, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Socolow </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. The report listed 10 improvements it considered still possible, the largest being transmissions with continuously variable gear ratios, estimated to improve efficiency by 12 percent. The second best improvement, at 8 percent, would be engines with four valves per cylinder. That design already has been incorporated in several models in the past two or three years. Cars currently must get 26 mpg, and buyers will not demand mileage above about 30 mpg because annual savings are small, the authors said. The higher standards could mean cars would cost $ 200 to $ 800 more initially, but this would be recovered over the lifetime of the car in reductions in operating costs, they said. A 50-cent tax would make sure `` consumers are given a price signal that better reflects the real cost of the resource and encourages conservation,'' and some of the $ 40 billion to $ 60 billion raised each year could be returned to the poor through income tax provisions. The tax should be imposed in increments of 10 cents per year for five years, the report said. If oil prices double, the tax should be held to 30 cents. If fuel efficiency gains are disappointing, the tax could climb higher. The gas-guzzler tax, which currently can exceed $ 2,000 for certain luxury cars, should be broadened to raise funds for rebates, perhaps $ 1,000, on fuel-efficent cars, the report said. The rebates could apply to models 50 percent better than today's best, the report said This would imply payments for cars getting about 75 mpg.

<HEAD>Survey Says American Attitudes Growing More Negative Toward Drugs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Americans' attitudes toward illegal drug use have grown more antagonistic over the past year, according to a study released Tuesday by a volunteer group that has been trying to de-glamorize drug abuse with a public service advertising campaign. The group, which calls itself the Media-Advertising Partnership for a <LOCATION> Drug-Free </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, says the nation's media outlets donated more than $ 150 million in free space and time for the barrage of ads it made available in the first year of the anti-drug campaign. The campaign was launched in March 1987. The amount of donated space fell short of the $ 500 million that the group had set as its target for each year of the three-year campaign. But campaign organizers said they were pleased with the results nonetheless and hope media outlets will find significantly more space and time for the ads this year. The television ads broke into the top 10 with consumers surveyed by the independent <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Storyboard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tests </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> last year, the first time a public service campaign appeared in that list in the 10 years it has been compiled. One of the more popular ads that the Media-Advertising Partnership created is a television commercial that shows a man breaking an egg, scrambling it and frying it, saying that is what happens to your brain when you take drugs. In addition to making 32 television ads, 25 radio commercials and 80 print ads, the group had a benchmark survey of attitudes toward illegal drug use done in February-March 1987 and followed that up in the same period this year to see if those attitudes had changed. The research firm <ORGANIZATION> Gordon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, said more than 4,650 people across the country completed questionnaires for each survey. The latest study said the change in attitude was most pronounced among college students, which had been among the first groups in the 1960s to increase consumption of illegal drugs but is now showing a greater fear of the consequences of drug abuse. `` Even more impressive is the first evidence of a decline in occasional cocaine use,'' the study said. Occasional cocaine use among college students has dropped to 6 percent from 11 percent a year earlier, it said, while occasional usage by friends had dropped to 31 percent from 36 percent. The survey said teenagers displayed the fewest changes in attitude, although they generally took a dimmer view of drug use and the drug user than they had a year earlier. The changes among children aged 9-12 and adults over age 18 showed improvement but fell in between those for college students and teens, it said. On a more disconcerting note, the study said it found 18 percent of the children surveyed said they had been approached to buy or use drugs, up from 16 percent a year earlier. It also said parents appear to have become more unrealistic about their own children's behavior. Forty-one percent of parents surveyed said it was either certainly or probably untrue that `` my children are likely to try drugs sometime,'' up from 36 percent a year earlier. But that result appeared to be at odds, the study said, with other findings that includes 76 percent of the 16 - and 17-year-olds surveyed saying they had friends who use marijuana occasionally The survey said there was evidence that the group's advertising `` played a major role'' in changing attitudes. <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said it identified 10 markets that used the most anti-drug advertising, and said people living in those areas `` show a far larger shift in their attitudes toward drugs than in the balance of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.''

<TEXT>
 Grain and soybean futures closed moderately higher Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in cautious trading ahead of an eagerly awaited crop report. `` Overall, by recent standards, it was a fairly dull session,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Spilka </PERSON>, a grain analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. The rally was basically a technical rebound after three days of sharply lower prices, <PERSON> Spilka </PERSON> said. He said gains probably were limited by edginess over the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> crop report, which was released after the close. News that the report's revised production estimates for corn, soybeans and spring wheat would be based on conditions as of Tuesday instead of July 1 prompted a buying flurry early in the session, <PERSON> Spilka </PERSON> said. In the report, the agency estimated 1988 soybean production at 1.65 billion bushels, compared with a June estimate of 1.88 billion and 1987 production of 1.9 billion bushels. This year's corn harvest was estimated at 5.2 billion bushels, compared with the June estimate of 7.3 billion and year-ago production of 7.1 billion. Production of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat this year was estimated at 1.84 billion bushels, compared with the June estimate of 2.12 billion and 1987 production of 2.1 billion. At the close, wheat was 9 \ cents to 12 -RCB- cents higher with the contract for delivery in July at $ 3.79 a bushel; corn was 12 \ cents to 17 \ cents higher with July at $ 3.05 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 1 -LCB- cents to 18 cents higher with July at $ 2.84 a bushel; soybeans were 10 -LCB- cents to 26 cents higher with July at $ 8.84

 <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> has unilaterally postponed payments on as much as $ 850 million in Republic of <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> bonds scheduled to mature this year, the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. The five-year bonds, issued in 1983, will be paid between May 1990 and June 1992, according to the government's Official Gazette of June 14. The bonds had originally been scheduled to mature in June of this year. The notes subject to postponement are held by Venezuelan government entities, and their non-payment should not affect the nation's credit rating, foreign bankers in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> said. The government paid off another $ 100 million in Republic of <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> bonds maturing this year that were held by private investors, a <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> source said. The payment delay comes as the government attempts to safeguard its reserves of foreign currencies in the face of declining oil income. Finance Minister <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurtado </PERSON> has estimated that <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> will have a balance-of-payments deficit this year of around $ 4 billion. <PERSON> Hurtado </PERSON> is in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> this week for meetings with the world banking community, the ministry said.

<HEAD>Merrill Lynch Net Off 36 Percent In Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday said lower financial activity contributed to a 36 percent drop in its second-quarter profit. <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>, one of the nation's largest investment houses, said net income totaled $ 53.5 million, or 47 cents a share, in the second quarter, compared with earnings of $ 83.3 million, or 75 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue during the quarter rose 8 percent, to $ 2.5 billion from $ 2.3 billion in the second quarter of 1987. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Schreyer </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer, said the results were `` reasonable considering the difficult business environment experienced during the quarter.'' He said the period was marked by `` a relatively lower level of activity in the financial markets.'' Commission revenues in the second quarter declined 35 percent to $ 393 million `` due to reduced stock market activity,'' the company said in a statement. Investment banking revenue also declined _ down 13 percent to $ 256 million _ reflecting a lower level of mergers and acqusitions closings But record fixed-income activity drove principal transaction revenue to $ 388 million, compared with a loss of $ 133 million a year ago. Insurance revenues of $ 85 million and asset management and custodial fee revenues of $ 122 million were little changed from the previous year. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Tully </PERSON>, president and chief operating officer, said the company is confident `` the cost-control and productivity improvement measures put into place during the first half are on course.'' For the first six months of 1988, net earnings totaled $ 122 million, or $ 1.08, off 36 percent from $ 192 million, or $ 1.72 a share in the first half of 1987. Revenue for the first six months totaled $ 4.9 billion, up 1 percent from $ 4.8 billion in the year-ago period.

 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> management was unimpressed with a four-year contract offer from its pilots, who claim they are offering $ 51.5 million a year in cost savings to the airline, an <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said Tuesday. `` The arithmetic they -LRB- the pilots -RRB- used totally distorts the proposal,'' <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said. `` The main point -LRB- is -RRB- they've hit us with a proposal that would increase our costs.'' He said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s calculations have found that the pilots' proposal would increase the airline's costs by $ 116 million annually <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> added that overall, cumulative increases in the pilots' offer would raise <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s costs by 33 percent. The pilots contended that the 5 percent increases in pay, along with stock, they are requesting would be more than offset by money-saving concessions in productivity rules and vacations. `` It would give -LRB- Eastern -RRB- some form of economic relief and at the same time, protect our pilots,'' said spokesman <PERSON> J.B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> local representing about 3,500 Eastern pilots. `` We think it's very fair.'' Eastern, losing an estimated $ 1 million daily, has said it must have wage and work-rule concessions from its three unions to cut labor costs by around 30 percent overall. The pilots' current contract became amendable this month. Eastern has been in federal mediation with its largest union, the 12,000-member Machinists, for nearly seven months. The pilots' proposal was designed to halt a `` downsizing'' of Eastern that's seen a steady reduction in the number of flights. The pilots estimate that by summer's end, nearly 1,000 Eastern pilots will have left the airline since the 1986 takeover by giant <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> _ many because of tense labor-management relations and uncertainty about the carrier's future. The pilots' proposal would include a `` fence agreement'' keeping Eastern separate from <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, a nonunion carrier also owned by Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>. Eastern unions say <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> wants to strip Eastern of its assets. The pilots' offer also calls for three 5 percent pay increases and one 3 percent raise, plus shares in <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> stock, over the life of the proposed four-year contract. One of the most critical proposals involves payment of an unspecified amount of money to pilots who have yet to take a vacation this year, the pilots said. Pilots would receive five days of vacation and be compensated for the rest. Those pilots who have taken a vacation this year would receive an unspecified amount of cash for any remaining vacation time due them. This proposal alone would save <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> $ 11 million, according to <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said it would be cheaper to hire new pilots. `` The pilot shortage thing is a myth. We have enough pilots to fly the schedule we intend to operate,'' <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said. Under the present contract, a pilot can fly 84 hours per month. Under the proposal, that would rise to 88 hours and go as high as 90 hours under a so-called buffer provision. That provision, according to <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION>, would save the airline another $ 9.5 millon annually. But <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said the pilots want time-and-a-half for the extra hours. A third element that would make more efficient use of the pilots would save the company another $ 31 million yearly, <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said Eastern calculated the savings at only $ 6.7 million. <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, after hearing of <PERSON> Matell </PERSON>'s remarks, said <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> stands by its calculations. `` That's certainly not the way it prints out,'' <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> said of Eastern's figures. `` We felt and still do that it's a very positive approach that would save the company some money,'' <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON> said, adding that the pilots' other priorities include maintaining Eastern as a large, separate airline. He said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> management has n't presented its own offer. `` They have not made a formal proposal as yet. That's just delaying the negotiations,'' said <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>.

 Stock prices fell today as investors showed concern over interest rates and the trade deficit. Stock market investors have dwelled lately on the possibility that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> will push up interest rates as a way to cool the economy and stave off inflation. Concerns about rising interest rates have dampened the stock market because more attractive yields on bonds could siphon money away from stocks. Also, high rates could hurt stock prices by slowing economic growth. A rise in agricultural commodity prices raised inflation fears, which hurt the bond market, analysts said. `` This is a market that's back-pedaling,'' said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>, an investment strategist for <ORGANIZATION> Gruntal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` Anxiety over higher interest rates is keeping players on the sidelines as well as stalling some of the summer sizzle that appears to lie ahead.''

 The dollar slipped Tuesday, as profit-taking pushed the currency lower against all major currencies except the Canadian dollar. Gold prices were mixed. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> quoted a late bid for gold of $ 436.25 as of 4 p.m. EDT, up from Monday's late bid of $ 434.50. Traders said they had expected a slight sell-off of the dollar, which rose to recent highs against several major currencies on Monday despite concerted central bank intervention. Concern that the central banks might step in again to sell dollars may have kept the currency from climbing, analysts said. The dollar's slow, measured decline began early in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and then continued when trading shifted to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the currency settled at the lows of the day. But traders said bullish sentiment surrounding the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency remains intact. `` The dollar has n't dropped very far _ there's still very good demand in the market,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON>, an assistant vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` People are re-examining what's ahead of us and squaring up their positions,'' he said, referring to the government's report on the nation's May trade deficit, which is due out Friday The consensus is that the May report will register about $ 11 billion, up from the $ 9.9 billion deficit reported for April, which was the lowest imbalance in three years. In the past, the dollar has plunged in response to an unexpected widening of the trade gap and soared when it narrowed.

In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar closed at 132.51 yen, down from 133.07 yen on Monday.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Prices Rise in Advance of Crop Report</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Grain and soybean futures prices moved moderately higher Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in cautious dealings ahead of the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s eagerly awaited monthly crop report. Analysts said the report, released after trading ended and forecasting a 24 percent decline in overall <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain production, should send prices higher when trading resumes on Wednesday. But they say weather forecasts will continue to dominate the markets. On other markets, livestock and meat futures were mixed; energy futures were mixed; precious metals were higher and stock-index futures retreated. Grain analysts called the crop report bullish for soybean prices, bearish for corn and slightly bearish for wheat. But the anticipated strength in soybeans was expected to offset the weakness in the grains, ultimately pulling all the grain markets higher Wednesday _ at least for a few minutes. `` After about three minutes of trading, they'll have worked off their report anxiety and we'll be looking at Friday's, Saturday's and Sunday's weather, which we see as hot, hot, hot,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Spilka </PERSON>, a grain analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` I do n't think the market's going to dwell on this report too long,'' agreed <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Karlin </PERSON>, chief research analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Based on conditions as of Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> predicted a 27 percent drop in corn production from 1987, a 14 percent drop in soybean production, and a wheat crop 13 percent smaller than that harvested last year. The corn harvest was estimated at 5.2 billion bushels, compared with the June estimate of 7.3 billion and year-ago production of 7.06 billion. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> estimated 1988 soybean production at 1.65 billion bushels, compared with a June estimate of 1.88 billion and 1987 production of 1.9 billion bushels. Production of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat was projected at 1.84 billion bushels, compared with the June estimate of 2.12 billion and 1987 production of 2.1 billion. Analysts called the corn and wheat estimates conservative. `` This just confirms everybody's opinion that there's some crop damage out there, and the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> is looking at a bit more of a problem in soybeans than the trade had anticipated,'' <PERSON> Spilka </PERSON> said. This year's planted soybean acreage, estimated by the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> at 58.52 million acres, was about 700,000 acres below market expectations. Planted corn acreage, estimated at 67.52 million acres, was about 500,000 acres more than expected. Grain and soybean futures advanced moderately ahead of the report, which was issued after the markets closed. Wheat settled 8 -RCB- cents to 13 \ cents higher with the contract for delivery in July at $ 3.81 \ a bushel; corn was 8 \ cents to 17 -RCB- cents higher with July at $ 3.06 a bushel; oats were 1 -LCB- cents lower to 15 cents higher with July at $ 2.79 a bushel; soybeans were 7 cents to 21 -LCB- cents higher with July at $ 8.79 -LCB- Cattle futures finished mixed while some pork futures advanced their daily limits on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in reaction to the rise in feed grain prices, said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Durchholz </PERSON>, a pork-market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> AgriVisor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. Traders expect livestock and meat prices to rise sharply next year after falling in the near term due to widespread producer selling of animals this summer because of the drought-driven rise in feed prices, he said The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> also reported the worst July 1 pasture conditions in history, which should encourage further drought-pattern trading on the livestock markets, said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Sterling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Analytical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. Live cattle settled .70 cent lower to .17 cent higher with August at 65.82 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent to .60 cent lower with August at 75.72 cents a pound; hogs were .20 cent to the limit 1.50 cents higher with July at 45.67 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .40 cent to the limit 2 cents higher with July at 33.10 cents a pound Crude oil prices weakened in volatile trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, but unleaded gasoline strengthened because of tight supplies and speculation about higher <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demand, analysts said. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 6 cents to 17 cents lower with August at $ 14.72 a barrel; heating oil was .15 cent to .68 cent lower with August at 40.65 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .06 cent lower to 1.35 cents higher with August at 53.48 cents a gallon. Precious metals futures posted modest gains on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Commodity Exchange due to the inflationary implications of higher grain prices and a weaker dollar Gold settled $ 2 to $ 2.30 higher with August at $ 438.70 a troy ounce; silver was 3.7 cents to 3.8 cents higher with July at $ 6.974 a troy ounce. Stock-index futures retreated on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for September delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled 3.10 points lower at 269.35.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Anacomp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, an Indiana-based computer services company, has signed a letter of intent to purchase the disk-drive maker <ORGANIZATION> Xidex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for about $ 415 million in cash, the companies announced Tuesday. Indianapolis-based <ORGANIZATION> Anacomp </ORGANIZATION>, the third largest supplier of micrographics products in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> behind <ORGANIZATION> 3M </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said it will pay $ 10 for each of <ORGANIZATION> Xidex </ORGANIZATION>'s 41.5 million outstanding shares. The transaction, which requires the approval of both boards of directors, will result in a company with annual sales of about $ 1 billion. A definitive agreement is expected to be reached by the end of the month, the companies said in a statement. A spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Anacomp </ORGANIZATION>, which is a customer of Xidex, said the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION> company is well managed and makes a good fit. `` Anacomp generally looks for a repetitive revenue base in making such acquisitions,'' said spokeswoman <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> McKee </PERSON>. `` We think we have a very solid marketing and distribution network that can maybe boost some of their other businesses.'' She said it is too soon to comment on whether layoffs would follow the merger. Xidex climbed $ 1.37 -LCB- a share to $ 9 in the over-the-counter trading, while <ORGANIZATION> Anacomp </ORGANIZATION> fell $ 1.12 -LCB- a share to close at $ 9.87 -LCB- on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Xidex, which has posted losses for two straight years due to writeoffs on acquisitions, is a leading manufacturer of computer data storage. It controls 25 percent of the world floppy disk market and also makes computer output microfilm, microfilm readers and reader printers. An analyst who follows both companies called the announcement a `` very attractive'' deal for both sides. `` The combined company will have $ 1 billion worth of annual sales, a capital base of around $ 800 million and very strong cash flows,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Obenzinger </PERSON> of Wood, <ORGANIZATION> Gundy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` You have a strong company in place as far as the competition is concerned,'' he added. Xidex spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennion </PERSON> said Chief Executive Officer <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaccaria </PERSON> had no comment. <ORGANIZATION> Anacomp </ORGANIZATION>, which employs more than 3,000 people, is a supplier and manufacturer of services and products based on micro-imaging technology known as micrographics. For the six months ended in March, <ORGANIZATION> Anacomp </ORGANIZATION> reported net income of $ 22.8 million, or 59 cents a share, on revenues of $ 200.9 million. Obenzinger estimated the company's profits will reach $ 45.5 million on revenues of about $ 400 million in the current fiscal year. Xidex has 7,000 employees worldwide, about half in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area at factories in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sunnyvale </LOCATION> and Fremont.

 <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday announced the release of its Lotus Agenda software designed to help people manage personal information. The company said the software allows users to organize personal minutiae such as ideas, notes, lists, messages, telephone numbers, addresses and schedules in a variety of categories. Development of the software began about 10 months ago, but the idea belonged to <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kapor </PERSON>, who would scribble notes and stuff them in his shirt pocket, only to lose them. <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> said its development program included more than 150 corporate and individual testers. Agenda is being credited as creating a new category of applications software called personal information management. The company said Agenda allows users to enter information `` on the fly,'' assign it to different categories as desired and observe it from multiple perspectives. Categories might include tasks, departments, people, issues. Lotus Agenda can be used to manage sales accounts, projects and calendars, examine news clips or just keep a list, the company said. <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agenda </ORGANIZATION> is priced at $ 395 and is available immediately.

<TEXT>
 Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> has the worst lifetime voting record on labor issues of any of the running mates <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was considering, according to an <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> rating. Nevertheless, union lobbyists on Tuesday were quick to praise the Democratic choice. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat was hailed for his role in salvaging labor's top legislative priority this year _ making companies give workers 60 days advance notice before closing their plants or laying them off `` <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was extremely helpful in recognizing that the two _ plant closing notices and the trade bill _ were compatible,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McGlotten </PERSON>, the 14.1-million-member labor federation's legislative director `` And he let his colleagues know how he felt.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> last week passed with a veto-proof 72-vote majority legislation requiring companies to provide 60 days advance notice of plant closings or layoffs involving more than 50 people. The House is expected to follow suit on Wednesday. Labor leaders demanded enactment of the mandatory layoff notices as the price for maintaining their support for a massive overhauling of the nation's trade laws that <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was a key player in crafting as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> vetoed the trade bill in May, citing the layoff notices that were then a part of it as his primary reason. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Booe </PERSON>, secretary-treasurer of the <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, and a member of the Democrats' platform-drafting committee, acknowledged that <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was not labor's main spear carrier on the trade and plant closing issues. `` But he did n't do a lot of the things that he could have done to mess us up, and there were a lot of other people urging him to,'' said <PERSON> Booe </PERSON>. `` I do n't think you can call him a labor hero, but he's been on our side more than he's been against us.'' As a three-term senator from a right-to-work state where less than 12 percent of the workers belong to unions, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> has always walked a fine line between conservative businessmen and labor activists in the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Despite a lifetime voting record of only 51 percent on labor issues, according to the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> labor leaders endorsed his re-election in 1982. All of the five other members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was considering as possible running mates have stronger COPE voting records. Another southerner, Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, had the highest _ 88 percent. But <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was listed as voting `` right'' on eight of 10 issues in 1987 that the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> considered in compiling its rankings, shoring up his support among labor leaders. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s only wrong votes were on raising the threshold on government construction contracts for which union-scale wages must be paid and giving employers who hire illegal aliens extensions before fining them. `` He's been all over the map,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerekes </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Work </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, a group that advocates state laws like the one in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> which outlaws labor contracts that require non-members to pay dues to unions that represent them. Earlier this year, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> came out against a so-called double-breasting bill that is the top priority of construction unions. The bill would prohibit unionized companies from operating non-union subsidiaries as a means of getting around wage and other provisions of labor contracts they've signed. But last month he voted against a measure to make violence on picket lines a federal crime, a reversal of his vote two years ago favoring such legislation. <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> members hold 751 of the 4,161 delegates at the Democratic convention opening next week in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. Combined with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associations </ORGANIZATION>' 280 delegates, about one-fourth of total that will nominate <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> come from the labor movement. `` Obviously, we would like to see somebody who had a 100 percent voting record,'' said <PERSON> McGlotten </PERSON>. `` But as you review things, a COPE record becomes less important than whether someone's door is open to us and understands our problems. He understands our problems.''

<HEAD>Steelmakers' Costs Up Because of Drought, But Orders May Be Cut
Later</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GARY, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The steel industry faces a possible reduction in orders as the drought reduces harvests and cuts the demand for new farm equipment, industry representatives said Tuesday. The drought also has increased operating costs by forcing steelmakers to contract for smaller, lighter ore barge loads that can navigate shallower waters near the <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> ore ranges. Steelmakers add, however, the drought likely will not harm the industry's recovery and the generally strong market for steel. <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Works </PERSON> produces tin-plated steel, among other products, for the canning industry, and <ORGANIZATION> Inland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which operates a facility in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, supplies steel to farm machinery manufacturers. `` There's some talk that canners, if the crops are lower, will be canning less, and that could have an effect on shipment,'' said <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuebler </PERSON>. `` Harvest time is still down the road for a lot of crops yet, so we do n't see any impact.'' An Inland newsletter said the company anticipates some customers might cut back on orders if the drought continues. `` Farm equipment manufacturers, in particular, may be hurt by declining sales of tractors and combines,'' the newsletter said. Inland spokesman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Nekvasil </PERSON> said some companies that depend on river traffic stalled by drought-lowered waters may reduce steel orders if they ca n't move their own finished products to market. <PERSON> Kuebler </PERSON> said smaller ore loads increase shipping costs by about 10 percent. That has not yet translated into an increase in steel prices, he said. Nevertheless, orders for steel remain strong, said <PERSON> Nekvasil </PERSON>. `` We continue to see business conditions strong,'' he said. `` I certainly would n't see anything that would threaten recovery or profitability. There's a very strong market for steel today.''

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 IC Industries, the diversified producer of Pet food products and Midas mufflers, said Tuesday its second-quarter profit climbed 21 percent on an 18 percent revenue gain. IC reported net income of $ 55.8 million, or 52 cents a share, for the three months ended June 30, compared with $ 46 million, or 41 cents a share, for the same period a year ago. Second-quarter revenue increased to $ 857.7 million from $ 729 million, the company said. IC's soft-drinks division, including its <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bottlers </ORGANIZATION> joint venture with <ORGANIZATION> Pepsico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, was the most improved sector with sales of nearly $ 237 million, a 54 percent increase from a year ago.

 Lawmakers unveiled a wide-ranging relief bill for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s drought-stricken farmers Tuesday, promising payments of up to $ 100,000 to keep them on the land despite the withering heat and lack of rain.

Lawmakers did not give an estimate of the cost of the relief legislation but expressed their resolve not to allow drought to set off a rash of bankruptcies in the countryside, just as the farm economy is shaking off the painful stagnation of the early 1980s. `` We're not going to allow their lives as farmers and ranchers to end because of a freak of nature,'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., said Both the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Agriculture committees opened hearings on the bill on Tuesday. The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel, Rep. E. `` Kika'' de la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said it `` would send the wrong signal'' to leave the job unfinished in August when lawmakers flee <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s heat. He added that he was hopeful the panel could dispense with any parade of witnesses from farm lobbies and instead act this week on any changes congressmen want to make in the draft bill. Senate Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., also called for `` quick action'' on the legislation because the `` American farmer needs help It's that simple.'' `` We must make certain that our relief package is targeted to those who need the help,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said in a statement. `` There can be no windfalls for any individual or group. We owe that much to the farmers and the taxpayers.'' <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> was briefing <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members on the long, hot dry spell when aides arrived from the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> five blocks away with a fresh forecast that the drought would cut this year's corn output to around 5.2 billion bushels, down from 7.06 billion last year. Under the proposed legislation, disaster payments would be capped at $ 100,000 for each individual farmer. Payments would represent 65 percent of pre-drought expected earnings, whether from target prices, price-support loans or market prices. But they would apply only to losses in excess of 35 percent of the crop. A 50 cent reduction per hundredweight in dairy price supports scheduled to start next year would be canceled under the legislation. Dairymen say such an action is warranted by skyrocketing feed costs, although it was one of their prime goals long before the drought set in. Government emergency feed programs already in effect would be overhauled and made available to a broader range of farmers. The drought has burned away a considerable amount of hay and thus put feed at a premium. Wheat, feed grains, cotton and rice producers would not be required to refund to the government any deficiency payments they have received in advance. The income-support payments represent the difference between the market value of their harvest and its value at higher, so-called target prices set by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> under the 1985 farm program and adjusted annually by the secretary of agriculture. Market prices have climbed steadily closer to target prices in anticipation of a diminished harvest, and thus the drought has reduced federal income-support payments as well. The drying up of these subsidies at a time when farmers have fewer crops to take to market threatens to hurt some of them. To complicate matters, many farmers have received 40 percent of their deficiency payments from the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> in advance and will have to refund a portion of them unless rescued by relief legislation. Another key provision would help farmers convert from production of corn, cotton and a variety of other crops to soybean production without paying certain financial penalties under the farm program. The provision is being closely watched in the farm and segments of the financial communities because soybeans are expected to be in short supply as a result of the drought and prices already are soaring.

 <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> posted a second-quarter profit of $ 145 million on Tuesday, a 23 percent increase over the same period a year earlier. The $ 145 million profit for second-quarter amounted to $ 1.44 a share, compared with a profit of $ 118 million, or $ 1.20 a share, in the same period last year. Second-quarter sales rose to $ 2.6 billion, up 26 percent from $ 2.1 billion a year earlier. For the first half of the year, <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 263 million, or $ 2.60 a share, compared to $ 34 million, or 35 cents per share, for the first half of 1987. First-half revenue rose to $ 4.98 billion from $ 3.74 billion a year earlier. <PERSON> Polzin </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> achieved record sales and robust profit levels despite higher costs for materials such as steel, and problems caused by a weakening of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar overseas. The world's largest manufacturer of earth-moving equipment finished in the black for the fifth consecutive quarter and said it expects company sales for the year will `` substantially exceed sales in 1987.'' <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Polzin </PERSON> said 1987 sales of $ 8.18 billion represented the company's best performance since 1981, when it had record sales of $ 9.15 billion. Only three months ago, the company said its sales would match the growth which occurred in 1987. `` Economic growth will be faster this year than assumed earlier,'' <PERSON> Polzin </PERSON> said. `` And replacement demand will be stronger than expected.'' <PERSON> Polzin </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> also is commanding higher prices than expected for its products and pleased with the acceptance of several recently introduced models. Caterpillar is rebuilding from a market collapse in 1981 which led to three years of losses that amounted to $ 950 million. A general overcapacity in the industry and fierce competition at home and abroad combined during the early 1980s to hurt <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION>. The company has fought back to financial health with a cost-cutting program. Savings were made by closing plants and massive layoffs, including slashing its Peoria-area workforce in half, eliminating about 18,000 positions.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>

 <ORGANIZATION> USG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it had reached an out-of-court settlement of its 2-month-old lawsuit charging <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> with attempting to profit from the illegal use of confidential information. USG, the country's leading producer of gypsum wallboard and other building materials, would not reveal the terms of the agreement. The lawsuit, filed May 3 in U.S. District Court in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, stemmed from <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>'s involvement in an attempted hostile takeover of USG by <ORGANIZATION> Desert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> L.P. </ORGANIZATION>, a partnership headed by oilmen <PERSON> Cyril </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Harvard Business School To Require Ethics Course This Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Honesty and fairness will be in the curriculum at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> starting this fall, when all students entering the graduate school will be required to take a three-week course in ethics. After the Wall Street insider trading scandal broke in 1986, the nation's business schools, <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> included, were criticized for not stressing ethics in their teachings of future business managers. `` We want to send a signal early on that these issues are important to the organization,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Piper </PERSON>, one of the professors who will teach the course at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>, said in Tuesday's editions of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Piper </PERSON> defined the teaching of ethics as instilling the values of respect, honesty, trust and fairness and said the key was to show that ethics are part of the decision-making process for managers. The ungraded course will begin the second week of the term. The school also plans to have more discussion of ethics in its regular courses and has hired research assistants to develop material. Workshops will be held for faculty members. Fewer than 10 percent of business schools require students to take ethics, according to ethics specialist <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Bentley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. Last year, <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> received $ 20 million from former <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Shad </PERSON> for the teaching of ethics. <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>'s critics, including some faculty members, had questioned the school's commitment to teaching ethics. Some critics suggested at the time of Shad's gift that <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> got interested in the subject only when it got the money. The school countered that ethics already were taught in many of its regular courses and a separate course was not needed. <PERSON> Piper </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> that after one year of study, <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> decided on a dual approach _ a separate mini-course and more discussion of ethics in other courses. He said ethics always had been taught at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> but may have been squeezed out over time. Interest in doing more came before the Wall Street scandal, he said, but the scandal made people realize `` that the pendulum may have swung too far.'' Last year, <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Bok </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> he did not think professors at the business school `` are able to put ethics into their courses at the level they should.'' `` There is a dangerous tendency on the part of some people to say that ethics is something we all know about,'' <PERSON> Bok </PERSON> said.
